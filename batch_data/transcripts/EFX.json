Baird & Co Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital Operator : Good day and welcome to the quarter one, 2014 Equifax earnings release call. Today's conference is being recorded.  At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Dodge. Please go ahead sir. Jeff Dodge : Thanks and good morning everyone. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Jeff Dodge, Investor Relations and with me today are Rick Smith, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Lee Adrean, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section, in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com.  During this call we'll be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our businesses are set forth in the filings with the SEC, including our 2013 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. We will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measure, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax that will be adjusted for certain items which effect the comparability of the underlining operation performance. Adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes acquisition-related amortization expense and the associated tax effects. This measure was detailed in our non-GAAP reconciliation tables, included with our earnings release and also posted on our website. Also, please refer to our various investor presentations, which are posted in the Investor Relations section, under the About Equifax tab on the website for further details. Now I'd like to turn it over to Rick. Rick Smith : Thanks Jeff and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us this morning. As I always do, I\u2019ll start off with a couple of high-level comments on how the company performed in the first quarter. I'll then gravitate towards some details at the business unit level and then come back to the corporate level and give you an update on a couple of key initiatives company wide, and Lee will go through his detailed financials and we\u2019ll come back and look at the second quarter, the balance of the year and then we\u2019ll do some Q&A.  Our first quarter performance, in our opinion was solid. We came in a little bitter than we had initial expected, all the business units continued their strong execution of their strategic initiatives and that will enable us to offset both the mortgage and the currency headwinds, which we described here during our last quarter call for the fourth quarter. For the first quarter revenue was up 3% to $585 million on a reported basis, about 5% on local currency basis versus the first quarter 2013. The strategic acquisitions, which we recently completed, are enabling us to further leverage our core business assets and drive new sources of growth.  Early stage integrations are off to a good start and we are optimistic that all the acquisitions we made late fourth quarter and the first quarter will bode well for us going forward.  For the quarter our core non-mortgage market growth rate was 7%, solidly in the range we had targeted, about 6% to 8%. Operating margin was 26%, down slightly from 26.3% a year ago and our adjusted EPS was $0.89, up from $0.87 last year. Our U.S. now are going to the individual business units, starting with USCIS. They delivered another solid quarter with strong execution. Their initiatives are consistent with our expectations. USCIS core non-mortgage market organic growth for the quarter was a solid 6%. They are continuing to leverage innovations, to develop and deliver unique insights to the customers through partnerships and multi-product offerings that leverage our unique capabilities. I\u2019ll give you a few examples there. First is, we\u2019ve announced recently the partnerships with IHS, you remember HIS versus Polk last year.  So we announced this partnership, we\u2019re going to develop product offering for one of our focus verticals we talked to you about and that\u2019s automotive. Our first product is lost sales analysis for lenders, which helps them understand an actual situations where they lost good opportunities to competitors and helped them build a strategy to not loose those in the future. Off to a great start, automotive is a great growth vehicle for us going forward.  Another example, we\u2019ve have identified a number of opportunities for integrating multiple data assets along with some of our proprietary analytics to develop what we call \u2018super scores\u2019 that enable our customers to make better decisions on higher risk opportunities about something they would normally pass on and they now able to underwrite those risks. The market interest is increasing nicely and our customers are increasingly focused on growing their running portfolios.  We talked about Mobile Commerce. We\u2019ve got a great initiative, a partner called Jumio. They are a next-generation payments and ID company to help our customers maximize their opportunity with Mobile Commerce, while reducing fraud and streamlining mobile payments; really exciting early state opportunity.  In the mortgage space we continue to bundle undisclosed debt monitoring, which we\u2019ve talked to you about our 4506-T product, verification of employment, verification of income and bundle all those products to a very unique decision platform, which we have in a mortgage market and these solutions are allowing us to increase our market penetration and to drive growth. This continues innovation in this large market has enabled us to mitigate the impact of the market decline, while positioning us to accelerate faster when the market conditions improve.  We\u2019ve seen the MBA data for the quarter; we\u2019ve seen how we\u2019ve outperformed the MBA. We\u2019ll talk about that in the Q&A as well and that\u2019s largely driven by our unique offerings in our new decision platform. In Fraud and ID Management we\u2019ve made significant progress, particularly in the government sector. We are providing identity authentication for selected IRS portals in support of the strategic goals for reducing fraud, improving service, extending processes and improving efficiencies. We are also undertaking projects for health and human services, leveraging our proactive fraud solutions products and we continue to sign new accounts in the state agency market with our identity proofing services. International; its a critical long term growth early for us and in the first quarter they performed well. Retained a little over 24% constant dollar growth, driven by solid organic growth in addition to contributions from their recent acquisitions. In the midst of integrating TDX, you recall, quite a few hits recently and we are aggressively working on a plan, not only to integrate them, but to take their capabilities and solutions to countries outside their current footprint. They are predominately if you recall U.K. based company, we saw our operations in Spain and Australia. We have high hopes that this is going to have a fit in places like Canada, Argentina, Brazil and the U.S. and teams are working diligently to lay those plans out for execution later on this year. We now have InterConnect implemented in five additional countries with a sales pipeline extended into six other countries. InterConnect ultimately enable us to deliver Decision 360 products in these counties and most importantly as you know we\u2019ll get these decision platforms ingrained into our good customers, our stake in this goes up significantly.  In our non-consolidated investments overseas, both Russia and India are exceeding our expectations. We also made very good progress with our Brazilian partners and expect solid growth with them in 2014 and beyond.  Following an outstanding performance in 2013, Workforce Solutions delivered core non-mortgage market, organic growth of 10% in the first quarter, another outstanding quarter for Workforce Solutions. They continue to deepen our penetration of many of our existing served markets, while broadening the markets they serve with unique high value products.  For the first time in a long time, home equity lending is up dramatically and the need for employment and income verification services provides new growth opportunities for us. We are at the very early stages of home equity lending coming back and late in the first quarter we started seeing the benefit of that. We expect that to continue throughout the balance of the year.  One of Workforce Solutions newest offerings is getting very good attraction. The solution offering the ACA Management Platform provides customers with automated dashboards that enable them to evaluate, track and report their compliance with the Affordable Care Act.  If you recall few years ago we acquired eThority, which is a major analytics company. We leveraged that capability to help our customers, employers be sure they are complying with the Affordable Care Act. We have now signed up more than 100 major organizations with this platform to ensure they are compliant; exciting for those guys. In another way we bring analytics to every part of our company, now including EWS. We are also making good progress on our targets on the Work Number database. We now have almost 3,400 companies contributing their Work Number records up 7% from year-end. Our records are now exceeding 240 million in our database and we are well on our way to reaching our short term goal, which we\u2019ll talk to you about, of 250 million total records and 7 million active records will soon come back with a new base line for your larger target going forward and any other implications of that.  Finally our contract with CMS, Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services was renewed for another year. If you recall we signed the contract a year ago. It was a one-year contract with one-year renewals they have come back and have renewed it. We could talk about that in the Q&A session as well, but getting off to a good start there.  Personal Solutions continue to make good progress with the integration of TrustedID, while continuing to execute at a high level on the strategic initiatives. TrustedID has been successful in opening up new growth opportunities for PSOL in indirect market and providing us with opportunities to redirect our resources to better address the change in the competitive landscape.  In fact I think as we look forward to the next, one, two, three, four years of indirect market we\u2019ll be in fact the significant growth driver within PSOL. And PSOL on the core business, they kind of tweak their business model to address the inroads being made by free scores, free services, marketing expenditures in that core business have been reduced a bit, which is resulting in over time higher profits and slightly lower growth we talked to you about last quarter, that combined a great combination with indirect and direct.  Finally North American commercial solutions began the integration of Forseva, whose decisions platform enable us to deliver high value decision solutions to small business information market. High single digit growth in transaction revenues for the quarter were largely offset by a decline in the project-oriented revenues. You know the project revenue can be lumpy, but the good news is we are seeing the transaction revenue growing, which is a good sign.  A couple of quite highlights for the company now. As you all know, successfully executing on all of our enterprise wide initiatives in a critical comparative to us. The management\u2019s discipline that underpin our ability to execute a high level and ingrained almost every time, we give you a couple of examples. As you know seven years ago we launched NPI, New Product Innovation Program. We\u2019ve had great success over the seven years. In fact 2013 represented our largest revenue contribution from products over the previous three years. At this juncture, with seven years into it and to keep it fresh we have launched a new program called NPI 2.0, which is really to reinvigorate NPI innovation across the enterprise to again like four, five years of great runway from NPI. We launched that earlier this year, it\u2019s off to a great start.  LEAN continues to be an important part of our DNA. Its delivering significant benefits internally, which we talked about, but also externally with our customers who engaged us to help them operate more efficiently and more effective, another way to differentiate ourselves from the competition.  As we enter 2014 I expected the first quarter to be the most challenging quarter we\u2019ve faced due to the fact we had mortgage headwinds. The sluggish economy, that\u2019s weather and FX. It was a difficult environment, but in that environment this team brought a very, very solid performance and as I looked at the balance of the year we started to see signs of strengthened economies around the global in which we operate. We are seeing that the mortgage headwinds will start to abate towards the end of this quarter, improve a little bit in the third quarter and with wins back in the fourth quarter.  We continue to executive at very high level on our innovation. The things that we\u2019re doing on vertical focus is really making a difference and I can tell you, I\u2019ve seen more share gains and wins in the market place in these key verticals with the Decision 360 platform, than I have seen since we\u2019ve launched Decision 360 a number of years ago. So I believe right now we are saying with the convergence of all these good things, it will position us very well towards the balance of 2014 and into 2015. So, with that Lee. Lee Adrean : Thanks Rick and good morning everyone. This morning I'll be referring to the financial results from continuing operations generally presented on a GAAP basis. Our first quarter performance was solid in the phase of the challenging mortgage headwinds, which we anticipated. As we indicated during our fourth quarter release, those headwinds will continue into the second quarter and moderate substantially in the second half. Our full year outlook has not changed.  Let me turn to the quarterly results. Compared to the same quarter in 2013, for the first quarter of 2014 consolidated revenue of $585 million was up 3% on a reported basis and up 5% on a constant currency basis, when compared to the first quarter of 2013.  Operating margin was 26%, down slightly from 26.3% in the first quarter of 2013. Diluted earnings per share attributable to Equifax was $0.67 per share. Excluding acquisition related amortization, adjusted EPS was $0.89 up from $0.87 in the first quarter 2013.  Moving to the individual business units, our U.S. Consumer Information Solutions revenue was $244 million, essentially flat when compared to the first quarter of 2013. Our core non-mortgage market organic growth, including strategic initiatives contributed approximately 6% to growth, although decline in mortgage market volumes subtracted 6% from growth. Online Consumer Information Solutions revenue was $179 million, up 2%. Core credit decisioning transaction volume was up 9%, while average revenue per transaction declined 8%. The decline in revenue per transaction resulted from fewer mortgage related transactions, which are typically at higher than average per transaction and from expansion that select larger financial institutions in Telco\u2019s, which have lower than average pricing due to their size.  Mortgage solutions revenue of $24 million was down 18% compared to the fist quarter of 2013. This compares very favorably to the mortgage bankers application index, which is down 54% in the first quarter. Consumer financial marketing services revenue was $41 million, up 3% when compared to the year ago quarter and the operating margin for U.S. Consumer Information Solutions was 38.9% up from 37.5% in the first quarter of 2013.  Our international business unit\u2019s revenue was $144 million, up 16% on a reported basis and up 24% on a local currency basis. The acquisitions we that completed in the fourth quarter and first quarter contributed approximately 15 percentage points at the local currency growth. Strong organic growth was aided by above average growth in small and medium enterprises, government insurance and utilities. By region, Europe\u2019s revenue was $66 million, up 48% in U.S. dollars and up 39% in local currency, driven by the acquisition of TDX and upper single digit organic growth in our core business. Latin America\u2019s revenue is $47 million, flat in U.S. dollars, but up 23% in local currency, driven about equally by organic growth in technology and analytic services, marketing services and by the acquisitions in Paraguay and Mexico. Canada consumer information revenue was $31 million, down 4% in U.S. dollars, but up 5% in local currency, driven primarily by solid growth in information solutions and technology and analytical services.  International\u2019s operating margin was 20.4% compared to 28.1% in 2013. Approximately half of the decline resulted from the increased acquisition related amortization expense of $5.8 million related to producing acquisitions. The remaining decline resulted from seasonality in our newly acquired TDX business and inflation driven pressures on margin in Argentina. We expect to exit the year with operating margin over 25%. Workforce Solutions revenue was $120 million for the quarter, down 3% when compared to the first quarter in 2013. Verification Services with revenue of $64 million was down 7% when compared to the same quarter in 2013. Strong growth in government and pre-employment partially offset the 31% decline in mortgage-related revenues. Revenue in our non-mortgage customer segments was up 16%.  Employer Services revenue was $56 million, up 1% compared to last year. The Workforce Solutions overall operating margin was 32.3% compared to 30.3% in the first quarter of 2013, driven primarily by the benefit of reduced acquisition amortization, offset partially by the negative effect of lower revenue against the primarily fixed cost expense base.  North America Personal Solutions revenue was $54 million, up 6%. Growth was driven primarily by the acquisition of TrustedID. Solid mid single digit growth in U.S. subscription revenues and strong growth in Canada were largely offset by declining revenue in breach and transaction products. Operating margin for Personal Solutions was 28.2% compared to 28.4% in the first quarter a year ago. North American Commercial Solutions revenue was $23 million, flat on a reported basis and up 2% on a local currency basis, driven by growth in transaction revenue, partially offset by weakness in project oriented revenues. The operating margin was 19.4% compared to 21.3% in the year ago quarter. Now, let me turn it back to Rick. Rich Smith : Thanks Lee. Before we go to Q&A, I thought I\u2019ll just give you a couple of thoughts front up and how we think about the remainder of 2014 and how we think about \u2013 our overviews of 2015. One, our core organic non-mortgage market growth of 6% to 8% we talked about for a number of years remains solid and we continue to make great progress on all of our initiatives, to ensure we deliver in that range as we did in the first quarter.  Secondly, the integration of the acquisitions we\u2019re talking about are on track and we\u2019re more optimistic about the potential for TDX and Inffinix together with different markets than at the of the acquisition and these acquisitions are expected to move, to be accretive towards the back end of this year. Three, as we talked about in the largely through the mortgage headwinds, that will start to abate as we exit the second quarter and continue to abate in the third quarter and put it in the fourth quarter and they are coming back in 2014.  At this point the foreign exchange headwinds we\u2019re talking about and we\u2019re probably getting more, seeing some stability there and when we put that all together it says that at this juncture, versus the fourth quarter earnings call that we did, Lee and I would be more confident in the outlook for the balance of this year and 2015 as we still have time. We still have to execute obviously as a company.  As was always, we reconfirm our full year guidance; we gave it in the last call. We expect core organic non-mortgage to grow there in the 6% to 8% acquisition added to our growth to our FX and mortgage will continue to be headwinds and going through the second quarter and the early third quarter very much as we expected, which is encouraging. We should expect the total, revenue for he total year to be $2.425 billion and $2.475 billion and our adjusted EPS as we told you in the last call between $2.75 a share and $2.89 a share. In the second quarter we expect reported revenue between $606 million and $619 million and adjusted EPS between $0.92 and $0.95, so very much in line with what we\u2019ve expected from the year. So with that operator we\u2019d like to open up the phones for some questions. Operator :  Thank you. (Operator Instructions). We\u2019ll go to our first question with Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets. Dan Perlin - RBC Capital Markets : Thanks. Good morning guys. So I wanted to \u2013 Rick there\u2019s a lot of things your throwing out in terms of initiatives that are taking place and I just wanted to parse it a little bit, when we think about this conviction going into the second half and I guess what I\u2019m trying to figure out is, how much of the benefit really needs to be kind of cyclical and then the second part is, versus what I would consider to be kind of contractual obligations or what your seeing kind of spool up in all of your new products. I\u2019m just trying to split those two a bit. Rick Smith : Yes, it\u2019s tough to quantify the exact breakup. But let me give you some color around it Dan. One, vertical markets, the we\u2019ve doing, and have been doing that for a couple of years, focus on verticals like autos, for example insurance, Telco are very more frequently anticipate just a few months ago, a few quarters ago, that\u2019s number one.  Number two, like we mentioned the acquisitions that we have, which are great strategically and they become accretive a the back end of year, that helps us.  And two, the mortgage market, as I said before, is abating almost as expected. So it really comes down to continuing to do the things that the group has been doing for a number of years now, focusing on customers needs, bundling price together in a unique way to solve this problem and executing on a high level. That combined with a little bit of market help. I think the economy will start to improve, we\u2019re seeing it in some of data right now in many parts of the world., is that the economy is improving; that helps us as well. Dan Perlin - RBC Capital Markets : Okay, and then on the home equity lending side, you know that sounds like something that\u2019s new and could be meaningful. When we think about that, I guess how fast are you seeing that kind of pace or play now and is that something that also gives you some confidence as you think about second half and just, I want to be clear where that falls in the P&L. Is that in verification services or is that up in somewhere else. Thanks. Rick Smith : Great question Dan. Its early stages and I\u2019m very encouraged. We saw some nice volume in the end of the first quarter, we expect that to continue in the second quarter. So I think you'll see that home equity is right at the historical numbers in home equity loans in the marketplace. You\u2019ll see us returning closer to more normal levels versus the fresh levels we\u2019ve had last four or five years. As far as where it shows up, it predominantly shows up in our EWS business and verification of employment and income. Dan Perlin - RBC Capital Markets : Okay, and then just a last one, congratulations on renewing the CMS deal. But now we\u2019ve got some framework for numbers around that. Should we come to expect that the contractual minimums is something that is just the jumping off point and you guys should earn a lot more of that revenue possibly into \u201914. Thanks, I\u2019ll jump off. Rick Smith : Yes, sure I hope so Dan. Thank you for you for the congratulations on the renewal. Dan Adams is a doing a heck of a job with CMS for the last 18 months is secure, has been re-secured. There\u2019s a lot of noise in this, and frontline of 8 million people who have signed up and you should think about it around the contractual minimums at this point and as far as ramp up you know I expect that in 2015, not 2014. Dan Perlin - RBC Capital Markets : Okay, thank you. Rick Smith : Sure. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Paul Ginocchio with Deutsche Bank. Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank : Thanks. I think we talked about that IHS JV that you said it was your first product. Can you just elaborate on that? Is there potentially more products in the pipeline with them. Thank you. Rick Smith : Yes, thanks Paul. Yes, it\u2019s pretty cool. Lee and his team have been working with Polk, a standalone company for a number of years now and the good news is post IHS acquisition of Polk the doors have continued to remain open. The see us a unique provider of solutions for the automotive vertical, they know this is a unique focus for us. So we've already had a couple, I mentioned one on the call which is the lost sales analysis, which is really, its helps the underwriters of risk understand why they lost the risk, how to place the risk, where the ultimate buyer ends up going and why and how they might reposition the next offering better to reduce churn of loss sales.  That is one of the many products that we are currently working with IHS on. And again, I think that\u2019s an example. Maybe goes back to Dan\u2019s question of what\u2019s different, is when we restructure a company we want deep execution on different verticals like auto. You get intimate with that industry and you understand their needs and challenges. So our ability to bundle our new products is so important now and so much more effective than it would have been and that sales analysis with IHS is one example. Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank : Great. If I could just ask a follow-up to Lee. Lee, any way to give us what the total acquired revs were in the first quarter, and what the rough range would be for the second quarter? Lee Adrean : I don\u2019t know about the dollars, but the growth was about 4%, contributed 4% to growth, so it would be roughly 4% against last year\u2019s revenue, that\u2019s in the low 20\u2019s. That will actually step up some in the second quarter, because we\u2019ll have a full quarter on TEX and also just the effective acquisition accounting. When you first do an acquisition you loose some of the differed revenue that the acquired company may have and that tends to affect the first period the most and then diminish over time. So you\u2019ll see a somewhat bigger effect on growth in the second quarter. There is about 4% in Q1 and the next quarter the growth and contribution is probably more like 5%. Rick Smith : If I remember the mortgage headwind cost us about six points relative to this quarter, is that right? Lee Adrean : Yes, and probably something roughly similar in the second quarter. It really doesn\u2019t start and then it falls off in the third and fourth quarter to much smaller impacts. Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank : Thank you very much. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from George Mihalos from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. George Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse : Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the solid quarter. I just wanted to dig in on the international side a little bit. Canada seemed to really accelerate from the fourth quarter. I just wonder what\u2019s driving that and then also it seems to me that Europe constant currency slowed a little bit. Is there anything going on there or are there any sort of variations that will sort of play out throughout the course of the year. Rick Smith : Yes, there is nothing unusual on either side that is either drawing optimism or concern, you got some seasonality in both areas. As I look at the long term forecast for both Europe, excluding Russia, but Europe is a little solid performance outperforming the marketplace growing at multiple of GDP. I see it continuing, but I don\u2019t see anything that is really unusual either on the upside or for the downside in that geography. Lee Adrean : And George I would add two things. One, on Canada we have had continued good success with our technology and analytical services offerings. We also saw a little bit stronger growth in just our traditional online credit reporting in the first quarter and I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any predictability to that. It will strengthen or weaken a little bit from time to time. I think Canada continues to be in the low to mid single digit kind of core organic growth trend. On Europe you know, we\u2019ve been indicating that last year it tended to run at very high single digits on organic growth, but looking at a very relatively stagnant U.K. economy and the weak Spain economy reflected just great performance in growth on our part, but we\u2019ve been flagging. That could moderate a little bit and I think that\u2019s what we saw, that it continues to perform well across a number of product and customer segments. Rick Smith : Yes, I think the organic growth in Europe is about 8%. Lee Adrean : 7%. Rick Smith : 7% for the quarter, so we think that those two economies, that continue to be fully processed. George Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse : Okay great, that\u2019s very helpful. And just one more question Lee, the general corporate expenses were down considerably year-on-year. What\u2019s driving that and how should we think about that line item going forward as it compares to your revenue growth. Thank you. Lee Adrean : The corporate line in addition to having certain of the corporate staff expenses, which tend to be pretty stable, include the number of activities that are project related, discretionary, certain investments that we make that are corporate wide and that line can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. It was down year-over-year in the first quarter, which would not be the normal trend. I would say that you should expect for the year, that the corporate line will be up, but by less than revenue, but you will see fluctuations quarter-to-quarter as we have seen some times in the past. George Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel: Hi, good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Hey Rick, I want to focus a little bit more on the super scores. It seems to me that if I look over the last kind of seven years or so at Equifax, went through a period of focusing more on buying unique assets and then a period of kind of I guess that\u2019s you are still in, in terms of integrating the different assets and it seems like the end game or at least part of the end game should be coming up with a lot more of these super scores in areas where your competitors can\u2019t do that. Can you talk about where \u2013 which verticals do you feel like you have that in and where you think you have a lot of potential and how important that is for kind of the strategic revenue growth of the business overall? Rick Smith : Yes, good question. As I think about the tenants, the long-term growth for the company, kind of new area source and talking to you in the past about fraud and ID, prevention as being one, we talked about analytical solutions being another. So clearly we\u2019re investing in a very heavy rate. We brought a great guy in, who's steeped in his understanding of and developing of analytical products. He's done analytics for Hewlett-Packard and he has been for about a year now.  So one, having the focus and the talent around analytics, and two, having the unique data assets available to build those new analytics and insights. I think we\u2019re in a pretty good position, so its clearly a place where we have been and will continue to make a bet on investments in because I think we are uniquely positioned because of our unique data assets. As far as verticals, its going to start off with the verticals where we think we\u2019re uniquely positioned with our unique dated assets, automotive is one, mortgage is one, Telco is one, insurance is one. To start with those are the key areas we can start and maybe also (Inaudible). Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel: How far along do you feel you are in terms of coming out with some of these super scores? Do you feel like there\u2019s lot of open terrain in front of you? Rick Smith : I do for one primary reason we have developed some technical capabilities that maybe was to \u2013 maybe write the data in different ways than we could before, to do it real-time and do it cost-efficiently. Those capabilities have started late last year, early this year that continue to be the third quarter and I expect us to be in position where we can run a much faster rate, in an economical way in the fourth quarter this year. It's early days but very encouraging days. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel: Okay, great. Just jumping back to the ACA question, are you seeing these amount of sign ups actually flowing through and kind of hitting your numbers in terms of expanding the revenue for you guys? Rick Smith : Yes, yes, great question. To make sure I understand it, I\u2019ll expand on time the differences. We have a analytical capability that builds a company. They said give us all of your data and with that data we can analyze and tell if your complying with Affordable Care Act. Two revenue streams that have been important to acknowledge; one is we charge those hundred plus companies for that analytical solution.  Secondly, in many cases those companies that were using our platform, our analytics have not been Work Number contributors in the past. So we use this platform, analytics platform to not only solve their problem. But in many cases added a Work Number database, which has exceeded our expectations so far and so the monetization of that is once you get on the database, people start hitting that database, looking for verification and for an income and you know if those record, cost records looks like there. So there\u2019s two revenue streams. The latter, Work Number database lags obviously you get it at the end, cleansed and people start hitting it, project revenues is more immediate. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel: What about the substance coming from the government? I\u2019m trying to understand, there\u2019s a big number that the government put out and just if you do some machinations around them, I\u2019m trying to figure out, based on the levels of sign ups and where your seeing the revenue flow, they hit the quarterly $50 million, $60 million year potential that contract would imply. Rick Smith : Okay great question, and again the governments proclaimed 7 million to 8 million people that have signed up. There is so much more, in those numbers than you\u2019ve expected. So again you can find that many of those people are retired people, so there\u2019s more people on the record at this juncture.  So we are not seeing \u2013 I think someone asked the question earlier. If you think about 2014, think more in the framework of the minimum security by CMS and my hope is if this thing ramps up in 2015 and beyond, you\u2019ll see revenues move well beyond the minimums, its too early to claim that now. So as I said in the past calls, as we more and more get smarter to see what\u2019s occurring in the market place you guys will be the first to know. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel: Okay if I can, I want to squeeze in one. I want to ask a housekeeping one for Lee. You purchased a 0.4 million shares, the share account still went up a little bit. Is there a kind of a timing difference, is it a stock price or issuance in the equity timing. How should we think of that in terms of repurchases? Lee Adrean : Yes, I haven\u2019t looked at it quite that closely. But we probably need to buy between 1 million and 1.25 million shares over the course of the year to offset the effected equity compensation. I have the average shares that could be timing. I don\u2019t know have it right in front of me, the ending shares. My guess is the ending shares many have come down just slightly. But the average shares would be affected when it comes to that timing. We would have been buying relatively late in the quarter, because of the timing of our year-end earnings release. So its probably a function of timing and the effect on weighted average shares. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel: Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll move on to our next question from David Togut with Evercore. Rena Kumar \u2013 Evercore: Good morning. This is Rena Kumar for David Togut. You discussed a lot of your new products in your opening remarks. Can you just call out which of your new products made the biggest contribution to revenue in the quarter? Rick Smith : I don\u2019t have that off the top of my head, but again you got to put it in perspective. We launched anywhere from 15 to 75 new products every year. Have been so for about seven years, so its truly broad based. We don\u2019t typically look at or get what you call home runs with products. In total it ends up being a significant number of goals. As you know there\u2019s a vitality mix of 10% and 11% coming from possibly just three years ago. So it tends to be a bunch of singles and doubles and it\u2019s truly in almost every geography we have around the world. Lee Adrean : I can give a couple of examples, some of the bigger categories. The products that we have developed from the Telco positive database are relatively larger products that have developed in the mortgage base, taking advantages of our additional sources of data. We\u2019re bringing some of our technology decision in platforms much more broadly across our international space, and there we have high-end platforms and low-end platforms depending on the size and sophistication of our customers.  Some of the things we\u2019ve down with identity authentication are another one of the larger categories that we\u2019ve brought out. So those are a couple of the product families that have been the most significantly over the last year. Rick Smith : And just \u2013 that\u2019s a good point Lee. For your benefit, those categories have been largely consistent, not just this first quarter, but as you said the last year or two, that\u2019s an area of focus. Kumar \u2013 Evercore: Great, and if you can just discuss your current acquisition pipeline. Rick Smith : Yes, at this juncture we are really focused on integrating TDX, Inffinix, Paraguay and taking strategically the Inffinix and TDX platforms as I mentioned earlier to different geography. I think that\u2019s a key to the business occupying for quite some time.  For M&A, we continue to look at M&A. We\u2019re focused more on strategic tuck-ins than there are large deals and so it\u2019ll always be an important part of our strategy. There\u2019s noting that\u2019s imminent to talk about this juncture. Rena Kumar \u2013 Evercore: Thank you. Rick Smith :   Sure. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Nick Nikitas from Robert Baird. Nick Nikitas - Robert W. Baird & Co: Yes, thanks for taking the question. You mentioned continued expectations from mortgage improvement. I think last quarter you guys quantified your MBA expectations. Could you put a number on that for 2Q if possible? Rick Smith : Let me speak from memory. Maybe you have that later Jeff. We talked about \u2013 the MBA was \u2013 talked about being done probably in the first half of the year, modestly in the second half of the year, total year down by 30% for the year. Second quarter will improve over first quarter is it is down 15%. It maybe down 20% to 30% for the second quarter. Does that sound about right. Lee Adrean : My word of caution on the MBA industry is that we have had difficultly over time tightly correlating our revenue growth, but even some of the flow of closed mortgage loans with the MBA industries. There\u2019s a lot of different sources for data. You can look at different economists and they forecast different things. So there is a lot attention on the MBA indices. Its as good an index as others, but the correlation is a little loose. So be careful about using that as our \u2013 a benchmark for our revenue. Rick Smith : Does someone known what the published MBA is? Lee Adrean : The Q2 forecast? Rick Smith : The trend is everyone is expecting mortgage in general, beyond MBA. The mortgage market in the second quarter was a modestly better than the first quarter. Nick Nikitas - Robert W. Baird & Co: Okay, that helps. And you mentioned the NPI 2.0 introductions. Could you just talk more about what your doing differently there and then just in general the pipeline for that product line. Rick Smith : Yes, I think it\u2019s more of a process than a product line. NPI was launched seven years ago and after we\u2019ve waited for seven years, it runs the risk of becoming somewhat stale, when the entitlement sets in.  So its just our way of reenergizing, redefining the parameters on NPI, think about NPI. How you get new ideas in from clients and working with VC firms and Silicon Valley firms. Just to continue to make sure we got great ideas coming through the funnel. So its our way of reenergizing it and we started it late last year and its off to a great start. My hope is that this keeps the energy around NPI going for another four, five years. Nick Nikitas - Robert W. Baird & Co: Okay, great, and just one last one for me. You talked about the vitality index in the past three-year contribution mix. I think previously you said that international sees a large benefit from that. Any other segments where you\u2019re kind of running above that 10% run rate? Is it pretty spread out across all of them? Rick Smith : It will ebb and flow, because sometimes you\u2019ll have large products in one particular venue that will run off in a particular year, so its accounted. The last four years, as you get into the fourth year, we\u2019re counted as part of the core to them, not the vitality. So every business unit will have its ups and downs if they have a good product launch in any one given year, so. Nick Nikitas - Robert W. Baird & Co: Okay, great. Thanks. Rick Smith : Good. Operator : We\u2019ll go ahead to our next question with Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital : Hey, good morning everybody. The first around the sort of new product and the partnerships you talked about. So firstly you know you mentioned auto obviously is a key vertical. You are partnering with IHS Polk. I was just wondering, over the longer term like what your appetite for acquisitions in that area is with respect to sort of building out that capability. And just around partnerships, I know you mentioned HIS. I was just wondering you guys had an announcement teaming up with CoreLogic as well. I was wondering you know how significant or incremental could that be? Rick Smith : As far as acquisitions, we\u2019ll obviously look. At this juncture as outlook is specifically auto to answer your question. A key focus here for us, I think we\u2019ve assembled unique data assets that we need to succeed there. I think we\u2019ve assembled the right partners and there are a number of key partners who have capability in the pipes into the automotive industry that they see the value we bring and we see the value they bring.  They tend to look towards commercial agreements versus hard core JVs at this juncture. I don\u2019t see we need to do anything on the M&A front, because that obviously may change. I think we can do as we have been doing and be quite successful. As far as CoreLogic, I\u2019m not going to break that out. The partnerships are important to us as we get into verticals and vertical focus, to find people like CoreLogic who are very good in a particular spacing and we\u2019re going to bring value and do bring value. It\u2019s a win-win situation. So we are not going to quantity the size of that. Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital : Fair enough. Your not quantifying it, but would that be an added lever in terms of offsetting the market growth more than what you already are doing. Rick Smith : Yes, I think so. I think you think of any time we can find it, it will bring value to the mortgage market that we couldn\u2019t bring in the past. That\u2019s offset the revenues, yes. Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital : Okay, and then Lee just on the margin side, I was just wondering if you\u2019d help us sort of cover the things out. So on the corporate expense line you said the total year number should be I guess higher than the 2013 number and you said less than growth. I\u2019m guessing up 10% or so. I just wanted to see if you give us a little more specificity there. And then on the international side, I think you said exit the year at 25%. I just wanted to clarify that meant the full year number should be 25% or just the fourth quarter should be the 25%? Lee Adrean : On the corporate expense I would expect that they growth probably in the range of 4% or 5%, although again that can change as we make decisions through the year on various projects and initiatives we want to undertake, but my current expectations would be, we might be looking at 4%, 5% growth for the year. In international, that 25% probably a reasonable number for the second half, but that\u2019s not a full year number, that\u2019s a half number. Particularly as we get TDX integrated, recognizing the seasonality of its business, as well as we get through the period where we\u2019re running off or is not able to recognize their past differed revenue, just give a nature lift in what TDX is contributing. Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital : And then for the second quarter international is similar to the first quarter? Lee Adrean : Probably a little bit better, but we\u2019re still below where we would expect it to be over time. Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital : Okay and just one last one, I don\u2019t know if I remember this, but in terms of the CMS minimums that you talked about that, have you guys disclosed that before? Rick Smith : I think we have. Jeff, hope you \u2013 have you given the numbers? Yes, we though that that number is around $8 million to $10 million. Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital : Okay, all right, thanks a lot guys. Rick Smith : Thank you. Okay, with that I\u2019d like to thank everybody for their interest and support in Equifax and with that operator we\u2019ll conclude the call. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. Mr. Jeff Dodge, I\u2019d like to turn the conference back to you for any additional and closing remarks. Jeffrey Dodge : No, there are none. Thank you. Operator : All right, that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation.",

Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Q2 2014 Equifax Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Dodge. Please go ahead, sir. Jeffrey L. Dodge: Thanks, and good morning to everybody. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Jeff Dodge, Investor Relations. And with me today are Rick Smith, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section of the About Equifax tab on our website at www.equifax.com. During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in the filings with the SEC, including our 2013 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. We will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax that will be adjusted for certain items, which affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance. Adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes the acquisition-related amortization expense and the associated tax effects. This measure is detailed in our non-GAAP reconciliation tables included with our earnings release and also posted on our website. Also, please refer to our various investor presentations, which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.equifax.com for further details. Now I'd like to turn it over to Rick. Richard F. Smith: Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Thanks to -- as always, for making time to join us on this call today. Before I jump into my -- to the overview of the strategic accomplishments for the second quarter, let me, at least by phone, introduce John Gamble. I think everyone knows John is our new CFO. John's been with us for about 2 months now, and off to a great start. As you would expect, the transition between Lee Adrean and John Gamble has been a very thoughtful one, a well-thought-out one, smooth and is going extremely well. John has inherited a really good team, good processes, and he's off to a great start. So John, welcome. And as always, after I go through my strategic update, John will jump in and give you the financials. And we'll both be here on John's first call to answer any questions you may have of either one of us. Our performance in the second quarter was very strong. It was above our guidance and it was really driven by a continued strong execution of our core strategic initiatives. And those initiatives, again, offset the mortgage headwinds that we saw in the first half of the year and that continued in the second quarter. And the execution that we continued to deliver positions us very well for a strong performance in the second half of 2014 and into 2015. For the quarter, revenue was $614 million, up 5% on a reported basis and 6% on local currency basis versus the second quarter of 2013. When you exclude the mortgage market headwinds and include our acquisitions that we made last year and some in the early part of this year, revenue grew 9% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currency. Our operating margins was off to a strong 27.3%, up from 26.9% a year ago. Our adjusted EPS was $0.96, up from $0.92 last year, and up from our guidance of $0.92 to $0.95. So I think any way you look at it, a really strong financial performance for us in the second quarter. And now we'll all go through each of the BUs with some detail there. First, with USCIS, and that team continues to innovate. It continues to have rigorous execution against these initiatives and as a result of broadening and deepening our customer relationships. And for the first half, their core non-mortgage market organic growth rate was a solid 6%, and I'll give you some details around that 6%, that good performance. With one of the top 4 banks in the United States, we have leveraged our successful implementation of the analytical sandbox, which we've talked to you about a number of times on this call. We've now taken that analytical sandbox to the next level. It's allowing us to develop tools to help them forecast. Our longer-term focus with this institution is to develop an insights-based, enterprise-wide analytics ecosystem that will support multiple decisioning applications, including modeling, forecasting, market analysis, account management and prospecting. So think of it this way, when we talked to you about a year ago, I think it was, about launching these very unique analytical sandboxes, we said there's multiple ways to make money. One was the actual implementation of sandbox, which that was at the time that we launched. The second phase we talked about was the ability to develop new products and capabilities. That's what this is all about, and that's what they're paying us for not the sandbox, but for the products and capabilities that come out of the sandbox. And the third potential bite of the apple we talked about was the potential of actually having them outsource their analytics to us, that's still to come. But a great, great step with one of the most important banks in the United States. Secondly, our enterprise-wide focus on key industry verticals broadens our reach and strengthens our competitive position. We recently signed a multiyear agreement with our largest insurance customer to build a prospecting database that will be their primary source for marketing campaigns. This particular opportunity was a competitive takeaway and further solidifies our exclusive relationship with a very large customer in one of the targeted growth sectors we talked to you about.  We are also deepening our relationship with customers by helping them drive synergies within their organization, create better standards and governance processes, reduce waste within the organization and improve the quality and effectiveness of their marketing efforts. For another top 4 bank, we are undertaking a 1-year professional service engagement to help them deploy Lean in their customer credit marketing organizations. So think about this, we deployed Lean which is a strength we've had in our company now for a number of years. When we deploy that into our customers' operations, especially like this, one of the top 4 banks, it positions us as a thought leader and different than our competition, which opens doors for revenue down the road. In our auto vertical, we have developed a unique solution, leveraging our Customer Services Database called the CDS -- CSD, and our patent pending fusion modeling technology. With this solution, one of the largest direct auto lenders, we'll be able to approve more applications real-time, improve its overall close rate in enhancing its competitive position with the auto dealers. Remember, the Consumer Services Database, CSD, as we call it, we used to call it NC+ [ph], that's our positive telco database. A combination of fusion modeling and that unique database is allowing us to gain share in the automotive vertical in the U.S. Again, another very important vertical for us for growth. Our Decision 360 strategy to provide unique high-value insights for customers' decision needs continues to be an important growth driver for us. We're a very large credit card issuer. We combine the verification of income with credit data for their credit line increased program. The solution will enable to be in compliance with the Reg Z requirements, while at the same time, providing additional insights to improve their overall decisioning on these opportunities. Another example how D360 is really making a difference in the marketplace. For 2014, we continued to expect USCIS to deliver non- -- deliver core non-mortgage market organic growth in their long-term growth range of 5% to 7%. On the International, they're making very good progress integrating the recent acquisitions, particularly TDX. If you recall, that was domiciled in the U.K. and Inffinix which is domiciled in Mexico, and delivering -- in developing our global collection strategy. The second quarter performance was in line with our expectations, demonstrating ability to deliver performance on both their critical strategic priorities and operational initiatives. Strong organic growth in the FI and SME segments were the principle drivers of growth for International. PSol in Europe continues to deliver strong double-digit growth, up 32% from the second quarter of 2013. I think, you'll recall, we have deployed the efforts of Trey Loughran in the U.S. PSol team to the International footprint, and that's really paying dividends in places like Europe and now Latin America. Our international telco vertical had 2 major wins in the quarter for a large U.K. telecommunications company. We were selected to deliver customized decisioning solutions for their mobile operations with our InterConnect platform. You might recall that deploying InterConnect globally has been a top priority for us over the last 4 or 5 years, another example that's gaining traction for us. And in Chile, we're delivering an ID management solution for a customer acquisition, which will lower their cost of acquisition in addition to some of their back-office expenses. Quickly on TDX. TDX continues to make really good progress. It's early days, only 6 months or so, but they're making very good progress. And strategically, we are very optimistic on the long-term fit for this company, not just in the current footprint, but in additional footprints as well. We've added a second large customer in Australia in the last couple of months and we're building a very robust pipeline of opportunities in Australia. In U.K., we continued to have significant contract wins in the pipeline we currently have, should enable TDX to deliver a very strong double-digit growth in 2015. Workforce Solutions is making a significant progress in diversifying its revenue. Through their suite deployment and income verification solutions, they are enabling deeper transparency for risk decisioning and their employer community, they have become an industry leader in providing employers with insights and capabilities to support their compliance activities. You've heard us talked about that, how Dann Adams and his team have brought data and analytics mindset and capabilities for not only the verifier side, but also the employer side. You've heard us talk about the CMA analytics in the past.  Some records for the Work Number database are up to just shy of 245 million records, and we now have over 3,700 companies contributing their employment and income information to that database. As you recall, our goal is not just to add the number of records, but also add more and more employers who contribute that data to us, and Dann has done a heck of a job on both fronts. We are lessening our dependence on mortgage activity in EWS. During the quarter, our non-mortgage product revenue grew a very strong 10%. Through new product innovation and diversification into new markets, our verifier revenue is now over 60% of Workforce Solutions revenue, up significantly from the 35% level in 2007, which is the time we acquired the company. And the value of an active record in the Work Number database now is up 94% since the acquisition of TALX in 2007. That comes through a lot of strong effort in our pricing team that comes through mix that comes through vertical market expansion diversification. So it's not just adding records to the database, but it's also the value of the record, and a combination of both those is pretty powerful financial model. Our focus on the government sector is progressing well due largely to our strong working relationship with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in support of the Affordable Care Act. We have identified a number of strong opportunities to assist them and other government agencies with employment and income verification, ID management and fraud solutions. I'm sure that everyone or many of you have read the Wall Street Journal articles earlier this week. We'll, during the Q&A, answer any questions you might have regarding the recent appellate court decisions. We are also uniquely positioned to help financial institutions meet their regulatory compliance obligations. Recently, a top 4 banks signed a contract to use our employment and income verification solution to meet CFPB requirements for their credit line, increasing offers -- increased offers. Workforce Solutions core non-mortgage market organic growth rates continue to be above their long-term range of 7% to 10%, so a strong execution in EWS. The current environment for our Personal Solutions segments continues to be challenging. As we thought in the past, the free market that has emerged. Growth in our transaction and part revenue has slowed, but the acquisition of TrustedID last year enables us to pursue a whole new set of indirect opportunities in the pipeline there for the indirect opportunity is as strong as we have seen in quite some time and gives us great hope that PSol will, in fact, turn -- return to their long-term growth model. We are currently developing new strategies to optimize the return on general marketing spend and plan to test the launch of these campaigns during the second half of 2014, early part of 2015. Assuming no change -- no significant changes to the regulatory environment, I am confident that the strategic path that Trey Loughran and PSol are on, that PSol will return to their upper-single-digit growth rates in 2015, and really leveraging the TrustedID indirect market opportunity, as well as our new strategic plan for the core business. Finally, North American Commercial Solutions. A few years ago, we shifted to a customer-centric model. We embarked upon what we called an enterprise-wide distribution marketing strategy to maximize our penetration of products and services into targeted market segments. USCIS was designated as the business unit responsible for executing strategic initiatives. They were the biggest, they had the most pipes and most customers. We first established our key client program with 4 of our largest customers. We now have 8 customers in KCP. We quickly followed that organizing our enterprise-wide marketing teams. We've targeted verticals like mortgage, auto, telco, utilities and insurance. This strategic initiative has contributed greatly to North American Commercial Solutions' historical growth and market share gains. The environment is changing and our customer relationships are now much broader and deeper. At the same time, our successful enterprise selling gives us tremendous opportunity to continue driving growth and market share gains for our commercial business. The next logical step in the evolution of our enterprise distribution strategy is to simplify the way our commercial customers interact with us, to allow us to accelerate growth and penetration. To accomplish this, we're going to consolidate the U.S. portion of the commercial business into USCIS, and the combined entity will be renamed USIS versus USCIS. The Canadian piece of commercial will go into international and leverage their strong relationship in Canada. As you will recall, it wasn't that many years ago, that was the structure for commercial. And to allow us to have a little bit more focus, to get more scale, which we have done, I broke it out as a direct report to me. So it's not going back to the old structure we used to have in the USCIS in Canada. We are as committed today as we have ever been to growing commercial, and I'm convinced now that we've incubated it for a few years, combining with International and USCIS will do just that. So in summary, all the business units are performing at a high level. Best practices regardless whether they originated or being leveraged across the organization. With depth of experience, our management team has enabled us easily move people and ideas across businesses. And while the individual business units will have difficult challenges from time to time, our portfolio of businesses could not be stronger or better positioned than we are today. We're now halfway through 2014 with 2 strong quarterly performance behind us. I'm proud of our team and how they've executed against their strategic initiatives, enabling us to overcome the mortgage headwinds in a much better shape than we anticipated when we entered the year. We built good foundation for continued growth in 2014 and beyond. And with that, John, officially welcome to your first earnings call with Equifax. I'd like you to kind of walk us through the financials, then we'll come back and do some Q&A. John W. Gamble: Great. Thanks, Rick, and I'm very excited to be joining the team and looking forward to a long and successful career. So as Rick already mentioned, we had some exciting opportunities in front of us. We're successfully maneuvering the headwinds and feel very good about our positioning and our various markets and the growth we should be able to deliver for ourselves, our customers and our shareholders. I'll be referring to the financial results from continuing operations generally presented on a GAAP basis. Now let me turn to the quarterly results. Rick already covered the total company financials, so I'll focus on the individual business units. Overall, U.S. Consumer Information Solutions came in a bit better than we expected. Revenue was $264 million, up 2% when compared to the second quarter of 2013. Online Consumer Information Solutions revenue was $191 million, up 4% when compared to the year-ago period and up 7% from the first quarter of 2014. Mortgage Solutions revenue of $28 million was down 15% compared to Q2 2013. This compares favorably to the Mortgage Bankers Application Index, which was down 52% in the second quarter. Consumer Financial Marketing Services revenue was $45 million, up 7% when compared to the year-ago quarter. The operating margin for U.S. Consumer Information Solutions was 41.5%, up from 40.2% in the second quarter of 2013. International revenue was $153 million, up 18% on a reported basis and up 23% on local currency basis. Acquisitions contributed approximately 17 points to the local currency growth. By region, Europe's revenue was $72 million, up 53% in U.S. dollars and up 40% in local currency, driven by the acquisition of TDX and mid-single-digit organic growth in our core business. Latin America's revenue was $48 million, down 1% in U.S. dollars, but up 19% in local currency, driven broadly by double-digit organic growth in consumer and commercial information solutions, decision solutions, analytical services and personal solutions. Canada Consumer revenue was $33 million, down 3% in U.S. dollars, but up 3% in local currency. As you know, our International margins have been impacted by the recent acquisitions. For the second quarter International's operating margin was 21.8%, up from 20.4% in the first quarter of 2014. As we indicated in our first quarter call, we expect to exit the year with an operating margin of over 25%. Workforce Solutions revenue was $119 million for the quarter, down 3% when compared to the second quarter of 2013. Verification Services, with revenue of $72 million, was down 6% when compared to the same quarter of 2013. Employer Services revenue was $47 million, up 1% compared to last year. And the Workforce Solutions operating margin was 33.9% compared to 31.1% in Q2 of 2013. North America Personal Solutions revenue was $54 million, up 5%. Growth was driven primarily by acquisition of TrustedID. Operating margin was 30.5% compared to 27.6% in Q2 2013, largely driven by reduced marketing expense in the quarter. North America Commercial Solutions revenue was $23 million, up 1% on a reported basis and up 3% on a local currency basis. Operating margin was 17.3% compared to 16.8% in the year-ago quarter. And I will turn it back to Rick. Richard F. Smith: Thanks, John. As we enter the third quarter, we are very encouraged by the various market opportunities we have for growth in each of the business units and continue to be very pleased with the execution of each of the BUs and COEs. While we still have a bit of mortgage headwind for the balance of the year, it has improved dramatically versus what we saw in the first half of the year. And as I've said before, the mortgage market is really unwinding very much like we had anticipated back when we gave guidance, early part of 2014. For the third quarter, some of the current exchange rates we'd expect the reported revenue will be between $620 million and $625 million. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $0.96 and $0.99 for the full year. We're still on the path to deliver our core organic non-mortgage market growth rate of 26% and 8%, and with the team's high level of execution and the opportunities we see before us, we are now in a position to increase our full year guidance. Assuming the current exchange rates, we should end the year with revenue between $2.440 billion and $2.465 billion, and adjusted EPS between $3.83 and $3.91. And I always said, versus our previous guidance of $3.75 to $3.89, and the current consensus of $3.83. With this full year guidance, our revenue growth accelerates from about 4% in the first half of 2014 to a level of about 9% to 12% in the second half of the year. And most importantly, that gives us really good momentum and confidence as we go into 2015. So with that, operator, if you would please open it up for any questions that they may have. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from George Mihalos with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : I wanted to start off, the USCIS again had another really strong quarter, revenues and margins certainly better than what we were looking for. Just curious, outside of auto, which has been hot for a while now, can you sort of call out another 2 or 3 end markets that you think are really sort of picking up steam recently? Richard F. Smith: Yes, it's markets and it's share gains. So -- and I mentioned a few of them in the call towards -- we have insurance sector, some nice wins there. In our online business, especially with our KCP accounts. If you recall, KCP has gone from 4 large banks to 8 very strategic accounts, including the 4 large banks. And then online business area continues to accelerate. We're gaining share there. We talked about an analytical win we had with the sandbox, one of the top 4 banks. Auto continues to be fantastic for us. So it is really, really broad-based that's giving us great growth there. And obviously, with that kind of growth in a high fixed cost business, all that margin falls to the bottom line. You've seen a great acceleration of margin there as well. Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : That's great color. And I just wanted to dig in a little bit on the guidance for the full year. You have sort of tightened the range around your revenue with a higher midpoint. Just curious relative to your expectations, what is outperforming from a revenue perspective versus what might be coming in a little bit lighter now that you've sort of updated that range? Richard F. Smith: Well, PSol will take another quarter or 2 to implement their new strategy and execute, what I mentioned on the call, the TrustedID indirect wins. So that softened a little bit with a little bit of headwind. A few countries in Central and South America have softened a bit. But then you're seeing stuff like the core organic non-mortgage market growth rate in EWS. I mentioned that growing over 10% for the second quarter in a row. That's things like collections, government, credit card, auto for them. We just walked through an array of different areas that are growing very strongly in USCIS. Europe is growing stronger than expected. Our core organic growth rate in places like Spain and the U.K., which still tend to be troubled economies, are delivering very, very solid organic growth rates. In fact, I think we mentioned we didn't -- the organic growth rates outside the U.S. are growing at 6% to 7% growth rate, and that's inclusive of some pretty tough economies. So that's a long answer to a very simple question. Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. Just last question from a modeling perspective. John, the corporate expense line has been down pretty considerably over the first half of '14, your general corporate expenses, what's driving that? And then how should we think about modeling that over the back half of the year? John W. Gamble: Yes. I believe the guidance we gave for the year was that corporate expenses would be up slightly. And I think that we still expect that to be the case. And I think what you're seeing really in the first half versus second half is really just timing mostly around investments. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Paul Ginocchio with Deutsche Bank. Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : I don't know if I missed it, but did you discuss online volumes in the consumer information systems? Richard F. Smith: Well, I'm sorry, Paul. What was your question? Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : So what were online volumes in the online consumer information services? Richard F. Smith: The OCIS volume was up 12% for the quarter. Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Great. And is the reason the differential between the volume growth and the revenue growth, is that still that higher value mortgage is down and that should reverse in the third quarter? Richard F. Smith: It's mixed largely. And mortgage is one piece of that. Customer mix could be another piece. Sometimes when you have large -- you have growth, as I mentioned, I think, just a second ago, in our very large strategic accounts, the pricing thresholds are different there than they would be for other customers. So just think of it generically as mix. Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. And then in the second half, does that mix improved from where it is today? Richard F. Smith: I would not expect it to change dramatically. Operator : Next, we will hear from David Togut with Evercore. David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : If you could dig into the International margin outlook a little bit, if you addressed this initially, I apologize. I was joining from another call, but what should we expect from International now that TDX is fully integrated? Richard F. Smith: Yes. One, I'm not sure when you joined. But TDX, as I mentioned on the call, if you've missed it, is coming along very nicely. We continue to integrate it successfully. We're getting great wins in our current footprint like Australia and the U.K. and we're very encouraged we have the ability to bring it to other markets like U.S., Canada and into South America. As far as margin goes, we had mentioned at the time of the acquisition, there would be a drag as we get TDX up and running on the margin for the first half of the year. And as we exit the year, we expect to fully [ph] be back to the historical range of around 25% or so for International. So we're very much on track with that. John had reiterated that in his comments as well. So from a strategic perspective, financial perspective and margin perspective, TDX and International are on the direction we had guided back in the first quarter. David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : Got it. And just as a follow-up, could you give us your updated thoughts on capital allocation? And in particular, any thoughts about a potential 2015 dividend increase? Richard F. Smith: Yes. I'll take a crack at it. John, if you want to jump in, you can add to it as well. Our dividend policy that David was -- established a few years ago, we remain committed to that and actually gives back 25% to 35% of our net income in the form of the dividends. So obviously, as net income rises, the dividend will increase. I don't anticipate changing that financial model, 25% to 35%. As I think overall, that capital structure outside of dividend, and we've been fairly light in our share repurchase in the first half of the year. You should expect us to increase, at a pretty significant rate, the share repurchase in the back half of this year. John W. Gamble: But our leverage at this point in time is fairly low, right? Yes. Richard F. Smith: Good point. And our leverage is 1.8, 1.9. John W. Gamble: 1.8, yes. Operator : Next, we'll hear from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : I want to come back to that International margin again a little bit. What are the trigger points that are going to get you guys back to this 25%? I think, originally, I'd always assumed that you were going to do some, I think, fairly reasonable amount of investments to take TDX into those other markets. And I'm wondering has that changed at all, or is that TDX running ahead of budget on the revenue side. Just it's a pretty big, I guess, jump to get to the 25% kind of run rate as we exit the year. Richard F. Smith: No, it's pretty straightforward. Just the leverage you get as it -- business continues to grow and get the revenue stream, it tends to be more backend loaded, and TDX backend loaded than front end loaded, so you get some leverage there. We'll get the operational synergies you expect. But let me clarify a point, Dan. The cost to take the solutions -- the suite of solutions that we have with TDX into additional countries is very, very, very cost efficient. You can do it because the data, the solutions are housed in the U.K. So when you go to Spain, when you go to Columbia, when you go to Australia, you can literally do that with a salesperson or 2 or maybe you outsource it to a value-added reseller, so that the cost of implementation is very, very low. Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay. It sounds like the analytical sandbox has moved kind of passed this beta testing idea, and you're even calling out as one of the -- I guess one of the growth drivers you saw in USCIS. And so I wanted to spend a second on a little bit the revenue model. You talked about the first stage as kind of setting up this enterprise-wide decisioning, but then you talk about selling the new products and capabilities. I'm just trying to get a sense of kind of how that revenue model builds out. One sounds like you've got greater visibility than the other end. And the other one sounds like you might have an upfront piece of revenue. So if you could just parse that, that would be great. Richard F. Smith: Yes, there is 2 things to think about. One is we continue to add different players stand up, being able to sandbox with them, so we get paid for that, just like we have with other banks in the past. We're starting to do this, not just in the U.S., but outside the U.S. as well. Secondly, as I mentioned, one of the top 4 banks when you stand that up, we get their teams and our teams in there looking at the combined data assets and start hypothesizing about products and solutions. So what that's resulted in now is a series of batch projects and analytics that we've done for these banks and they pay us for that. So it's -- financially think about it is offline batch revenue, and it's really analytics and solutions that we're providing with the unique data assets. Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then just the last question I have. Are you -- across the demand environment for the consumer spectrum, primarily in the United States, are you seeing any change or I should say broadening of the spectrum relative to kind of the affluent consumer relative to the non-affluent consumer? Richard F. Smith: Thanks, Dan. I'd say, overall, we're seeing -- I think your question was specifically the U.S., we're not seeing a whole lot of change in the U.S. dynamics for the consumer with the exception of 2 areas and one we've highlighted in the past, and that is the automotive market. Banks are aggressive in the automotive market, consumers, the age of the cars. The age -- I think some of the oldest levels in the history of our country. So that's obviously a high demand area for us. The other thing we're seeing, I'm not sure it really ties, affluent versus non-affluent, that is with inventory of homes coming down, prices going up. The demand for loans against their homes, so home equity loans is starting to rise for the first time in quite some time. And our forecast anticipates that will continue to accelerate to the back end of this year and clearly, through 2015. Hopefully that helps. Operator : Next, we'll hear from Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs. Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : One question to follow up on the last one. With some of the conversation around potential banks getting more aggressive than the \"subprime market,\" I was wondering, do you see any outsized contribution to growth from customers that are evaluating say, subprime product customers versus, say, a more affluent customer? Do they buy more reports? Do they spend more money on monitoring or is the revenue opportunity there pretty similar? Richard F. Smith: Yes, I think we're fairly agnostic to this segment. With the -- as they go down subprime, I'm thinking of automotive and we talked that last time we talked about a thing called a superscore, as they go down to subprime, they're more inclined to ask a few more questions. So they are more likely to pull a verification of employment, a verification of income. If someone was walking in and has the score of 780, 800, this is excluding mortgage, they may or may not pull VOE/VOI. But clearly, as the markets go down, market -- their appetite for verification of income and employment goes up. They may also leverage things like our CSD, what we used to call NC+ [ph] or our -- which helps them PIN-file [ph]. So if they're not really credit active, they'll pull the file to see how they paid off the utilities and telco obligations in the past. So if there's upside Andre, it's really in those areas of VOE/VOI and CSD. Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : And I know you don't control the pace here and you see a lot of the same headlines we do, but I was just wondering if you can give some color on how the Verification Service is used for the onboarding process where public exchange is going, and how much that's currently contributing to verification revenue to date. Richard F. Smith: Yes, sure. It's -- we've kind of framed up in the past, is it's above the minimum annual obligated threshold app that we have with CMS. All the trials that the government had rolling out was an initiative we obviously felt as well. There are some really exciting things going on with that right now. One we've talked about on the last earnings call is to help our employers show they're compliant with the Affordable Care Act. We're deploying analytics to those customers and we're charging for that. We've got a-- we've closed over 100 deals and a very, very strong pipeline on top of that. Secondly, as we deploy those analytics, we're getting more records added, and that's adding significantly to the Work Number database. And then third, as you know, in November, I think it's the 15th, is the next period for enrollment. So we expect to see some uptick then. You've seen, and I alluded to in my opening comments, there were 2 appellate court rulings a week or so ago and maybe even this week. A lot of noise there. Who knows where that goes, but we're no smarter there than you guys are at this point in time. But our instinct is that they probably solve this in a proper way between now and then, and there's little impact. But time will tell there. Operator : Next, we will hear from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Unknown Analyst : This is Louis Pavi [ph] stepping in for Andrew Steinerman this morning. So we heard Rick mention a couple of times that Equifax is helping clients more with prospecting, and we recall that Alliance Data bought the Direct Marketing Services division in 2010, and so is there a return to that type of business, and maybe with a little bit different approach this time? Richard F. Smith: No, no. I mean, that was a great transaction for us, and it's in the right hand with the right owner. And yes, and our team are doing a great job with that platform we used to call DMS. That was not a core competency of ours. Our whole focus is to leverage our analytics, leverage our unique data assets to help our customers like ADS and like in banks be smarter in prospecting and growing their business. That's a win for us, that's a win for them -- for us. Don't expect us to get back in that business. Unknown Analyst : Okay, great. And one more question, just it's obvious that Equifax is very excited about the TDX acquisition, and that's doing great. Can you talk a little bit more about the broader strategy in the collections space? Richard F. Smith: Yes, that's a great one. We are equally as excited about this platform we bought in Mexico, Inffinix. In fact, we get [ph] smarter every day. Our initial thought when we bought both those companies was, one, it gave us capabilities we had to have for our current customers. It was a need they had that was being unfulfilled. It -- we also thought about TDX as being a platform that was for the larger, more sophisticated customers and countries. And in Inffinix would be a stronger fit for the developing countries like Central and South America. As we get smarter about both assets, we see kind of some combining of the 2 platforms, broadening the entire continuum of capabilities and collections as opposed to bifurcating them by sophistication of markets. So we're very, very hopeful that, not only will these businesses grow in the current footprint that they operate in, but we'll bring them to our broader footprint that Equifax operates in and eventually, into new countries where we don't operate at all. It's a very cost-effective way, I mentioned earlier, to get into new geographies, if you solve problems for customers, learn about the marketplace, and then expand our analyst capability beyond collections. Operator : Moving on, we'll hear from Manav Patnaik. Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Research Division : This is actually Greg calling in for Manav. The margins for us were the biggest surprise, and I was wondering if you could help us sort of bridge the gap for the second half of the year. You've got the TDX benefit, so you should see higher margins in International. But I was wondering if there are any unique seasonal factors that we should consider for the second half of the year. Richard F. Smith: The only thing -- I wouldn't say it's really seasonal, but John alluded to it and it impacts margins is that on the corporate expense line, we do have some investments we'll be making in the second half of the year. And remember, our investments tend to be largely around capital for new products and technology to grow. So you should see a step-up there, as John alluded to, that obviously impacts margin. But in general terms, what we should expect is -- we are committed to our long-term margin model, what we talked to guys about that. And that is every year growing 25 basis points or so on the margin, and we've done that for quite some time. We plan to continue this still going forward. Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. And then I guess the commercial and bringing it into the consumer businesses. I was wondering if there is any change in strategy there. Are they -- are you looking for additional cross-sell opportunities between the business lines, and what the thought process was there? Richard F. Smith: Yes. Good question, Greg. So if you go back -- I can't recall exactly what year it was, but when broke out commercial into a North America unit reporting to me, it was to get me closer to the business, understand the business, take a very small business, incubate it and grow it. And I'm always convinced that, at that time, it needed more direct attention, and we did that and we grew it more successful. Then a couple of years ago, maybe 2 years ago, we launched this thing called enterprise selling, which is maximizing our interaction with our good customers in the U.S. and using the pipes and resources of, at the time, Dann Adams -- excuse me, Rudy Ploder. Rudy Ploder's leadership and his team in the U.S., and sell all of our products. They would sell a verification of employment income, the USCIS products and the commercial products. That has gained great traction in the last couple of years. And it became very obvious that the next up is just to make that organizationally a direct report into Rudy's team. Give all the attention it requires. It's been incubated, it's gaining traction. So it was just the natural thing to do to help minimize the confusion for our customers, minimize the inefficiencies we may have organizationally as well. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Did you guys say plus 9% core organic x mortgage constant currency? Richard F. Smith: No. I think I said in my very opening comment, it was 9% growth, including acquisitions. Constant currency, is that right, Jeff? I don't know -- yes, the core organic non-mortgage market growth rate for the quarter was very much like the first quarter, mid-6% range. Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. And then, Rick, if I'm hearing you correctly, it sounds like you're naming more wins, larger wins and a relatively good pipeline versus what I -- how I remember you describing it in the past. Am I hearing you correctly? And if so, what's driving it? Is there something in the end market, whether it'd be competitor disruption or improvement in some of the end markets or is this really all about Equifax execution? Richard F. Smith: I think it's a continuous story. Something we've been talking about for quite some time. And you're hearing me talking about some larger wins, but we've been building this for quite some time. It's really leveraging the unique data assets we've tried to build out since 2007. It's about the analytics capability drive off of those unique data assets. It's about NPI. So all the things we've been doing. And what you're seeing is the team is executing at extremely high levels, and I've said this a few times. It's probably the highest levels I've seen since I've been here. And when you put that all together, it's making a difference in the marketplace. Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. And then just finally on PSol, it seems like the free [ph] options are here to stay, but you sound pretty confident about getting some reacceleration next year, so maybe a little bit more on the PSol strategy? Richard F. Smith: Yes. One, Trey is a solid leader, and he's done a very good job of understanding the current environment which we're in, adapting to the current environment for fleets. And I think short-term, he's done a really good job of maximizing the profit coming out of PSol, while he takes the ship and kind of redirects it. And when he redirects it, we'll go back to higher levels of growth. That's number one. And I've been through his strategy. I agree with his strategy. It's thoughtful and it will be effective and I think we'll start to see that as we exit this year and get into 2015. Secondly, we bought a really good franchise in a marketplace or the market segment that we had largely ignored in my time here in the indirect market, and we bought this company called TrustedID. And Scott Mitic who runs that, found that business, he and his team out there, running others have built a remarkable pipeline on the indirect side and that just takes time. So yes, the company -- takes time that once you get a pipeline built to close it and get the revenue, but that is coming, and it's coming strongly. So the combination of kind of taking the old, what we call kind of PSol east, getting this new strategy up and running and are leveraging indirect model. The combination of those 2 things gives me new confidence that we'll get back to the upper-single-digit growth rates next year and beyond. And then there's a big unknown out there. And I used that in my comments as it relates to PSol, and that is, where does the regulatory landscape, how does it evolves over the coming years? So assuming it evolves, as we are hopeful that it will, I think PSol's upper single-digit growth strategy, we talked about for long-term, is very, very realistic. Operator : We'll now hear from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : The -- on the commercial side of the business, that's been -- the growth area has been below average compared to the corporate average. Can you talked a little bit about what's driving that in terms of how much of it's macro or how much of it is competition, and how the new structure actually addresses that? Richard F. Smith: Yes, I think it's, to be honest, it's always a combination of both. I think it's the small business lending, is starting to heal, but it's not real strong yet. And if you look at the transcripts from any of the banks, they would reiterate that. There is always some element of execution that we've got to look at ourselves in the mirror and say are we executing at the highest level possible. And so I think it's a combination both those there. I do think by taking down an organizational wall and making it more fluid by having Rudy and USCIS directly own that product capability for the customers in the U.S. will help, and same thing I think that when you get Carol Gray and Paulino Barros in Canada, and you take that artificial wall down of reporting and have unadulterated access to that, that should help in Canada as well. William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And on the M&A side, if you could comment on the volume and the attractiveness of potential targets you're looking at these days. Richard F. Smith: Yes. I'd say we just concluded our 3-year strategic plan, Bill, and M&A is tied to strategy obviously. And the pipeline continues to center around fraud and ID, analytics and tuck-ins, geographical expansion. I don't see, at this juncture, a need to do any large transformational deals by any means. We're still committed to our model of 1 to 2 points of revenue growth coming from acquisitions over an extended period of time, so I think that still holds true today. Operator : We have one additional question left in the queue. We'll hear from Brett Huff with Stephens. Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Somebody had a couple of questions around the USCIS and kind of what was driving that, and you outlined some of that. I'm going to ask again that question and just see if you'll comment on any uptick you all are seeing in card mailings, specifically because I don't think I heard you mention that. We've heard from a couple of people, one of your competitors. And then one of the issuing processors saying that they're seeing an improvement in mailings, maybe not to prime folks, not to subprime but kind of somewhere in the middle. Are you seeing any of that at all or any comments on that? Richard F. Smith: Yes, I'd say. And it shows up in our marketing numbers. I would not describe it as overly robust now. It is definitely picking up sequentially, it's picking up year-over-year, but I'd describe it. And as I talk to CEOs of banks and card issuers and talk to our teams, it's still very early days. They're still very, very cautious in getting back into a more aggressive broad-based lower credit score card issuance strategy at this juncture. So yes, it's picking up a bit, Brett, but it's still just sluggish. Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then the second question is a little bit bigger picture. It seems like you've got a lot of levers you can pull as usual for rev growth and it sounds like your enterprise sales effort has been very effective, but you're always investing in new products. Which of those 2 levers, sort of the cross sale, if you will, or the new products do you see sort of the most upside here in the next year or so? Richard F. Smith: Well, I think as I think about levers for organic growth, I think about NPI continuing to be -- it's a huge part of our DNA, it's a been a big part of our success for the past 7 years. That will continue to be. Secondly is verticalization. We've been at that now for a couple of years around the world. And we have identified the key verticals that are important for us, and we're actively and aggressively going after those in every geography of the world, and that's enabled us to gain share and win. And it's not just share gain, but it is -- because of our unique data assets that we have, Brett, it's enabling us to get customers to spend more money on solutions that they wouldn't have otherwise spent. And our competitors, at this juncture, don't have the ability to offer the same solution. So a combination of all 3 of those. Operator : We have no questions left in the queue. I'll turn the call back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks. Jeffrey L. Dodge: Thanks, operator. Appreciate everybody's time and interest and support of Equifax. And with that, we will conclude the call. Thanks, everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

Volshteyn - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division George Gregory - Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2014 Equifax Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Dodge. Please go ahead, sir. Jeffrey L. Dodge: Thanks, and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Jeff Dodge, Investor Relations, and with me today are Rick Smith, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com. During this call, we'll be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in the filings with the SEC, including our 2013 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. We will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted operating margin. It will be adjusted for certain items, which affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance. Adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes acquisition-related amortization expense and the associated tax effects, in addition to the impact of a settlement of a legal dispute over certain software license agreements. Adjusted operating margin excludes the legal settlement regarding the dispute over software license agreements. These measures are detailed in our non-GAAP reconciliation tables included with our earnings release and also posted on our website.

Now I'd like to turn it over to Rick. Richard F. Smith: Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us again this morning for the third quarter earnings call. The team delivered a solid performance again in the third quarter as they continue to execute on our growth strategy and our operational excellence priorities. We continue to improve our NPI process, sharpen our focus on delivering solutions that leverage our multiple data assets and sophisticated analytics expertise. Customer demand for our Decision 360 offerings continues to be high, and I'll go through some examples of those when I jump into the USIS highlights in a few moments. LEAN is also making important contributions to our initiatives, both revenue and expense. This year, we have 10 enterprise growth initiatives that are being managed using our process improvement and measurement tools that we've developed, and we've talked to you about those in the past. High-level financial overview for the quarter. The total revenue was $613 million, up 7% on a reported basis and up 8% on a local currency basis from the third quarter of 2013 and in line with our expectations when you take into consideration a much stronger dollar. In the quarter, FX created a $6 million year-over-year headwind, something we had not anticipated nor had much of the country anticipated when we gave guidance last quarter. When you exclude the mortgage market headwinds and you include acquisitions, revenue grew 10% in local currency and 9% in U.S. dollars. The adjusted operating margin was 26.4%, up from 26.2% a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $1.01, up 12% from $0.90 last year and up versus our guidance of $0.96 to $0.99 for the quarter. U.S. mortgage market is really unfolding much as we anticipated earlier this year. As we enter fourth quarter and 2015, those headwinds do abate. Even with the many global uncertainties we face, I remain optimistic about our growth prospects, not just for 2014 but also for 2015. I'll give you some texture around that before we go to questions and answers. Here's a few highlights by business unit I typically give you and I'll go through some of those, and then John will take over and give you some of the financial details. USIS continues to drive growth through its enterprise-wide sales channels as well as capitalizing on several strategic initiatives. During the quarter, we signed a multiyear, multimillion dollar agreement to provide online ID proofing services for the Social Security Administration. This is a great win as it further establishes Equifax as an important service provider, enabling the Social Security Administration to provide consumers with access to their information in a secure online environment. Our initiatives in auto, retail banking, insurance and telco, in addition to new initiatives in mortgage, are driving solid mid-single-digit organic growth for USIS. Year-to-date core non-mortgage market growth is performing as we have expected and talked to you about in the past. We continue to find strong market demand for super scores. We've talked about super scores before with you. That's where we take combined -- we combine different data assets, including our data assets, third-party data assets, to create a unique decisioning solution for our customers. This is a great example of leveraging D360 to fuel new areas of growth. As you know, in this area, our customers need to grow but also need to control their risks, and many times, their best opportunities for growth are typically with younger consumers who have limited credit history. With the credit database only, hit rates and risk assessment on younger consumers is generally very low due typically to a limited amount of credit history. By augmenting the available credit information with these additional data assets and sophisticated analytics, we can improve the risk assessment with a single scoring solution for both financial and nonfinancial customers, and this has been very, very well received by the auto vertical in the past few months. Our Identity and Fraud Solutions continue to add strong organic growth within USIS. Leveraging our strong partnership with the centers for Medicaid and Medicare services, we have secured another multimillion dollar opportunity for monitoring Medicare and Medicaid providers. Really, that whole opportunity was opened up with the relationship that EWS has created in the last 18 months with CMS. And with major credit card companies within USIS, we won a cloud-based ID authentication solution. During the quarter, we also signed a 2-year multimillion dollar agreement with an indirect reseller in the direct-to-consumer market. This is one of the largest deals we've signed of this type, with annual revenues exceeding $20 million. For 2014, we expect USIS to deliver core non-mortgage market organic growth rate consistent with our long-term growth rates that we've talked to you about in the past. Moving on to International. They continue to leverage NPI and their key strategic initiative is to drive growth and to drive deeper market penetration. Total revenue in International was a bit lighter than we expected this quarter, driven primarily by a stronger dollar that I mentioned early on and the fact that the revenue ramp in TDX is now moving into early 2015. Maybe I'll just pause there for a moment and talk about TDX. TDX is a great strategic asset for us. It's performing very well. I'm as bullish today as I was when we bought the asset back in the early part of this year. But we're just getting used to the forecasting model for TDX, and we missed that by about a quarter or so, so we will accelerate its growth in 2015. We've also identified a number of attractive opportunities, which are expected to contribute to strong organic growth in 2015, not just in TDX's current footprint, but also our ability to take that asset to the U.S., Canada and other geographies. And I'll be more than happy to talk about that in the Q&A and any questions you might have. In Canada, our recent innovation for data breach services has become a great success. During the quarter, we signed 2 1-year contracts that are expected to contribute over $4 million in revenue. Based on the initial success we've had with this new product in Canada, we're developing a strategy to expand the service to other geographic markets. We're also making great progress in penetrating the telecommunications market in Latin America. In Peru, we recently signed a 2-year multimillion dollar contract for a wide range of services, including our InterConnect decisioning platform, fraud screening platform, analytical and marketing services, ID verification, new account application support and collection services, so a broad array of products to a -- customers we know very, very well in the telecommunications arena. Through partnerships in NPI, Workforce Solutions continues to find opportunities to grow the available records in the Work Number database. We're well on our way to achieving our short-term target of 250 million records and have already identified additional opportunities for records, which will enable us to exceed this goal. Total records for the Work Number database are now at 248.6 million records. We now have over 4,000 companies contributing their employment and income information into our database. Dann and his team continue to do a very, very good job there. Our analytical dashboard that supports companies' compliance management requirements under the Affordable Care Act has been very successful, and we've talked about that in the past with you. We are significantly ahead of our targets for revenue and for record contribution to the Work Number database in 2014, with over 215 clients signing up for this service. And again, in many cases, they're not only buying the analytics, but they're giving us the Work Number database as well, so it's a double win. We continue to deliver solid double-digit growth in our targeted non-mortgage verticals, particularly auto, card and home equity lending within EWS. As our higher margin verify revenue growth outpaces the employer services growth, operating margins in Workforce Solutions continue to expand nicely. During the quarter, in EWS, we have signed another contract with a major credit card company for verification of income to be incorporated into their credit line increase program. You've heard us talk about that in the past. That solution for credit line increases continues to gain great traction for EWS. We've been experiencing increasing interest in our verification of income services as lenders continue to seek better solutions to further strengthen their underwriting policies. Workforce Solutions' core non-mortgage market organic growth continues to be well above their long-term targeted growth range of 7% to 9%. PSol is executing well on its core business initiatives, while making good progress on its strategic transformation. In the core business, they're ahead of their targets for churn and customer lifetime value, in addition to a year-over-year increase in ARPU, which has enabled them to deliver strong organic growth and operating margins. In the indirect market, we've signed a number of new contracts and have launched a few beta tests for some very large prospects. The pipeline is robust on the indirect side, and we believe that the team's efforts will successfully reposition PSol for good growth in 2015. Business unit leaders have accomplished a lot this year, offsetting mortgage market headwinds, tackling change in market dynamics, integrating acquisitions and positioning their businesses for continued growth and margin expansion. We're now through the toughest part of the mortgage headwinds. Looking forward to the fourth quarter and beyond, we fully expect our non-mortgage products and services to continue delivering top line growth, consistent with our long-term business model of 7% to 10%. And with that, John, the financials, please. John W. Gamble: Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As Rick mentioned, our performance this quarter was strong. A lot of hard work had to be accomplished, but everyone contributed to the effort. As before, I'll be referring to the financial results from continuing operations generally presented on a GAAP basis. It is important to highlight that FX became a greater headwind during the quarter than we had originally expected for the quarter. Our financial performance was adversely impacted by the accelerated depreciation of currencies versus the U.S. dollar. For the quarter, compared to the third quarter of 2013, revenues were negatively impacted by approximately $6 million, and adjusted EPS was negatively impacted by about $0.02 a share. Due to a number of discrete items, our lower tax rate benefited adjusted EPS by approximately $0.03 a share. Netting the tax benefit with a negative impact of FX results in a $0.01 contribution to our reported adjusted EPS of $1.01. Earlier this year, we indicated that our stock buyback should accelerate over the course of the year, and we expected to exit 2014 with a lower share count. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for $113 million, and share repurchases will continue into the fourth quarter. Now let me turn to the business units' financial performance. U.S. Information Solutions revenue was $279 million, up 3% when compared to the third quarter of 2013. Online Information Solutions revenue was $206 million, up 4% when compared to the year-ago period. Mortgage Solutions revenue of $28 million was flat compared to Q3 2013. This compares favorably to the Mortgage Bankers Application Index, which was down 26% in the third quarter. Financial Marketing Services revenue was $45 million, up 2% when compared to the year-ago quarter. The adjusted operating margin for U.S. Information Solutions was 40.3%, up from 36.2% in the third quarter of 2013. This reflects positive product mix as well as good expense control. International's revenue was $158 million, up 18% on a reported basis and up 22% on a local currency basis. Acquisitions contributed approximately 16 points of the local currency growth. By region, Europe's revenue was $70 million, up 51% in U.S. dollars and up 40% in local currency, driven by the acquisition of TDX and mid-single-digit organic growth in our core business. Latin America's revenue was $49 million, flat in U.S. dollars, but up 18% in local currency, driven by double-digit organic growth in decision solutions, analytical services and Personal Solutions. Canada revenue was $39 million, flat in U.S. dollars, but up 5% in local currency. For the third quarter, International's operating margin was 23.5%, up from 22.5% in the second quarter of 2014. Workforce Solutions' revenue was $122 million for the quarter, up 6% when compared to the third quarter of 2013. Verification Services, with revenue of $76 million, was up 10% when compared to the same quarter of 2013. Employer Services revenue was $47 million, up 1% compared to last year. The Workforce Solutions operating margin was 32.5% compared to 29.9% in Q3 of 2013. North America Personal Solutions revenue was $54 million, up 3%. Growth was driven primarily by Canadian subscription and indirect revenue primarily through TrustedID. Operating margin was 31.6% compared to 26.3% in Q3 2013, largely driven by reduced marketing expense in the quarter. Finally, our general corporate expense was up this quarter from the year-ago period due to increased incentive compensation and timing of some investments. 2014 year-to-date, general corporate expense is up only less than 1%. Now let me turn it back to Rick. Richard F. Smith: Thanks, John. As we enter the fourth quarter, we're ending this year pretty much as we anticipated at the start of the year. The mortgage headwinds are largely behind us, really abating in mid-third quarter. We've got a number of opportunities on the horizon that will continue to drive both top and bottom line growth. For the fourth quarter, assuming current exchange rates, we expect reported revenue to be between $615 million and $620 million and adjusted EPS to be between $0.99 and $1.03. This assumes an FX headwind of approximately $11 million on revenue and $0.02 to $0.03 on adjusted EPS. Also, as I mentioned earlier, the anticipated revenue contribution from TDX accelerates as we go into 2015 versus the year-end 2014 that we originally thought when we gave guidance at the end of the second quarter. So for the full year of 2014, we expect EPS to finish in the range of $3.86 to $3.96 -- $3.90 versus our prior guidance on our last call of $3.83 to $3.91. At this time, our optimistic outlook for 2015 has not changed. We expect the mortgage market to return to a more normal mix of home purchases, refinancing activity and the increase in home equity lending. We also believe that our strategic initiatives outside of the mortgage market will continue delivering revenue and earnings growth consistent with our long-term business model. Our confidence is supported, first and foremost, by broad-based execution across all of our businesses throughout 2013 and '14, where the swings of the mortgage market were their greatest. In addition, our core non-mortgage market organic growth rate continues to be in the targeted range of 6% to 8%. Finally, the integration of our strategic acquisitions made in 2014 will contribute to organic growth in 2015. All these are -- while we are not without challenges, this team has demonstrated their ability to continue to deliver on our commitments to our shareholders. So with that, we'd love to, operator, turn it over to questions. If you'd please open up to our callers. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll go to our first question from George Mihalos of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Wanted to start off on TDX. Just maybe, John, specifically, can you call out the revenue contribution from TDX in the quarter, how you're thinking about that for '14? And then as we -- or for fourth quarter, I should say. And then if I'm not mistaken, the growth profile of that business was somewhere around, I think you guys were talking about it being somewhere around 20%. Has anything changed there as you look out over the long term? Richard F. Smith: George, this is Rick. I'm not sure if you asked the question to myself or of John, but let me see if I can tackle that. We do break out that it's 16% of the local currency International growth. TDX is a great asset and I said that earlier. I'm as convinced it's a great asset today as I was then. What we learned is the forecasting model from the time you actually engage a client to the time you sign a contract and then get the revenue is a little longer than we anticipated. So revenue we had originally forecasted when we bought the business, I think it was in January of this year, by the time we get our heads around it and build a forecasting model in late first quarter, it's turned out to be a little slower than we had anticipated. But in the current footprint, it is going to be a great asset for us and in new footprint, i.e. Canada, U.S. and Latin America. And more importantly, the combination of Inffinix, which we bought in Mexico City, with now TDX is already starting to generate some strong interest in new geographies. So hopefully, that helps. Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. So just a timing issue, nothing else? Richard F. Smith: Correct. Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. And just shifting gears a little bit to USIS. Again, the contribution margin or, I should say, sort of the incremental EBIT year-over-year continues to be growing at a rate that is higher than revenue growth. Can you maybe talk about that a little bit? What's driving that? And how should we be thinking about that going forward? Richard F. Smith: Yes, John alluded to that a little bit in his commentary there. It has to do with mix of products within OSIS -- OCIS and it's just that our core online credit product is -- which has huge margins, as you know, and very large incremental margin, is growing at a faster rate than overall USCIS -- or USIS. Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay, great. And maybe I'll sneak one last one in. Just in terms of PSol, you're talking about the business changing a little bit there. Are you comfortable with PSol being able to grow in 2015, just given some of the changes you're making there? Richard F. Smith: Absolutely, George. And I mentioned that in our last call that Trey and his team have done a great job of kind of identifying there's a new world out there in this free market, and there's 3 pillars to his growth. One is to maximize the growth potential and larger potential in its core business. Two, is to take this asset we bought, god, I think it was a year ago, called TrustedID, which is the indirect market, and grow that at significant rates and he's doing that. The pipeline, as I mentioned in my comments, is really, really strong. Pipeline of -- and have closed some of those deals as well. And the pipeline for revenue in fourth quarter and next year remains very, very strong. The third lever is he's got to figure out a way to not -- to play in the free market and he's doing that as well. So I mentioned, I think it was in the second quarter call, George, that those guys have done a great job over the last, I think, 2 years of growing beyond our long-term growth model. We talked about them being upper single digits growth model, and they've been growing it double digit. And I mentioned on the call -- in the second quarter call that, yes, I'm convinced that these guys will get back to their long-term growth model next year. Operator : Our next question will come from Manav Patnaik of Barclays. Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Research Division : This is actually Greg stepping in for Manav. Just following up on PSol. You talked about TrustedID as the way to go after the indirect space. Could you also provide some color on the strategy in that remaining direct-to-consumer space and what you're doing there? Richard F. Smith: Yes. So again, it's -- as how [ph] I answered for George, 3 pillars of growth. One is to continue to just maximize your growth by minimizing churn, maximizing ARPU, continue to launch new products in the old core business. Things he's done very, very well now for whatever it's been, 4, 5 years. Just continue that and that will yield growth for us. That's going to be, as I talked about before, in the lower single digit growth rates. You then couple that with TrustedID growing at strong double-digit growth rates and then finding a way to play in the free market. You aggregate those 3 together and you get a strong upper single digit growth rate. Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. And then I know commercial is now wrapped back into USIS and International, but can you talk about how those offerings have been performing? And is that still a market segment? Or you think you can get that high single digit growth? Richard F. Smith: We gave you in the press release historical figures for commercial and you can kind of work with those and build some models. We're not going to break that out going forward. It's a very, very small part of our business, as you know, but it still remains important for us. Yes, I'm convinced it's a growth business as a part of USIS. And then the main reason I put it back into USCIS was that most of the business comes with what we call KCP or large clients and USCIS had those relationships. So I'm convinced taking the product offerings we have with the pipes that we have in USCIS will yield good growth going forward, yes. Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Research Division : And consolidating that commercial business into International, just to check, doesn't have any impact on the 25% margin that you expect for International ending the year? Richard F. Smith: Haven't done that calculation. No. The answer is, no. I'm being told no. It's very small. It's very small in the scheme of things. Operator : And we'll move on to our next question from David Togut of Evercore. David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : Could you dig into the underlying unit growth and unit pricing trends year-over-year that you saw in OLCIS? Richard F. Smith: You're looking for volume or for price or both? David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : Both volume and price, if you have it. Richard F. Smith: Okay. I don't have it. Do you have that, Jeff? Give us a second, David. I don't have that at my fingertips. David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : Okay. Let me shift to the next question then. Mortgage has been a headwind for the past year or so, but rates on the 10-year Treasury have been dropping very sharply over the last few months. Is there a case to be made that mortgage actually could once again become a growth driver in 2015? Richard F. Smith: Yes, I think there's a case. It's a convergence of a couple of different things. I think, obviously, it's unemployment moving down, home prices going up. The 10-year which the mortgage rates are based upon continue to stay at these historically low rates. There's also, I think, David, you probably read, a lot of discussion right now in D.C. about changing the regulation, driven by Fannie and Freddie, on the underwriting standards that the banks would have to adhere to. If they loosen those standards, it potentially opens up, obviously, a larger population of credit risk to the mortgage market. So keep your eye on that, too. If that happens, that's obviously a potential good catalyst for us. The other thing we're seeing already, and I think it's -- speak from memory, but there's an uptick in home equity lending, which has been virtually nonexistent since the recession. And I think in the third quarter it grew something like 21%. So it's still very low numbers compared to historical standards of the total volume, but that should be an uptick for us going forward as well. David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : Just final question for me. Can you give us a sense of consumer credit demand by major geographies served? How you see that evolving over the next 12 to 18 months? Richard F. Smith: Yes. Let's think about that. So in Latin America, if that's what you're referring to, if you're referring to the International footprint versus just USIS, David? Is that correct? David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : Yes. Richard F. Smith: Yes. Latin America is still immature so -- in the use of credit products, so it's continued to expand and continue to grow even though we're reading about things like recessions and instability in some governments like Argentina. So I continue to see medium-term and long-term growth prospects in the Latin America region to be strong. In the U.S., it really depends on the credit spectrum and the verticals. You heard us talk about in the past, automotive continues to be strong in the use of credit and the growth in credit. Just mentioned 21% growth in home equity lending in the third quarter. I think that's going to be strong for us. I think you're going to see a switch from headwinds in mortgage to growth next year. The credit card lending business is starting to see some signs of growth in the U.S., which is encouraging as well. Canada, I'd describe as stable. U.K., I'd describe as stable to some good growth. And I'd describe Spain, even though we continue to do a good job in Spain, as a troubled economy right now. Hopefully, that helps. David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : Got it. Should I follow-up with John on the unit numbers after the call? Richard F. Smith: Please do. No, David, I got it here now. Yes, the volume was up 14% in the quarter, and the unit price was down approximately 5%. David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : And that was just mix shift? Richard F. Smith: Correct. Operator : And we'll move on to our next question from Dan Perlin of RBC Capital Markets. Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : I was wondering if you could just help me -- you threw out a lot of numbers there. Can you just help me reconcile kind of the Europe number? Because if I take out the currency benefit and I take out what you said for TDX, it looks like that market's down close to 9%. And I didn't -- it's not kind of what I heard, so I just want to make sure I'm doing the right math, for one. Richard F. Smith: So you're looking for the core organic non -- core organic growth rate in Europe? Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Yes, core organic, FX adjusted. Like the core business seems like it's down 9% based on that math. Richard F. Smith: That's not right, no. Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : And it didn't sound -- you had about almost a $5 million benefit on FX, I think, in Europe. And then it sounded like it's 16 points. There's like $21 million for TDX. That puts you at $44 million. Is that right? Richard F. Smith: You got that? John W. Gamble: 22% local [indiscernible] acquisition. Richard F. Smith: International Europe he's asking, right? John W. Gamble: Just Europe. Richard F. Smith: Yes, just Europe. Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Yes, I'm just trying to pinpoint how Europe is kind of shaking out for everybody. Richard F. Smith: Who's got that? Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : And I can follow up with that. Richard F. Smith: Let me tell you, I don't -- it's not going to be down 9%. It's up. Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay. I'll follow up with the details. I felt like something wasn't right there, but the numbers just kind of spoke to that based on what I heard. Richard F. Smith: Well, Dan, let's continue through on the last statement. We'll come back... Jeffrey L. Dodge: Mid single-digit organic growth in Europe, taking out TDX. Richard F. Smith: In Europe. How about FX, local currency? Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : And if you take out FX, then it's another $5 million. Richard F. Smith: My recollection was it's about 5% or 6% local currency growth rate organically in Europe, but we'll confirm that. Is that right, Jeff? That is right, that is right, Dan. It's a 5% to 6% growth. Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then I wanted to kind of circle back. It sounds like the good news is mortgage is, as you say, the headwind's abating. Things are turning. We've got a HELOC market that's kind of new and different from last time around. But what I'm wondering is, can you remind us, to the extent that those -- both new refined HELOCs start to actually turn into something that's positive, I don't want to get caught off guard on the mix in the margin. I feel like that would be negative to margins in aggregate. Is that a true statement or not? Richard F. Smith: No, no, it's not. I'm fairly agnostic. The lower-margin business tends to be the tri-merge businesses. We got expense associated with that. But I mean, home refinancing versus HELOC, they're a good solid margin business for EWS as well as USCIS. Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Right, okay. And then in terms of refi versus new origination, the refi is lower because you're just pulling the kind of abridged tax return. Is that right? Richard F. Smith: Correct. Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then just one last one. When you look at the type of credit decisioning that your bank partners have in the United States, like the insight that you're seeing there, can you just give us a sense of where you think their lending appetite is, just more broadly in the states? Richard F. Smith: Yes, I'd say with the uncertainty in mortgage, they tend to be -- continue to be very, very cautious on -- in the mortgage market and I don't blame them until we get regulatory clarity coming out of Washington. As I mentioned before, I think they're jumping back in, in a very aggressive way on the automotive lending. Now I'd say on credit card, they're starting to go down subprime, Dan, but they're going down subprime with very small lines of credit versus going down market with higher -- lower credit scores and higher lines. So when you're seeing lines, $500, $600, $750 for the subprime market but they're getting back in the subprime credit card lending now. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Ginocchio of Deutsche Bank. Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Just looking at Consumer Financial Marketing or Financial Marketing Services, it looks like it decelerated from the second quarter of high single digits to the third quarter of low single digits. Just wondering what drove that, particularly in light of your -- just your comments. It seems like banks are somewhat trying to find new customers. I just would have thought that number would've done a little bit better in this sort of improving job market. Richard F. Smith: Well, think about it this way. In the Marketing Services, there's really 3 lines of business. They're not kind of combined, so there's a little bit of noise in there. There is the core, which you're familiar with, the CMS business, Credit Marketing Services. There's the IXI business, which you're familiar with. And now there's the Marketing Services business we have in commercial, which we call internally MDS. So you got 3 things going on there. MDS is down year-on-year, and you got good strong growth in IXI and overall strong growth in traditional USIS or USCIS marketing business. Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : So I guess the takeaway is that it's just the commercial business that's weak and we're still seeing banks reaching out and trying to find new customers. That's not changed? Richard F. Smith: Yes, correct. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust. Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : Rick, appreciate the color on some of the USIS wins, especially Social Security and CMS. When you combine sort of the tailwind and the momentum you've got there with the anniversary of some of these faster-growing acquisitions, it strikes me that at least maybe the high end of the 6% to 8% core non-mortgage organic is a reasonable expectation for '15. Can you just kind of comment on that? Richard F. Smith: Yes, I -- as I mentioned in my closing comments, the team continues to execute at a very high level. We've, for a number of quarters or years now, been in that range. I expect us to clearly be in that range in fourth quarter and clearly be in that range in 2015. Fine-tuning where in that range is a little too early at this time, but as we get into 2015, I'll give you more color at that time. But just know I remain committed that we're going to be in that range of 7% to 10%. Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : Okay. Are there any sort of intrinsic or cyclical headwinds? Because it seems like not only winning new business but the nature of the business is becoming more diversified from an end market and customer perspective. Are there any offsets, at least qualitatively, you can think about to the new business you're winning? Or you're just kind of being cautious because it's not even November yet? Richard F. Smith: No, it's not -- I don't think it's being cautious. It's a business model we're committed to, and it's early for me to sit here and give you any additional color on '15 and beyond. The model we've given you before, which is organic of 6% to 8%, 7% to 10%, total of 25 basis points margin, it's just a little too early. Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : Okay. And could you just comment a little bit on the pipeline? It seems like you're winning again more maybe government agency business. Is that -- if you look at the pipeline of prospective deals that's out there, is the nature of the business or the characteristics of the customers materially different today than it might have been a couple of years ago? Richard F. Smith: No, I think the one thing you hit on there is when we won the CMS business in EWS, that opened up contacts within the federal government which we had not had before. And as a result of that, we took advantage of that, built a vertical focus to capitalize on that. I don't think it'll materially change the revenue mix of who we are going forward 3, 4, 5 years, but it's nice significant wins in an arena, 2 or 3 years ago, we didn't do business with. Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : Okay. And I guess, last, from a capital allocation standpoint, good to see you're buying back the stock. Are you still in the market sort of hunting for acquisitions? Or would you characterize that as being opportunistic? Richard F. Smith: Yes, absolutely, and the model hasn't changed. Most of our focus is on core organic growth, and when we get the right strategic acquisitions, we'll do so. John talked about in his comments buying back 113 million of shares in the third quarter. You should expect us short term in the fourth quarter to continue to be in the market buying back shares. But we'll also, because of our model and how much cash we throw off, also be looking for the right deals. And our model is 1 to 2 points of acquisition growth per year, so that hasn't changed. Operator : And we'll move on to our next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : I just want to work through the currency to make sure that we understand it properly. Was the $5.6 million of currency headwinds a year-over-year headwind? Or is that a difference from what you guys were expecting at the time you gave guidance in July? John W. Gamble: It was year-over-year, but the bulk of that happened since the forecast was given in July. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. So when you're looking at your margin profile internally versus what you were expecting, are you looking at kind of an OPM of 26.8%, adding back the $4.3 million in terms of your operational look at the business? Richard F. Smith: You're saying if you adjust for FX, what would the operational... Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Yes. Right. I'm getting a 26.8% if I adjust for that. Is that kind of the way you guys were looking at it as you were entering the year or, excuse me, entering the quarter? That's kind of the target and that's where you guys kind of feel like you were, absent the headwinds. Richard F. Smith: It sounds like you've done the math. We don't get the whole granularity where you adjust operating margin based upon FX, but I trust your math is right. We could do that math. But the margin profile, we've committed to be up 25 basis points a year. You're going to have some noise, Shlomo, quarter-to-quarter. I think that weren't we up -- what was the margin this quarter versus last year? Up 20 basis points, so largely in line with what we guided to. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. And then what was the non-mortgage underlying growth, so constant currency, non-mortgage growth? So you said it was between the 6% to 8%. Can you give us a more exact number? Richard F. Smith: Yes, it was 6.4%. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. And then what was in that other income line? It was like around $3.5 million. What was that comprised of? John W. Gamble: It's just basically generally net of interest income and interest expense in general, right? And it was up this year basically because last year, we had losses due to some activities in Latin America and repatriation of funds that didn't occur this year. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : So I'm not really following what that was. There were some kind of gain that can't -- there was a gain in other income, excluding the interest expense. Was that interest income that you're talking about? John W. Gamble: Yes, interest income, net of expense, and then there's some other FX gains that occur in there. But the reason it's up year-on-year is because we had losses last year related to some repatriation of funds, and that's why it's lower last year than normal. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. And if you don't mind, I was going to sneak in some housekeeping. What tax rate are you assuming for the fourth quarter? Richard F. Smith: I couldn't hear what you said, Shlomo. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Tax rate? John W. Gamble: Tax rate, about 35%. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : 35%, okay, so consistent. And then just anything else from the legal settlements? In other words, do you still have the right to use whatever software that you guys want and things like that? Or is there anything lingering or this just settles it and that's it? Richard F. Smith: I'll jump into the legal settlement in a second and go back. On tax rate, we've always guided our tax rate over an annual basis, will be between 35% and 37%. If you look back to second quarter, we're actually over 37%, 37.2%. A little under that number this quarter, but back in the range next quarter. So for the full year, John, we expect tax rate to be in that range of 35% to 37%. John W. Gamble: Absolutely, yes. Richard F. Smith: Back to the legal settlement, ask your question one more time, Shlomo, specifically? Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Just there was a legal settlement and it seemed to circle around the rights to use the software. So is there anything that's lingering that kind of hampers you? Or did that settlement entitle you to use whatever software you need right now? Richard F. Smith: None whatsoever. This was a contract that dates back to 2002. The team has worked through it. We have the right to use the software for a period of time going forward. It will have no impact on our business operations. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question from Jeff Meuler of Baird. Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : I guess, Rick, you talked about 2 things in terms of moving to new geos, TDX and I think data breach business. I know that's always a big driver for you guys. Can you just provide a more comprehensive recap on what the key initiatives are right now in terms of taking other products beyond those 2 to new geos? Richard F. Smith: Yes, thank you. Let me see if I can clarify that, Jeff. On TDX, it's clearly taking the TDX and the Inffinix and combining those as one platform, bring them to the U.S. and Rudy and his team are well on their way to doing that. We have resources on the ground in the U.S. We expect to launch some offerings in 2015. Canada has a very similar need that's not being served today. So those are 2 -- and we talked about Australia. There was a small business in Australia for TDX and we bought it. And I think I mentioned on the last earnings call, they won some really nice contracts in Australia, expanding our presence in Australia. And the benefit there is we get to know the market in Australia and now look for things like analytics decisioning platforms and other opportunities in places like Australia. The data breach is really taking a skinnied-down offering that works very well in Canada. The team up there has now closed multiple data breach deals in the last year or so and taking that to other current places where we operate in the International footprint, not new places. The third area for geographical expansion will be -- the next area will be just looking at expanding through acquisition our operations outside of the 19 countries or so we operate in today. Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. And then on the PSol, the third point to your growth strategy in terms of playing in a free or freemium market, is the model going to be an ad-supported one? Or are you thinking more about allegiance? So just how are you thinking about monetizing a free market? Richard F. Smith: Great question. Let me get back to the question, I can't remember the last -- earlier. But if you think about PSol going forward, the goal is to get it back to that upper single digit growth business starting next year. We'll do that by just optimizing the core churn, ARPU, new products, so on and so forth, and the indirect. We have yet to develop the full strategy for the freemium market. So when that is fleshed out, we'll let you know, but I don't need that to get to the upper single digit growth rate next year. Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. And then just finally, corporate expense. I know that you guys had previously been signaling for it to be somewhat variable quarter-to-quarter. But was Q3 roughly in line with your internal expectations? And then directionally, what should we be thinking about for Q4? Richard F. Smith: The answer for the third quarter is, yes, definitely in line with our expectations. John W. Gamble: Yes. And year-to-date, as we said, it's pretty much flat year-over-year, right, so... Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Yes, but -- so what should we think about for Q4? Because, I mean, I think it was up like $8 million sequentially. Should we be thinking about a similar absolute dollar level for Q4? Or should it come down somewhat? Just how -- any direction you could help -- give us available... John W. Gamble: It should come down in Q4. Operator : And we'll move on to our next question from Jeff Volshteyn of JPMorgan. Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : I only have like a couple of housekeeping questions. In regards to the fourth quarter guidance, could we get into the details, the components of revenue growth, what's implied for core non-mortgage constant currency growth, M&A contribution, mortgage impact and the share count? Richard F. Smith: I couldn't write those down fast enough. Let me just take off a few. We're not going to get into the growth rates at the business unit level at this juncture for the fourth quarter. But in total, we would expect the core organic non-mortgage growth rate to again continue to be in the range that we've committed to of 6% to 8%. On the share count, you should expect us again to be buying back shares of -- at a similar pace that we did in the third quarter. So with that, you could do the calculation on the share count as we exit the year. What was your third and fourth question? Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : M&A contribution and the mortgage impact. Richard F. Smith: Okay. On the M&A, I don't expect any additional M&A impact beyond the acquisitions we've already closed earlier this year. And on the mortgage impact, I think the mortgage market expectation for this year, for the fourth quarter, Jeff, has it moved closer to flat market itself? John W. Gamble: Yes. Richard F. Smith: Yes, it should be moving closer. I think it was down -- the bankers' index was down 26% in the third quarter and that's going to move closer to flat as you exit the year. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question from George Gregory of Exane. George Gregory - Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division : I had 3 questions, if I may. I'll take them each in turn. Firstly, in terms of OCIS, could I check, you saw a modest acceleration from Q2 to Q3. Against that, you saw an abatement in the mortgage headwind. In underlying terms, was there any change in trend there? Richard F. Smith: Versus the second quarter, is that your question, Greg? George Gregory - Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division : Correct, yes. Richard F. Smith: No, no, I'd say that -- we saw -- we talked about -- earlier someone asked the question about margin in USCIS and I talked about the fact that our core credit product, online credit products within OCIS grew nicely and that had high margins. So if anything was unusual, that grew at a little faster rate. That was really driven by the fact that our -- we call, you're familiar with this, Greg, I know you're from the U.K., KCP, key client program, which are some of our larger, more strategic customers. Both FI, private-label credit card issuers, and telco grew at a very nice rate in the quarter. So -- but those are 2 trends that have been occurring now for a few quarters. George Gregory - Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division : Okay. Second, in terms of Latin America, in particular, in Brazil, is it fair to say that you're now, albeit off of a small base, taking some share from your larger competitor? And on that subject, is there -- is that in particular on the consumer side or the business side? Any color you could add to that, please. Richard F. Smith: Greg, since we don't consolidate that asset at this juncture, I can't go into this level of detail, but I'll tell you this. We spent a lot of time down there, as you might guess, with the team and continue to like the asset medium term, short term and long term. So I'll leave it at that. George Gregory - Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division : Very good. And final question, we've talked quite a bit about PSol already, but any particular comments on the competitive environment there, in particular, in the freemium space? Richard F. Smith: I think it's here to stay. And I applaud the team. They're facing the reality that the market shifted pretty quickly a few quarters ago. And rather than ignoring it, they've stood up and created a modified business plan that will get us to that double -- that upper single-digit growth rate. So freemium is here to stay. I don't see it going away. George Gregory - Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division : And maybe just to finish. When do you expect to have decided upon a strategy to play in the freemium market? Richard F. Smith: I would think as we get on the phone with you guys, in the first quarter, we'll lay that out for you. Jeff? Operator : And as we have no further questions, I would like to turn it back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks. Jeffrey L. Dodge: Okay. With that, I'd like to thank everybody for their time and their interest in Equifax. And with that, we'll terminate the call. Have a good day. Operator : And that does conclude our conference. We thank you for your participation.",

Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Dodge. Please go ahead, sir. Jeffrey L. Dodge: Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Jeff Dodge, Investor Relations, and with me today are Rick Smith, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com. During this call, we'll be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2013 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. We will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax, adjusted operating revenue and adjusted operating margin that will be adjusted for certain items which affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance. Adjusted operating revenue includes the collection of certain reserved 2012 billings from 2013 revenue. Adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes acquisition-related amortization expense and the associated tax effects as well as certain other items. The other items excluded for 2013 are the collection of certain reserved 2012 billings, which occurred during the fourth quarter of 2013, the resource realignment charge and the impairment of our investment in Boa Vista. In 2014, we also excluded the associated tax effects in addition to the impact of a settlement of a legal dispute over certain software license agreements. The adjusted operating margin also excludes certain items. For 2013, adjusted operating margin excludes the collection of certain reserved 2012 billings and the resource realignment charge. For 2014, the adjusted operating margin excludes the legal settlement regarding the dispute over software license agreements. All of these measures are detailed in our non-GAAP reconciliation tables included with our earnings release and also posted on our website. Also, refer -- please refer to our various investor presentations, which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.equifax.com for further details. Now I'd like to turn it over to Rick. Richard F. Smith: Thanks, Jeff, for that very detailed introduction, that was great, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. As I always do, I'll go through the high-level review of the fourth quarter. Jeff -- or John will then go through the financial. I'll come back with an outlook for 2015, then we'll go to Q&A. We finished 2014 in very strong fashion and we carry some good momentum as we move into 2015. Looking back at last year, both reported growth and constant currency growth in the fourth quarter finished at their highest level of the year, which is always a good thing. For the quarter, fourth quarter 2014, total revenue was $625 million, up 8% on a reported basis and up 10% on a local currency basis from the fourth quarter 2013. In the quarter, FX created a $13 million year-over-year headwind, which was a significant increase from the third quarter headwind of $6 million. I think you all are intimately aware of what's going on with the euro, the ruble, the pound and others. Core non-mortgage market growth accelerated nicely to 8% in the quarter ending the year at 7%, solidly in the range of our long-term growth model. Consistent with the view we've articulated throughout the year, the mortgage market was no longer a headwind in the fourth quarter. As a result, in 2015 and beyond, we'll focus our attention on the constant currency organic growth rate. What I mean by that is we've broken out the past few years -- because of volatility, we've broken out mortgage impact and we'll no longer do that because we, as I'll talk about later on, we expect the mortgage market to be relatively benign year-on-year when we look at 2015. The adjusted operating margin for the fourth quarter was 26.5%, in line with the guidance that we gave you for the quarter. Our adjusted EPS was $1.02, up 12% from $0.91 a year ago, and it was at the upper end of the range that we've guided to. Also, given our strong performance for the quarter and the year, we've announced a 16% increase in the dividend, moving from $0.25 a share per quarter to $0.29 a share. As I always do, we transition into some of the business units highlights that I think are noteworthy. First, let's start with USIS. They accelerated their revenue and their margin -- and expanded their operating margins throughout 2015, and they're poised to deliver an even stronger top line growth and margin expansion in 2015 than they delivered in 2014. A couple of highlights. Decision 360, which we've talked to you a lot about, continues to deliver unique value for our customers and drive revenue growth for us. A couple of interesting data points. In 2014, if you take our top 100 customers, on average, they use now up from 1 product to 3 different unique data assets that we have, which is really adding value to them and to us. It's even a better story when you look at our KCP accounts. We've talked to you about that, the key client program accounts, about 8 of our largest customers in the United States. On average, they are now consuming 4.5 products, unique data assets that we have. And again, anytime we can bundle the unique data assets together to add value to a client, they win and we win. So Rudy Ploder and his team have done a great job of not just monetizing these assets, but making it easy for our customers to consume. Sticking with USIS. We continue to make great progress in the auto sector, where we provide not only credit information to our auto customers, but also adding now employment income verification. In 2014, revenues from our auto group grew by 17%, almost 3x the rate of the market growth. We expect that trend to continue in 2015 as well. IXI had a very successful year, returning to strong double-digit growth, driven by new product innovation and deeper penetration with some of our largest, most important customers. One of our more significant and unique fraud initiatives, ID management and authentication, continue to position us well with large government contract opportunities, particularly with the federal agencies, such as Social Security Administration and the IRS. In 2014, we processed over 516 million identity verifications within the government and across all verticals in the U.S. alone. Through the concerted effort of USIS, enterprise selling has become an integral part of our go-to-market initiative. We developed a detailed strategy for each vertical, including pricing, product innovation, distribution, incentive compensation, enabling us to further accelerate market growth and penetration. On to International, we had an outstanding execution of the NPI initiatives. They delivered a vitality index of 14%, fueling solid growth in virtually every market where we operate. We anticipate revenue growth to be at the upper end of the long-term range for 2015, which is 7% to 10%, and we expect margins to expand nicely throughout the course of 2015. Some highlights there. Single-digit growth in our core Information Solutions product offerings, coupled with double-digit growth in Decision Solutions and Personal Solutions, resulted in another year of strong organic growth and a much stronger market position as we enter 2015. U.K. exited the year with double-digit growth and very high-single-digit growth rate for the year, significantly outpacing the economic environment growth. Particularly for us, it was a double-digit growth in decision analytics and Personal Solutions. That's a trend that's continued now for 3 or 4 years in the U.K. Canada exited the year with very healthy double-digit constant currency growth rate, primarily driven by their core Information Solution product offerings. Those are 2 great examples of where the team is executing at a level enabling them to grow at significant levels above and beyond what the economy is contributing. Latin America delivered broad-based, double-digit constant currency growth across virtually all major product lines in all countries. In Russia, we added over 20 million records to the credit database and have significantly expanded the data assets in our fraud prevention system. We should talk a little bit about Russia, we've got some questions. Obviously, the sanctions and the ruble will impact our view of Russia going forward, at least for 2015. Finally, all of the centers of excellences that support our business units, especially in this case, International, have dedicated significant resources to ensure the successful integration of TDX. And I believe right now, the integration of TDX is largely behind us. TDX and the COEs will now focus their immediate attention on the very large opportunity with the U.K. government that we announced in December. For that project, which is going well, there'll be required IT developments in order to meet the security requirements of the U.K. government. We're, in essence, standing up the environment to handle what the government needs. It's going as planned, as scheduled. We expect that environment to be stood up sometime in the late second quarter to mid-third quarter. Start getting the data into system at the time, it takes us some time to format the data, cleanse the data and then work with our partners, the collection agencies. We expect to monetize -- start monetizing that win some time in the late fourth quarter and ramp up really nicely in 2016. So that's going as planned. On the Workforce Solutions. They had a blockbuster year in 2014. Despite significant headwinds from the mortgage market, Workforce Solutions delivered strong double-digit, non-mortgage market organic growth once again and 270 basis points of margin expansion for the year. We're expecting to get another really solid, good growth here in 2015 for EWS as well as meaningful margin expansion once again, that's the great thing about those models. Our Workforce Solutions exited the fourth -- exited the year and the fourth quarter with core non-mortgage market organic growth rate of over 17%, remarkable. For the year, core non-mortgage market growth was 13%, driven by strong double-digit growth in auto, government and preemployment. We now have over 4,300 companies across the United States contributing employment and income information to The Work Number database. Our data and analytics initiatives, which we talked to you about now for a couple years, are key drivers of revenue growth in both 2014 and 2015. In fact, we are looking at 35% to 40% growth in our analytics product line across EWS in 2015. In 2014, we signed 227 contracts with companies who need to assure their compliance obligations under the Affordable Care Act. In addition to the incremental revenues, customers are also contributing their employment and income information to The Work Number database. So it is two bites of the apple, if you will, making money on the analytics for ACA as well as building the database at a much faster rate. We're also developing a number of other innovative analytical solutions to enlighten employers about the demographics and the profile of their workforce, truly taking EWS and bringing it to the level of any other business we have around in the world, if not even higher, in the area of analytics. We've also broadened our relationship with CMS, leveraging our historical records to provide employment income verification on individuals and alleviate their need to use alternative, more costly sources of information. We're expecting our CMS relationship to grow by over 50% in 2015 when compared to 2014. What I meant by that comment there is we started off with CMS just using very recent records off The Work Number, we're now going back to older records, which still add great value and provide solutions to CMS, thus providing an increased revenue source for us. Finally, our compliance center initiatives, such as I-9, are generating strong interest from employers who require great assurance on their compliance with numerous regulatory -- regulations and laws, and that's been a great growth vehicle for them and EWS. On the PSol. They have moved aggressively on their four-pronged strategy that I outlined briefly in the third quarter call, improving on their execution of delivering value-added products that consumers need and want, expanding our presence in the indirect market through the TrustedID acquisition, enhancing our International opportunities, leveraging our domestic delivery platforms and product strategies and evaluating opportunities in the lead generation space to compete more directly with the freemium companies that exist. We anticipate 2015 growth in margin will be in the range of their long-term model we communicated to you before. We have a variety of initiatives in value-based acquisitions and retention. We improved customer lifetime value of our core product offerings by almost 45%. We also have a number of other initiatives underway addressing our media strategy, increasing ARPU and lowering our churn, all of which enable us to deliver stronger growth and margin expansion. In the indirect market, our TrustedID team has signed contracts or is in negotiation with financial -- large financial institutions and nonfinancial institutions on opportunities, which, in aggregate, could represent up to $25 million of annualized revenue potential. H&R Block is an excellent example of how we're developing highly customized and unique product offerings which support and enhance our indirect partners' customer relationships. It also underscores how Personal Solutions is developing new products and expanding its distribution channels with solutions that help consumers address the ever-growing threat of identity theft. Millions of taxpayers are victims of tax identity theft, where criminals use a consumer's personal information to file a fraudulent tax return. Leveraging our data and analytics expertise, combined with H&R Block's tax-related capabilities and expertise, H&R Block's Tax Identity Shield provides consumers with the ability to better understand their vulnerabilities for tax identity theft, and most importantly, take the appropriate steps to help reduce that vulnerability. This is the first and only tax theft -- tax identity theft protection and restoration system product in the marketplace today, and we're proud to be working with a great partner like H&R Block. For the past few years, North American Personal Solutions team has worked very closely with their counterparts in the U.K. to accelerate the growth in the U.K. Effective in January of this year, we've decided to realign our Personal Solutions segments to include now the U.S., Canada and the U.K. And eventually, we expect to make this a global business, including Latin America. And the whole goal here is to leverage the infrastructure and expertise and the investments we're making in our largest PSol business, which is the U.S., to accelerate growth around the world, and it's paying dividends. Finally, Personal Solutions has been very innovative with a vitality Index of over 17% for 2014, the highest of any business unit in the company. And it's one of the reasons why we believe there'll be a number of opportunities in the lead gen space for us to deliver incremental revenue growth and to establish a strong, competitive position in the marketplace. Our unique mix of consumer data assets and strong partnerships with many of our customers should enable us to grow superior solutions in this space. Before I go over to John, let me just transition back with some things going on at the corporate level. At the corporate level, in addition to improving our overall operating efficiency with our LEAN organization, which you're aware of, has been around for about 8, 9 years now, at the request of some of our key client customers, our largest customers, the large A customers, we have now rolled out LEAN at their request into their operations. This effort has significantly strengthened our relationship with these customers and providing valuable insights on how to further reduce their operating expenses and improve effectiveness through the application of our various product offerings, a really unique way to add value to our customers at their request. New Product Innovation at the corp level continues to be one of our strongest engines for growth. We launched last year what we call NPI 2.0, and what that's done for us is enhance our Voice of Customer process to better understand our customers' needs and challenges. We've developed a better market testing environment that enabled us to bring products to market faster, build prototype and to launch full speed, to establish metrics for -- reestablish metrics for local NPI and made more effective use of our different IT platforms. So it's really refreshed NPI, and the results were solid last year. Here's an example. We're building products, as I said, faster, accelerating revenue at faster rates. And a great example is what we're doing in our Fraud and ID services, revenue of which globally was up over 17% last year. So it enables Fraud and ID to prototype a product faster, get customer feedback faster and then launch that product faster than we ever could in the past. So we should see time to revenue for NPI be reduced as a result of what we're doing with 2.0. In short, 2014 was an outstanding year. In addition to delivering record revenue and earnings growth, the team executed well on our 4 corporate imperatives and they are : delivering consistent, strong, profitable growth and shareholder returns; number two, developing unparalleled analytical insights, leveraging our unique data assets; three, continue to innovate for market leadership in key domains and verticals that are important to us; and fourth, further strengthen our reputation as a trusted steward and advocate for customers and consumers around the world. So with that, John, the financials, please? John W. Gamble: Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As before, I'll be referring to the financial results from continuing operations generally presented on a GAAP basis. The FX headwind accelerated in the fourth quarter beyond what we originally expected. For the quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, revenues were negatively impacted by approximately $13 million and adjusted EPS was negatively impacted by about $0.03 a share. Now let me turn to the business unit financial performance for 4Q '14. U.S. Information Solutions revenue was $284 million, up 3% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. Online Information Solutions revenue was $198 million, up about 7% when compared to the year ago period. Mortgage Solutions revenue was $25 million, also up 7% compared to Q4 2013. This compares favorably to the Mortgage Bankers Application index, which was down 13% in the fourth quarter. Financial Marketing Services revenue was $61 million, down 10% when compared to the year-ago quarter. IXI revenues were up double digits from 2013. The decline in CMS was primarily driven by $7.2 million of prior year revenues, which are detailed in our non-GAAP reconciliation tables and which Jeff referred to in his introduction. Excluding these prior year revenues from 2013, Financial Marketing Services would be up about 0.7% and CMS would be down about 1%. The operating margin for U.S. Information Solutions was 40.8%, up from the adjusted operating margin of 39% in the fourth quarter of 2013. International's revenue was $159 million, up 15% on a reported basis and up 25% on a local currency basis. Acquisitions contributed approximately 15 points of the local currency growth. Constant currency organic revenue growth was about 10%. By region, Europe's revenue was $72 million, up 44% in U.S. dollars and up 47% in local currency, driven by the acquisition of TDX. Organic revenue growth in Europe was slightly above 10%. Latin America's revenue was $49 million, down 3% in U.S. dollars but up 13% in local currency, which included the acquisitions of Inffinix and the credit bureau in Paraguay. Organic growth was 6%, driven by double-digit organic growth in Decision Solutions and Analytical Services. Canada revenue was $39 million, with organic growth of 3% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currency. For the fourth quarter, International's operating margin was 22.6%, down from 29.1% in the fourth quarter of 2014. Workforce Solutions revenue was $129 million for the quarter, up 15% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. All growth in Workforce Solutions was organic. Verification Services, with revenue of $81 million, was up 24% when compared to the same quarter in 2013. Employer Services revenue was $48 million, up 2% compared to last year. The Workforce Solutions operating margin was 32.5% compared to 28.9% in Q4 2013. North America Personal Solutions revenue was $59 million, up 2%. Growth was driven primarily by Canadian subscription growth and indirect revenue through TrustedID. For the fourth quarter, operating margin was 33.7% compared to 30.7% in Q4 2013, largely driven by reduced marketing expense in the quarter. I should note that the figures I just presented reflect the organizational structure as it existed on December 31, 2014. As Rick noted, as of January, we have realigned our business units, consolidating our U.K. Personal Solutions along with North American Personal Solutions into the new Personal Solutions segment. In the attachments to our earnings release, we are providing 8 quarters of restated history for the segments as we will be reporting them in 2015. We also present our multiyear business model in the new business unit configuration. For the full year 2014, consolidated revenue of $2.44 billion was up 6% on a reported and an adjusted basis and up 7% on constant currency basis. The full year operating margin was 26.2% while the adjusted operating margin was 26.5%, down slightly from 26.7% in 2013. Diluted EPS attributable to Equifax was $2.97 compared to $2.69 for 2013. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $3.89, up 8% when compared to the adjusted EPS of $3.60 in 2013. Operating cash flow was again very strong at $203 million in 4Q '14 and $616 million for the year. We continued our aggressive stock buyback activity, repurchasing 1.4 million shares for $115 million in 4Q '14 and 3.9 million shares for $302 million in calendar year 2014. Our strong cash flow in 2014 allowed us to complete $340 million of acquisitions in addition to over $300 million in share repurchases and still maintain a very conservative leverage ratio of 1.8x EBITDA. We believe we have significant debt capacity available to us within our current credit ratings and are comfortable operating at leverage ratios in the 2.5x EBITDA area. With our strong cash flow and substantial available leverage, we can implement the 16% dividend increase we announced yesterday and continue a substantial share repurchase program while completing acquisitions consistent with the high end of our targeted 1% to 2% of annual revenue range. Now let me turn it back to Rick. Richard F. Smith: Thanks, John. I'll quickly summarize before we go to questions. As we look at 2015, we expect the U.S. mortgage market will move from a headwind to slightly positive year-on-year. We could discuss that in detail during the Q&A. We expect, however, FX will continue to represent a headwind for both revenue and EPS throughout the year. The guidance I will provide is organic growth only at this time. However, as the year unfolds, I would anticipate adding to our overall growth rate through some M&A. With that and based upon the current level of domestic and international business activity and current FX rates, we expect 2015 revenues to be between $2.550 billion to $2.6 billion. This reflects constant-currency organic revenue growth of 7% to 10% in 2015, which is up from a 4% growth rate in 2014. The strong revenue growth is partially offset by what we anticipate to be 2 to 3 points of negative impact from FX. And again, this reflects organic growth at this time. At current FX rates, we expect adjusted EPS to be between $4.20 and $4.30 per share. Excluding the $0.12 per share negative impact from FX at the current rates, this reflects 11% to 14% growth in 2015, which is beyond the upper end of our range of the long-term model we have for growth, which is 10% to 13%. This guide is consistent -- the revenue growth is consistent with the long-term business model for organic growth. We also expect our 2015 operating margin to be up over 27%, which is up nicely from the 26.5% in 2014. Also, our priorities for capital allocation have not changed. We remain committed to our dividend policy of 25% to 35% of adjusted net income, reinvesting in our business with CapEx in the range of $75 million to $100 million and continuing our acquisition focus. Given our strong cash flow and conservative debt leverage, absent any major acquisitions, we intend to continue our current significant level of stock buyback activity. And finally, we anticipate the tax rate for the year to be between 35% and 36%. For the first quarter, we expect revenue to be between $632 million and $642 million, reflecting constant-currency organic growth rate of 11% to 13%, and this will be partially offset by 2 to 3 points of FX headwind. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.00 and $1.03, which is up 12% to 16%. Excluding $0.02 per share of negative impact from FX, this reflects 15% to 18% organic growth. And also for the first quarter, we expect operating margin to finish over 27%, which is up over 100 basis points from 2014. So with that, operator, if you could please open it up for any questions our audience might have. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first from David Togut with Evercore ISI. David Togut - Evercore ISI, Research Division : Nice to see the 16% dividend increase. Rick, could you comment on how many Work Numbers are now in the database. What are your goals for Work Numbers in the database, let's say, over the next year or 2? And what's the significance of the current number of work records in terms of driving business growth? Richard F. Smith: Yes, Dann has done a hell of a job there and his team, David, not only taking the traditional path to adding Work Number records, but being very innovative with things like the ACA platform with different partners out there, and we're seeing an acceleration at the rate at which we're adding records. The total database ended the year well over 250 million, the active database well over 60 million. We -- as I mentioned in my opening comments, over 4,300 companies now are contributing. That's growing at a rapid clip every year. I see no reason we can't get the active records up over 100 million records in the database, in total over 300 million. And as I've always said before, both add value. The historical records, as I've mentioned on the CMS talk a few minutes ago, is a great source of revenue, and elsewhere, and you obviously know the value of the active records. And the significance of getting that database -- continuing to drive it, obviously, is incremental revenue. Every time you add a record, you get a hit, you get X amount of dollars. But as you continue to go from 30 million active to 40 million to 50 million to 60 million to 70 million, the viability that database has in high-transaction volume verticals is greatly enhanced. So we're making great progress in places like credit card, automotive, insurance as some examples. David Togut - Evercore ISI, Research Division : Got it. And then just shifting gears, John, could you break down the online CIS unit growth and unit pricing trends in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis? John W. Gamble: Sure. So I think core credit decisioning volume was up 14% and revenue per transaction was down about 5%. And the down about 5% was really volume mix. David Togut - Evercore ISI, Research Division : And what are your thoughts for 2015 in terms of volume growth and revenue per transaction in online CIS? Richard F. Smith: I don't expect a significant mix change in 2015 versus 2014, David. What you're seeing on volume is great growth in places like KCP. Again, I mentioned before, those are our 8 most strategic, larger, more complex customers that we deal with, bank and nonbank. That was great growth last year. I expect that to continue in 2015. Automotive, I think I mentioned up 17%, 3x the market growth, that will continue. There's another dynamic, David, going on, which may be of be interest to everyone here, and that is kind of a shift, which is influencing the online activity. A shift for what we call prospect data feeds, which used to reside or does reside in our business called CMS. And what customers used to do is take this mass mailing to try to target people. What we're seeing our customers want to do now more is up-sell, cross-sell current customers at the point of sale. So what you're seeing is kind of a decline in the CMS prospect data feeds and an increase in prescreened, which is an online activity. That occurred last year. I expect that trend to continue to occur in 2015. Operator : We'll go next to Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Research Division : This is actually Greg calling up for Manav. Just wanted to ask about the seasonality of the revenue growth. You're showing the 11% to 14% -- or 10% to 14% revenue growth in the first quarter and 7% to 10% for the year. Is that differential coming from mortgage? Or how should we think of that throughout the year? Richard F. Smith: Greg, as you might know, the first quarter tends to be the slowest quarter for us and it tends to ramp throughout the year. It's a little stronger in the fourth quarter versus the other three. What you're seeing in the first quarter is a couple of factors. You mentioned one, yes, you follow the 10-year treasuries, you follow the interest rates and the mortgage applications are up in the first quarter. Our expectation, Greg, as I said in my opening comments, is we expect overall mortgage for the year to be a modest tailwind versus last year. You could see a little strength in the first quarter and then kind of dissipating as we go to second, third and fourth quarters. So mortgage is a little bit of a help in the first quarter. But beyond that, the number of wins we had last year across-the-board, that could be ACA or EWS and that could be automotive in USIS, a large direct-to-consumer win we talked about back in the third quarter is monetizing itself in the first quarter. So think about it as being overall great execution by the BU leaders, which is driving the first quarter growth rate at a higher level than we'd normally see, combined with some help from the mortgage market. Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. And then I guess, on Personal Solutions, you've got your large competitors shifting their strategy in the direct market with the new FICO product. Just wondering how you guys are thinking about the direct market and how you're positioning yourselves there? Richard F. Smith: I believe in the team. I believe in Trey. I think they've got a good strategy. It's a four-pronged strategy, which I laid out in the third quarter, which is, number one, to manage the core. Freemium's here to stay, no matter what. It's here to stay. So number one, he's got to manage his core business to the best of his ability, which is managing ARPU, managing churn, which they're doing. They've got great metrics. We've invested heavily in a new platform, we're calling it Renaissance [ph] within PSol, which enables them to launch products at a faster rate, better user interface and experience for the customer. Number two, he's got to leverage the headcount of his indirect model. We bought a company called TrustedID who's doing that. I mentioned $25 million worth of annual contracts that are in the pipeline, either closed or being negotiated right now. Number three, he's got to leverage everything he's doing, which is great in the U.S., to accelerate growth in Canada and the U.K. and take it to Latin America. Number four, he's in the process of developing his own free model. If you believe free is here to stay, which I do, why abdicate that responsibility to others? We're going to find a way to participate ourselves. So if he does that -- think about this as you think about building your models. Think about 2015 kind of being a transition year where performance improves throughout the year and 2016 and beyond is when we move back in that long-term growth model I communicated, which is mid- to upper-single-digit growth rates with mid- to upper-20% margins. Operator : We'll go next to Ryan Davis with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Ryan Davis - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : My first question is on the PSol segment. Outside of the reorganization, including U.K., what should we be thinking about as a sustainable rate of growth for the legacy business? And how much of it is direct to consumer versus the affinity today? Richard F. Smith: You've got a couple of questions there, Ryan. I gave -- just gave the overall growth, so I think it was a portfolio with 4 different levers that we have in PSol, and that's going to be the mid- to upper-single digit. I think what you're going to see over time is a low-single-digit growth for the core legacy business and faster growth in the indirect business and faster growth in the International segments and the freemium model over time. So right now, the indirect channel is a smaller piece of the total, but one of the fastest-growing pieces of the total. And that was -- that -- our capabilities are greatly enhanced. We bought TrustedID, whenever it was, 12, 18 months ago. Ryan Davis - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. No, that's helpful. And thinking about the margin progression in the International business throughout the year, I know you said you expected the margin to expand. Do you have any expectation or a target of where you expect to exit the year at? Richard F. Smith: Yes. We expect to be over 25%, between 25% and 26% as we exit the year. Operator : We'll go next to Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : I guess a couple of things. Starting with Workforce, great year. Rick, could you maybe elaborate a little bit on David's question about drivers. Is it primarily adding records? Or is it adding functionality and analytics, too? I'm just trying to understand sort of what the dynamics are there, so monetization and NPI and how that's influencing Workforce, in particular. And then given the momentum in that business, would you expect -- and I apologize if I missed this, would you expect '15 to show faster organic revenue growth than the long-term trend in that segment? Richard F. Smith: Great questions. Think about the strategy -- the growth strategy in EWS on 4 dimensions, and they're all equally important. Number one is increasing the size of the database at the fastest rate we possibly can, so going from 67 million to 70 million this year, 70 million to 100 million records. That is an enormous -- you know the math, Andrew. That's an enormous growth lever in and of itself. Number two is taking The Work Number assets to either new verticals or deeper into existing verticals. We are at the early stages, for example, in automotive. It is booming for EWS, but it's very early stages. So we need to penetrate that market deeper, faster, so on and so forth, same with credit card. So more verticals and deeper in the current verticals we participate in. Number 3, it is taking analytics to a new level. I think I talked -- I can't remember the exact numbers now, Andrew, but I talked about 40% to 50% growth in analytics. It's remarkable what we've done. And it's meaningful, I'm not going to disclose the numbers, but it's meaningful dollars to the corporation, let alone to EWS, what they have done the last couple of years in analytics. And again, that's early days as well. The fourth one, which we don't talk about a lot, but is very, very important, this is kind of my fault from years ago. When we look at the employer size -- you've got The Work Number, which is the verification side, as you know, and all the other great suite of products we have, unemployment claims, tax credit, compliance center, so on and so forth. Our mentality for years, we've owned this asset for 8 years now, it's hard to believe, but to be totally honest with you today, asset is only there to protect the core Work Number. That's kind of a tough way to wake up every morning, thinking I'm here to protect. So Dann and I, a couple of years ago, decided to change the mentality. They were bringing a great new leader in Scott Collins and really changed the culture, the capabilities and the mindset to growth. So they've gone from a just project, which means you have probably negative growth to flat, to now a business that will grow for us even though things like unemployment claims are at historical lows. So that's how I think about EWS, on those 4 levers. And as far as the organic growth in 2015, yes, I think I may have mentioned, I expect their growth rate in 2015 to once again be a stellar and it will be all-organic, stellar growth and meaningful margin expansions once again. Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : Right. Yes, those long-term targets are helpful, and pretty impressive upside in that segment from even what you just reported. I guess the other question in USIS. Could you kind of just rank order the revenue growth drivers in that business in terms of new product adoption at KCP versus, again, monetization versus anything else that is critical in that sort of high-single-digit organic revenue growth expectation? Richard F. Smith: Yes, let me tackle it from 2 angles, one is kind of strategic capabilities, another one will be verticals. On strategic capabilities, clearly, 2 significant growth drivers that we have experienced and will experience going forward. One is the -- what we call Decision 360, Andrew, which you're aware of. Now we have all these unique data assets. What Rudy has done is built this thing called the office or the connector. We've invested in systems. We have invested in prototyping capabilities that enable us now to take these unique data assets, pull them together and make it so much easier and faster for our customers to consume. That is really disrupting the marketplace. I think I mentioned that our top 100 clients are now consuming 3 products on average, our top KCP accounts are 4.5 to 5 products. So Decision 360, leveraging all these unique assets, is one huge strategic enabler. Number two is about 18 months, 2 years ago, we changed the organizational structure to a concept we call enterprise-wide, which is Rudy owns the relationship with all these large clients. So he takes all these unique assets and brings all those assets to the customers. That simplification of go-to-market strategy has helped. As far as verticals, that, I think, offers significant opportunity for core organic growth. Obviously, KCP, I mentioned significant growth last year. They will continue this year. Tom Madison's team have done a great job. Telco, we're uniquely positioned there. We have very unique data assets. Auto, we're growing at multiples of the market itself. In the midterm, I'd say -- what we're saying is a rebound in the home equity market. I think we talked about that last year. That will benefit Dann as well as Rudy. And I think that's a multiyear growth lever for us not just for 2015. Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : Okay. And one housekeeping one, if I may sneak it in. John, I noticed corp ex was up. I know there's some seasonality in there. It was above what we were looking for. Is there any callout in that? John W. Gamble: No. Corporate expenses, we'd indicated that we thought they're going be flat to slightly up. They were up a little more than we expected. It was really incentive compensation. We did a little better than we had thought and the incentive comp was a little higher. Operator : We'll go next to Ato Garrett with Deutsche Bank. Ato Garrett - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Just have one question on the resulting impact from the improving -- expectation for improving mortgage trends in the first quarter. Might that actually have a positive effect on price within USIS? Richard F. Smith: It's interesting. It'll have a positive influence on margin, and I don't think that's from a pricing perspective. If you think about the margin -- and there's different buckets or categories of mortgage. As you know, prime [ph] mortgage may be a little less profitable than the online. But in general terms, an improving mortgage market does help the margins in USIS and helps the margins in EWS. Operator : We'll go next to Nick Nikitas with Robert W. Baird. Nick Nikitas - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Just really a strong performance out of Canada in the quarter. Realize it's a smaller subsegment, but with growth accelerating to 12% constant currency year-over-year, can you just -- I mean you mentioned the broader Information Solutions strength that you're seeing, but can you talk more about the drivers behind that and your outlook for the business into 2015? Richard F. Smith: Yes, Nick, if I could take your question and maybe just expand it a bit because there are a couple of geographies I'm particularly proud of outside the U.S. and the growth, and you mentioned one, which is Canada, but the other is U.K. I mean, as a troubled economy, it's growing double digit as you exit the year. Another's Spain. I mean, let's go look at Spain. If you look at Spain, we're growing almost double digit there as we exit the year. It's just remarkable. Those 3 countries, which are not booming economies, by any means. Canada is a commodity-based economy, they're starting to slow. So the core you are seeing there -- or the reasons you're seeing the growth in Canada, to answer your question, as well as U.K. and Spain, is the same set of strategic initiatives we have across the company, it's innovation, it's building new products, it's taking products to market faster. It's driving analytics. It's leveraging Fraud and ID. So the core strategies important to Rudy Ploder and important to Dann Adams in EWS and Trey Loughran in PSol are the same initiatives that Paulino and his team in Canada, U.K. and Spain are driving. Nick Nikitas - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. And then just circling back to the Verification Services revenue. Can you guys talk about any benefit you saw from the ACA in Q4? And is that driving some of the expected strong growth in Q1? Richard F. Smith: Yes. So remember, ACA, you think about under 3 buckets. There is the contractual -- the contract we have at CMS. We think we've talked about it before that we'd expected last year to end the year slightly above the minimum guarantee, that's kind of what occurred, and that will accelerate, by the way, as I mentioned in my comments, in 2015. The second bucket of revenue that was definitely additive to growth was the analytics side of ACA, which we talked about, 227 accounts. Probably going to grow something like 40%, 50% this year. And the third bucket was ACA revenue growth, which I did mention in my comments, too, Nick is, every time you sell an ACA on the platform -- not every time, most times, to a company, they've got to give us their Work Number records, and many times those are Work Number records we never had before. So once we get them into the database, it's a reoccurring monetization. So all 3 of those had some assistance in fourth quarter 2014 and will accelerate in 2015. Nick Nikitas - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay, good to hear. And then just last one for me. Looking at the USIS margins, you mentioned the mortgage beneficial impact in '15. Just looking year-over-year, would you, I mean after salary growth in '14, should we expect that margin expansion to moderate going into '15? Richard F. Smith: Well, for us, as I mentioned in my comments, we expect the company to move to a margin level of over 27% in 2015. For us to attain that, every business has got to move in the right direction, including USIS. So I expect USIS margins to continue to expand. That's just the beauty of their model, of International's model, of EWS' model, the variable cost -- the fixed cost is so high. Yes, I'd expect the margins to increase. Operator : We'll go next to Brett Huff with Stephens Inc. Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Two questions from me. One, I just want to make sure I'm getting the 1Q versus full year guide. There was a question I think that someone opened with. And I think you answered mortgage a little bit better relative to the year-over-year comp early in the year and tapering a little bit. But aside from that, it sounds like the 1Q strength is just reflecting wins from last year. Is there something about those wins that they would taper? Or are we just sort of waiting until we see how the year plays out and maybe things get a little bit -- maybe we have more visibility as we go out? Richard F. Smith: It's more of the latter. It's -- I'm glad you asked the question, Brett. As we look at 2015, John and I and the BU leaders are very optimistic for the year. But to take those kind of growth rates and extrapolate those for the balance of the year, I think, is imprudent at this time. There's a lot of uncertainty where the 10-year treasuries go, what happens in Ukraine, what happens in Russia, what happens in the European economy, what happens in Greece. So not knowing or not having the clarity of what's going to happen on the macro perspective for the second, third and fourth quarter, I think it'd be imprudent to be too optimistic in the forecast we've given you now. The other thing, too, is, as I've mentioned, the forecast is largely all organic. And our philosophy is when you have a big deal like the one we won at TDX, one, getting the company integrated; and two, throwing all of the resources [ph] to get those multiyear couple of hundred million dollar opportunity up and running is the full focus of International team and of our M&A team, which is intimately involved in that. So we're kind of taking our gas -- or foot off the gas on the M&A. We'd expect that to pick up, and as I said before, in the second half of the year. Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Great. And just one final question, a little bigger picture. We thought USIS would show a little more strength, just our sense is that credit card offers are starting to sort of go out down into the prime and near prime from just the super prime. Credit's generally easing a little bit for consumers. We thought that would show up. It wasn't quite as strong as we thought. Is there a drag in there from North American Commercial? Or is there something kind of hidden in USIS that may be dragging a little bit that we can't see from the subsegments? Richard F. Smith: No, to address one thing, which I'm glad you brought it up. Even though we don't disclose it anymore, our Commercial business ended the year with their highest growth rate of the year in the fourth quarter. So when you look at drag, which specific line are you looking at? CMS? Online? What are you looking at when you referenced... Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division : We were just looking -- I think you guys came in at 3% all in for USIS, and I just thought generally those items, even sort of accommodating mortgage, I thought that -- we're just sort of sensing there's more, like I said, specifically on the credit card side, we just thought there'd be more pulls on your credit files than we did. So I just didn't know if you guys are seeing that or maybe not yet? Richard F. Smith: The only one thing that I think, John talked about it a little bit, is the fact that you have a big chunk of the business, CMS, that was flat and that impacts USIS in bulk [ph]. Operator : We'll go next with Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Look, you guys kind of alluded to this a little bit, but I wanted to just probe a little further. Between the capacity on the debt side and the healthy free cash flow and the low leverage, it's just kind of a setup for the potential for a big deal, potentially deploying somewhere around $1 billion, if you want to, without stretching the business really too far. Is there -- are there deals of that size in the pipeline potentially some time for this year? Or is that really not within the kind of the scope of what you're looking at right now? Richard F. Smith: Obviously, I'll stay at a high level, Shlomo, but you hit it on the head. We have the potential capacity to do a lot of midsized deals or some significant deals. I don't see this happening in 2015. You know my philosophy. You can only do so many large deals at a time. You want to make sure that they're operating at a level that our shareholders expect. Since I've been here in 10 years, we've done TALX, CMS, now TDX. So right now, all of our energy is really getting TDX up and running as a core business and getting us through the acquisition -- or this new win we announced up and running. So you'll see us doing deals this year, but you'll see us doing more mid- to small-sized deals. I just don't see that large, transformational deal front and center for this year. Plus, I don't really see the need to have to do a large deal this year. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. And there was -- I think it was the last quarter when we talked a little bit about the implementation times for TDX and making sure that you want to kind of get that right. The timing, the sales, the demand seemed to be good, but you want to make sure that the implementation works and that might be -- maybe went a little bit slower. In the additional 3 months since the last time we talked, has there been any kind of streamlining of that or improving kind of the implementation targets for TDX deals? Richard F. Smith: Yes, the answer is absolutely yes. And I alluded to it at very high level in my comments. We overwhelmed, in a positive way, I'd say, TDX on the integration front the second half of last year and really accelerated through the fourth quarter last year. We have supportive [ph] forecasting models down. We understand different variables. I'm very pleased with where Paulino and Andy Bodea from the operations perspective are. We've moved people over to Nottingham to assist and we are expecting double-digit growth from TDX in 2015, excluding any lift from that large deal we won in December. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. And then just moving a little bit to the freemium space. Can you talk a little bit about the kind of strategy over there and the work that you have to do just to make sure that you don't cannibalize the existing very kind of healthy margin business [indiscernible] Richard F. Smith: Yes, there are 2 strategies. If you just take and bifurcate the freemium into the 2 buckets, one is the organic path, which means different level of advertising, different type of advertising. And the other is the build with some sort of capability through M&A. We're looking at both. But Shlomo, I talked to the team about that and I think they get it as well. You talked about cannibalization. If we don't do something, those that exist in the marketplace will, in fact, cannibalize that for us. I would rather have our own product, which would be a high-margin product, cannibalize our core legacy business than give it to someone else. So it's a matter of fact. Over some period of time, the freemium model, I think, is going to be the dominant model. And it's either we find a way to participate ourselves or you get out altogether, I'm not going to do that. So there'll be some cannibalization, but it'd be [indiscernible]. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn it back to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks. Jeffrey L. Dodge: Okay. I thank everybody for their time and their interest in Equifax. And I think, with that, we'll terminate the call. Thanks, again. Operator : This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

Good day and welcome to the First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Dodge. Please go ahead, sir. Jeffrey L. Dodge - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Jeff Dodge, Investor Relations. And with me today are Rick Smith, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section of the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com. During this call, we'll be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in the filings with the SEC, including our 2013 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. We will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax, and adjusted operating margin that will be adjusted for certain items, which affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance. Adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes acquisition-related amortization expense and the associated tax effects and the charge principally related to the realignment of internal resources to more effectively support the company's strategic objectives. Our adjusted operating margin excludes the one-time charge principally related to the realignment of our internal resources. These measures are detailed in our non-GAAP reconciliation tables included in our earnings release and also posted on our website. Also please refer to our various investor presentations, which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website, www.investor.equifax.com for further details. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Rick. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. And as always, thank you for making time to join us this morning. The first quarter's performance was very robust and significantly exceeded our expectations. The thing you'll hear throughout my comments and John's comments in the question-and-answer period will be that the growth over the quarter was very broad based. It was across all business units, across many verticals and across many countries. USIS and Workforce Solutions in particular posted an exceptional quarter. USIS saw its strength with its Decision360 initiatives, enterprise selling strategy, direct-to-consumer channel partners, mortgage and home equity lending. Workforce Solutions saw broad strength in Verification Services including government, automotive and mortgage as well as solid strength in its Employer Services business. The revenue strength in both those businesses led to nice margin expansions as you saw. Also International and PSOL finished with very solid performances for the quarter. In total, the revenue was $652 million up 12% on a reported basis and up 14.4% on a local currency basis versus the first quarter of 2014. In the quarter, FX created $17 million of year-over-year headwind, an increase from the fourth quarter of last year, which was $13 million of headwind. The adjusted operating margin was 27.2%, up 120 basis points from the first quarter of 2014. Adjusted EPS was $1.07, up 20% from $0.89 a share last year and significantly above the upper end of the guidance we provided a few months ago. As I always do, I'll walk through some business-by-business unit highlights, and then John will get into the details of the financials. I'll start, as I always do, with USIS, there they leveraged their Decision360 initiative, new product innovation and enterprise selling teams to deliver 14% revenue growth and a healthy 42.4% operating margin, up 520 basis points from last year. Couple of highlights, our relationship with Credit Karma, as we've talked about in the past, it went live in January, and January transaction volumes exceeding our original projections. In addition to purchasing our credit information, Credit Karma is also using our Premier fraud and identity authentication solutions to provide consumers with online access to their credit information. Presently, we are part of a 2-Bureau solution with Credit Karma, but we believe this will ultimately move to a 3-Bureau solution in an effort to better maximize benefits to the consumers. As I mentioned on the last call, in recent quarters, one of the things we're seeing is that the financial institutions are changing the way they originate new consumer accounts in Financial Marketing Services, FMS. The traditional pre-screen activities are giving away to more targeted one-on-one online offers. We talked about this again last few quarters. And as a result, our revenue mix has gradually been shifting towards higher margin online solutions, while our growth in pre-screen revenues has moderated somewhat. Net-net, I view that shift as a benefit to USIS. As you know, we folded Commercial into USIS few quarters ago. The Commercial business is off to a great start, recording their best first quarter performance since 2007 with record revenue and operating margin performance. Mortgage origination and home equity lending were also strong during the quarter, as low interest rate environment resulted in lending activity that exceeded our expectations for the quarter. We'll get into that in the Q&A and compare it to the MDA (05:53). Our core 3-Bureau reporting volume was up 18% and we also experienced strong growth in our high-value undisclosed debt monitoring product services as lenders continue to move \u2013 continue with their more rigorous underwriting standards. The pace of mortgage refinancing activity and home equity lending continues to be solid and we expect it will moderate, as we talked about back in February, somewhat during the second quarter and then continue to moderate as we exit the year. USIS growth rate is expected to be strong over the course of the year and be comfortably above its long-term growth range of 5% to 7% for the full year. On to International, they posted double-digit local currency growth in five countries including the UK. The team continued to make good progress with the integration of TDX, which delivered constant currency revenue growth in excess of 25% for the first quarter, and they're also leveraging NPI to further their market position as many products delivered revenue above their expectation for the quarter around the world. International's ongoing effort to diversify its revenue base is underscored by double-digit constant currency growth from their SME customer base, retail customers, insurance customers, government customers and utility customers around the globe. Also, all verticals, including Financial, our Decision and Analytics Solutions, are strengthening relationships with our customers and opening new opportunities to NPI and new sources of growth going forward. International's operating margin performance is also improving. Excluding TDX and all the investments we're making in TDX, International's operating margin expanded by approximately 190 basis points in the quarter when compared to the first quarter of 2014. During the quarter, we executed a Debt Recovery Services Contract with Her Majesty's Government from the UK; we talked about last time. That's resulting in continued investment in TDX, as we're prepared to ramp up and go live sometime in late third quarter for this multi-year UK government opportunity. So, net-net, that opportunity is on pace and on track on almost every dimension. And again, we expect some modest revenue at the back end of this year, further ramping up in 2014 (sic) [2016] (08:22). In addition, the unique capabilities of TDX and also Infinix, that's the one we bought in Mexico, those capabilities are being leveraged in other geographic markets where we do not presently have credit information operating units. This year, International will be launching a Latin American regionalization strategy, that's what Jeff kind of alluded to, that includes people, process and system changes. This effort will further streamline our operations and provide incremental operating leverage for International and also improve customer service and accelerate our time to revenue through new product innovation. For the year, we expect revenue growth to be solidly in the long-term range of 7% to 10% growth in International with improved operating margins as we exit the year. On to EWS, their momentum accelerated in the quarter, remarkable performance with broad-based revenue growth of 24%, up from 15% growth in the fourth quarter and margins were up an astonishing 800 basis points from the first quarter of last year to 40.3% for the quarter. Verification Services continued to make great progress penetrating our targeted non-mortgage markets. We delivered strong double-digit growth in home equity lending, auto, card, consumer finance, government and pre-employment, combined with growth in the mortgage activity, drove a very healthy 34% growth in overall Verification Services revenue. In addition, our penetration of pure tier lending space with our Employment and Income Verification Services has delivered strong new sources of growth. We now have over 4,500 companies contributing their employment and income estimation into The Work Number database and this number of companies are growing on a monthly basis. The outlook for 2015 continued to be very good. Although mortgage originations are expected to slow, our revenues and various ACA initiatives, further penetration of Employment/Income Verification in non-mortgage markets and our strategic initiatives in Employer Services are expected to offset the mortgage decrease later this year, resulting in full-year revenue growth well above the top end of the multi-year range and margin expansion in the range of the neighborhood of 350 basis points or more versus 2014. On to PSOL, constant currency revenue growth was at the upper end of the multi-year range and operating margins continue to be strong. In addition, they're making good progress on their strategic transformation. Double-digit growth in indirect Canada and UK were the major contributors to growth in the quarter. For our direct-to-consumer activities in the U.S., the key operating metric, average revenue per subscriber and churn, continue to improve. 2015 will be a good transformational year for PSOL as we've talked about in the past. They're making good progress on three fronts : strengthening the core U.S. base business. Number two, developing a strong market position in the indirect space. And three, growing our international presence in Canada and the UK. We expect Personal Solutions to end the year with revenue growth comfortably within our multi-year target range. Let me go back to corp and I'll give you some highlights at the corporate level, and then turn it over to John for the financials. You've often heard us, I think it's been about nine years now, talk about NPI drives growth. In fact, we've talked about three points of growth coming from NPI. (12:06) delivered those three points growth for us in the first quarter. There's another very important growth driver, which was launched about three years or four years ago, we don't talk a lot about, and we launched it across all of our business units, and that's what we call Enterprise Growth Initiatives, EGI for us. It's a very systematic way for managing multimillion dollar revenue initiatives that we overwhelm with resources and process and senior management attention because of importance to the long-term growth. Our EGI initiatives had a banner first quarter performance with strong double-digit growth, exceeding our expectations for the quarter. And our outlook for the year continues to be for very strong year-on-year growth coming from EGI. Also at the corporate level, we're talking about how we've developed a strong reputation of our customers regarding our expertise in lien, and we're doing this globally. We're not only leveraging the relationships with our existing customers and continue to drive incremental revenue growth, but we're also opening doors with non-customers around the world because of the reputation we've developed in some of our very key verticals. It gives us yet another opportunity to grow revenue through stronger customer partnerships and really differentiate our offerings to these customers in yet another dimension. Our global fraud initiatives, which across all of our B2B business units, delivered solid double-digit growth for the quarter as well. In summary, the quarter's performance is the strongest first quarter performance we've experienced in many years. Sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter was up 4.4%, whereas in the past years, you would typically experience modest or even decline in sequential growth. Adjusted operating margin expanded 70 basis points from the fourth quarter and adjusted earnings per share increased almost 5% from the fourth quarter, and we usually see decline in sequential growth. Despite this unprecedented performance, we're still early in the year and there are still some uncertainties out there and the macroeconomic challenges around the globe. However, we are more optimistic now than we were when we entered the year. I'll turn over to you, John, now for some financials, and we'll come back with some closing comments. John W. Gamble - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President : Thanks Rick and good morning everyone. As before, I'll be referring to the financial results from continuing operations generally presented on a GAAP basis. During the quarter, we reported a charge of $23.4 million, principally related to the realignment of internal resources to more effectively support our strategic objectives. The actions were primarily driven by the regionalization and consolidation strategy in International, including the integration of TDX, consolidation of functions related to the integration of Commercial into USIS, and then some realignment actions across the remainder of the business. The cost for two-third severance would also include related real estate, legal and other costs. The costs are reflected in SG&A and the general corporate expense lines of our financial statements. The actions will occur throughout 2015 and should be completed within 12 months. Ongoing savings, once the actions are complete, are expected to be $10 million to $15 million per year with limited incremental benefit in 2015. Now consistent with our past practice for treating unusual or infrequent items, we have excluded this charge from our adjusted EPS and adjusted operating margin in order to provide investors with a more consistent period-to-period operating comparison. The FX impact on revenue and EPS this quarter were consistent with our expectations that we provided to you in February. Now, let me turn to the business units' financial performance for the quarter. U.S. Information Solutions revenue was $299 million, up 14% when compared to the first quarter. Online Information Solutions revenue was $222 million, up 15% when compared to the year-ago period. Mortgage Solutions revenue was $31 million, up 28% compared to Q1 2014. These trends compare favorably to the Mortgage Bankers Application Index, which was up 21% in the first quarter. Financial Marketing Services revenue was $46 million, up 3% when compared to the year-ago quarter. As Rick mentioned earlier, this slower growth reflects a shift in how financial institutions are originating new accounts to 1 :1 online solicitations. The operating margin for U.S. Information Solutions was 42.4%, up from 37.2% in the first quarter of 2013. We continue to expect USIS to have operating margins in the low 40%s, consistent with our long-term model in 2015. International's revenue was $139 million, down 1% on a reported basis, but up 10% on a local currency basis. By region, Europe's revenue was $58 million, up 1% in U.S. dollars, and up 12% in local currency. Latin America's revenue was $48 million, up 2% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currency. Canada revenue was $33 million, down 9% in U.S. dollars, but up 3% in local currency. For the first quarter, International's operating margin was 20.2%, down slightly from 20.6% in the first quarter of 2014. This reduction in margin was principally due to FX. For the full year, we continue to expect the operating margin to expand slightly compared to 2014. Workforce Solutions revenue was $149 million for the quarter, up 24% when compared to the first quarter of 2014. Verification Services, with revenue of $86 million, was up 34% when compared to the same quarter in 2014. Employer Services revenue was $63 million, up 13% compared to last year. Following the WOTC hiatus in 2014, states began processing their backlog during the first quarter. Also, revenue from our ACA analytical solutions was very strong in the quarter. The Workforce Solutions operating margin was 40.3% compared to 32.3% in Q1 of 2014. The margin benefited from the WOTC renewal, which contributed approximately three percentage points to the margin in the quarter. For full-year 2015, we continue to expect Workforce Solutions operating margin to be in the range of 36% to 37%. Personal Solutions revenue was $66 million, up 4% on a recorded basis and up 6% on a local currency basis. For the first quarter, operating margin was 27.4% compared to 28.5% in Q1 2014. This year-over-year reduction is consistent with our expectations and the guidance we gave for Q1 and the full year. In the first quarter, general corporate expense, at $78.4 million, was up significantly, reflecting the $23.4 million realignment charge I mentioned previously. Excluding this charge, general corporate expense was $55 million, up $8.7 million sequentially and $24.3 million versus 1Q 2014. This increase is principally due to increased incentive and equity compensation and benefits expense. This reflects the very strong performance in 1Q 2015 as well as earlier timing of annual equity expense in 2015 versus 2014. We also saw increased professional, legal and regulatory costs in 1Q 2015 versus 1Q 2014. Looking at 2Q 2015, we expect general corporate expense to be down $10 million sequentially on an adjusted basis, reflecting lower equity expense and at or slightly below the Q2 level in both Q3 and Q4. Operating cash flow was $103 million in the first quarter. Cash flow grew faster than earnings, reflecting positive working capital performance. We continued our aggressive stock buyback activity, repurchasing 1 million shares for $90 million and paying $35 million in dividends to our shareholders. Our leverage remains a very conservative 1.75 times EBITDA. Now let me turn it back to Rick. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Great. Thanks John. Quick outlook for guidance for the second quarter and the total year. Before I give you some numbers, just want to put into perspective the influence of the mortgage market as it relates to the second quarter and the balance of the year. Again, we expect the market to \u2013 the mortgage market to perform much like we talked about back in February, moderating a bit in the second quarter and then continuing to moderate even further year-on-year in the third quarter and fourth quarter. So for the second quarter, we expect organic revenue growth \u2013 organic revenue to be between $655 million and $665 million, that is a constant currency organic revenue growth rate of 10% to 12%, and that's partially offset by three points of FX headwind. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.09 and $1.11, which is up 14% to 16%, excluding $0.02 per share of negative impact from FX. This reflects constant currency growth rate of 16% to 18% for the quarter. We also expect operating margin to continue to improve in the quarter in the range of 27.5% to 28%. Obviously, there is some uncertainty for the balance of the year, it's macroeconomic uncertainty around the world, it's U.S. economic uncertainty, some uncertainty in Middle East, uncertainty in Latin America. So \u2013 but against that uncertain backdrop, I'm convinced that this team will continue to execute extremely well and continue driving above-market growth across all of our businesses and all of our verticals through the second quarter and the balance of the year. So with that, and based upon the current level of domestic and international business activity and the FX rates, we expect 2015 to \u2013 a revenue range of $2.585 billion to $2.635 billion, which is up from our previous guidance. This reflects constant currency organic revenue growth of 8% to 11% for the year. This strong revenue growth is partially offset by three points of negative impact from FX, and again, as before, this is only organic revenue growth at this time. 2015 adjusted EPS, we expect to be in the range of $4.28 and $4.35 per share, also up from our previous guidance. This reflects 10% to 12% growth in 2015. FX impact for the year, as we previously stated in the last earnings call, is expected to be about $0.11 for the year. We had about $0.02 a share impact in the first quarter, which says we have about \u2013 remaining $0.09 per share impact for the full year. So with that, operator, let's open up for any questions our callers might have. Operator : Thank you. We'll go to Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Thank you very much, Rick, and for taking my questions, and John. I want to just drill in a little bit more very, very healthy growth across the company. The biggest, I would say, surprise was in the Employer Services; that has had the best growth it looks like in like five years. Can you talk a little bit about, just the stuff that came together specifically in the quarter and how I should be thinking about the growth? Have you gotten that to a sustainable double-digit growth level over there? How should I think about that? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Shlomo. I'd say there's two primary drivers to the growth. One, I think I mentioned it last year, that new leadership in there has been about a year or so, year-and-a-half, Scott Collins doing a heck of a job. He's changed the mentality out there from a business unit that's kind of protect the work number to a growth business model. So, he's built processes, he's changing the team. They think about growth, not protect, so that's helping him. And then you had a WOTC benefit for the first quarter that added some growth as well. So as I think about the Verification Services piece of EWS, Shlomo, when we bought the business, we thought it would be a good solid year-on-year middle-single-digit kind of growth rate. So I would not model a double-digit growth rate for Employer Services at this point. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So if I dig further down, how much of that was like ACA work and some of the stuff that's just compliance type work that's going to be sustainable going forward? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I mean in the Employer Services is a piece of business that is on fire. And I think we talked about it in the last earnings call, and that is what we call Workforce Analytics, and that is going to grow over 100% this year. And we've signed hundreds of contracts to help employers make sure they're compliant with the ACA laws. And remember as I mentioned before, Shlomo, we get multiple bites of the apple, there you get some consultant revenue, you get the analytics revenue and then in many cases, the employers who are using that analytics don't give us work number records; the only way we can analyze their level of compliance is to get the work number records. So that revenue growth, by adding those records to the database, don't show up in Employer, it shows up in Verification once they flow down the system. So you should consider ACA Analytics or Workforce Analytics as being a long-term sustainable growth piece of EWS's strategy. Also within the Employer Services, they are building out a really good full suite of compliance center products to help our employers ensure they're compliant with many regulatory changes, not just (26:53). Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So do you feel \u2013 I mean how much are you able to quantify or give a rough estimate as to kind of that virtuous circle of doing that type of compliance that's resulting in a work \u2013 The Work Number and then additional hits to the database that are coming back with something, so that's adding revenue to the Verification Services line? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Rest assured, we do know those numbers. We don't disclose those right now. But if you talk to Dann Adams, Shlomo, he would tell you, as would Scott, the guy that runs that part of the business, Shlomo, that the compliance center is a exciting multiyear growth strategy for EWS in total and clearly for the Employer side. We've given you some color in the past around the number of records added through ACA, through Workforce Analytics. And you know that the number on the average revenue per transaction, so you can build some sense of how important that is on the Verification side, it's meaningful. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: One last question, and then I'll drop off. How much did the Credit Karma relationship add to the year-over-year growth in OCIS? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We don't disclose individual client activity. We gave you a number, I think it was back in the fourth quarter of what it would be. We said $20 million to $25 million a year in revenue. So, in the scheme of things for the company, great customer, great win, not only significant for the company, but important for USIS. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Very good. Thank you so much. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next David Togut with Evercore ISI. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI : Thank you, and good morning, Rick and John. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hello David. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI : Quite a quarter. Since you touched on Workforce Solutions in some detail, could you provide a little more detail on the 18% unit growth you disclosed in USCIS in terms of the underlying drivers, sustainability of those drivers? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Again, as I tried to allude to in the \u2013 my opening comments as did John in his, it is extremely broad based, it is. Automotive was extremely strong. Our KCP clients was strong, Financial Services was strong, Telco was strong, Credit Karma was strong, mortgage channel partners were strong. It is extremely broad based. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI : And just as a follow-up, your 450 basis points of operating margin expansion in that business, do you have a higher target now for operating leverage in that business? Or is this short-term strength that will slow over time? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : The gift that keeps on giving, you always want more, David. I'd say the beauty of this model is, we have the ability to continue to invest in CapEx for organic growth. And as you're growing, the leverage you get is phenomenal. So that exists not only in USIS as we really saw, that exists in virtually every business we have, and what you just saw in EWS as well. So yeah I think now that they're over, I don't know the exact number for USIS, over 42% I think it was, yeah, you should expect them to fall in that range. And the only way John and I can give you our targeted 25 basis points of expansion every year, is that every business unit continues to grow. So I would expect USIS to continue to expand on mortgage as well. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI : Final question for me on capital allocation. What should we think about in the next year in terms of dividend growth given the elevated EPS growth that you showed in the first quarter? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, we're committed to that range that we talked about. And I think it was three years or four years ago, we established a new dividend policy, that 25% to 35% of our net income going back in the form of a dividend. So as we continue to grow our net income, you should continue to expect dividends to increase. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI : Thank you very much. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI : Thank you, David. Operator : Go to Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Greg Mrva - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, this is actually Greg calling on for Manav. Just wanted to dig in a little bit on the TDX contract with the UK government. Clearly, you guys sound pretty constructive about it. But was hoping to get some color both around the magnitude of the cost as you ramp up that contract and then how to think about the ramp up and the ultimate opportunity there? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Greg, thanks for joining. I'll talk specifically about TDX. What you can hear us talk about more in the future, is a debt services platform which is really integrating the capabilities we have and our Mexican acquisition is about the same timeframe called Infinix and then TDX, which is the UK-domiciled capability. So you'll hear us talk about kind of debt servicing platform versus TDX or Infinix going forward. Specific to the Her Majesty's contract, as I alluded to briefly in my comments, going as expected. We've overwhelmed this with people, with process. The timeline is tight. It was such a significant award that we had to make sure we got it right and we're getting it right. And hopefully, as we extend this technical environment up, this structure up, in the third quarter, we started to receive their first load of data in the third quarter. It takes you a while to analyze the data, understand the data, format the data, and then you pass the analytics on to the collection agencies across the country. So that's why I said you expect nominal amount of revenue in the 2015 year, maybe the very end of the fourth quarter, and then ramping up nicely in 2016. Greg Mrva - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And I guess along that same theme, during, post the acquisition, you talked a lot about bringing the TDX capabilities to new markets, whether it's the U.S. or Australia. Does this contract put that a little bit on the backburner or how are you seeing that progress right now? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : That's a great question. We drilled a little bit early on because the same teams that can the build the capabilities to deploy in different countries were concerned, we're getting the DMI contract up and running in the UK. However, I can tell you that they're moving full speed now in places like Canada. I was just in South America last week, met with clients in both Chile and Argentina, the interest level is extremely high, and the pipeline is very good. Things are going very well in Australia. And we mentioned before, things are going very well in Peru, Colombia. There is a strong interest in Brazil for the platform. So while we're distracted a little bit with DMI, that distraction is now behind. And we're moving full speed. Greg Mrva - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Go to Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Rick, I guess kind of a two-part question. One, from a big picture perspective, in terms of where we are in the credit cycle, I heard you mention a lot of consumer credit products save credit cards. So I wonder if you have a sense as to where you think we are as far as issuers ramping up their consumer credit card businesses. And then sort of as a corollary, you mentioned the shift in the way your customers are going to market. And I wonder how that dovetails with some of the newer credit modeling solutions that FICO is introducing around thin files and perhaps how that might open up sort of the next leg of growth in consumer credit cycle or whether you think it will at all? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Andrew. Two thoughts, one on the bank card issuance, what's going on there. Since the bank card issuance in the U.S. kind of hit the bottom, the market has rebounded at a rate of about 10% or so a year, so it's growing modestly, actually above modestly. However, it still remains significantly below the pre-recessionary levels. So improving, but nowhere close to where we were back in the pre-recessionary environment. And obviously, that improvement helps us. As far as FICO, as you know, the FICO business score, the thin score, thin file score you've alluded to is predicated largely upon our data and analyst data, a lot of data used in that model, is borrowing the data from our (36:01) data file on utilities and telcos. So as that product takes off, obviously we're the benefactor of that. Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Okay. Do you think from a macro perspective that the signals, the move towards thin file scoring and so forth signals sort of an opening up of the underwriting environment or is this more tactical or more incremental, I guess? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I think, it's more incremental. If you look at, take a proxy, the subprime bank card market, what you're seeing there is, yes, they're getting a little more aggressive in subprime lending, but the outstanding that loan limits, I should say, are extremely low. And so, while they're going a little more aggressive and obviously this thin file score will help them to be a little more aggressive, they're being very cautious on the limits they're applying to those bank cards. Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Okay. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : But obviously, anytime you get more people access to credit, and this score does that, we benefit by default. Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Sure. Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, you mentioned, you called out EGI as a driver. Could you just give a couple of examples? And I wonder if, you moved toward more of these Enterprise Solutions, that's helping your pricing overall. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, (37:32). Yeah. So Andrew, I think you may know a leader for us here \u2013 the guy's name is Andy Bodea, works for me, runs global operations, runs the global lean, global procurement. He is a great operator, a disciplined operator. He's got a great team around him. He started looking at this since, in earnest, maybe three years or four years ago and said, look at these large multimillion dollars, sometimes cross-business unit deals, you need more rigor to ensure our time-to-revenue is as expected much like we did in NPI. So Andy and his team have been doing this now for three years or four years. And we're doing stuff, I'll give you a couple of examples of where we are attacking EGI today, one is in automotive. And we're couple of years into that now, and we decided to get into automotive heavily. We leveraged EGI discipline to do so. Another, I alluded to EWF a few minutes ago was this compliance center, building up more capabilities, (38:29) and some others, and non-ACA Workforce Analytics, a whole suite of new products (38:37). We're doing some things in PSOL \u2013 re-platforming of PSOL's go-to-market. It definitively gives you exclusively pricing power? It definitely gives you revenue growth, which is a factor in our performance, as you've seen us exit 2014 and continue in 2015. And I think anytime you can build products to differentiate what you do versus your competition, it does add more value \u2013 the discussion goes away from pricing more to share gain you spend. Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Terrific, appreciate the color, nice job. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Thank you. Operator : We'll go to George Mihalos with Credit Suisse. George Mihalos - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Good morning guys and congrats on the quarter. Rick and John, just wanted to start off with, if we look at the first quarter, you did, I think, 14% constant currency organic revenue growth. The outlook for the second quarter, I think you're talking about 10% to 12% constant currency. Is there anything outside of any sort of variability on the mortgage side that would cause you to expect that deceleration, I guess, is there going on in the business that you think was sort of one-time in the first quarter or that is slowing a little bit as you go through the back half of the year outside of mortgage? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, it is specifically the second quarter, and then I'll come back to the balance of the year. There are two primary drivers when you look at sequential growth. And you hit one, George, which is the mortgage market. And the other is, I think I alluded to it in my comments, the WOTC contract, Workforce Opportunity Tax Credit contract, which we monetized in the first quarter this year, we did last year as well. It doesn't repeat. It's a one quarter \u2013 largely a one-quarter activity. That's the nuances, if you will, for the second quarter. And then for the balance of the year, the third quarter and fourth quarter, we look at growth rates here which are still very solid, I think you'd agree. It's really the uncertainty on a macro basis; interest rate environment, regulatory environment around the world, economic environment so on and so forth, geopolitical issues, and there's uncertainty there. That's about it. George Mihalos - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, great. I appreciate the color. And then as it relates to margins on international and the rollout of TDX there, it sounds like the contract will be somewhat fully ramped in the fourth quarter. I appreciate the commentary around margins in international for the year. But what is a good exit rate ending 2015 for international margins? I would imagine they would sort of spike up in the fourth quarter. Is that a fair way to think about it? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No. Because, as I alluded to, the data doesn't come in until third quarter. By the time we actually format it, analyze it and then start to distribute the data and analytics, it could be late fourth quarter. So I don't expect much revenue from that large contract. You got to understand the investment we've made in this business has been on two fronts; one is standing up DMI and the other is the typical stuff we invest when we acquire a company as security. That's compliance. We're in the process of applying for a license in UK for this organization, and so on and so forth. This makes (41:50). So this is a year of fairly heavy broad-based investment in TDX, also investment to bring it global into more countries. So as far as margin expansions for TDX specifically and then international, I expect modest improvement for international for this year, but then a more significant improvement as we go in 2016 because the level of spend comes down, the core TDX business continues to grow at strong double-digits, and the monetization of DMI. George Mihalos - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, great. And just last question for me, as it relates to the restructuring savings, the $10 million to $15 million, would you expect that to fully pass through in 2016 or is the expectation that you'll reinvest those savings in the business for accelerated growth? Thank you. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : John? John W. Gamble - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President : I would expect probably it's a combination of both, right. Some of it will pass through and then some of it we'll reinvest to try to accelerate growth in 2016 and 2017. So you're going to see a combination of both actions. George Mihalos - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, great. Thank you. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks. Operator : We'll go to Brett Huff with Stephens, Inc. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Good morning, Rick, John and Jeff. Congrats on a nice quarter. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Two questions. One, you mentioned EGI and there was a follow up question on it. Could you call out the contribution to growth kind of like you do for NPI this quarter or maybe recent history and is that accelerating? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : It's an interesting question. The answer is I'm not prepared to do that now, but let me give that some thought, Brett. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Because you're right, there are a lot of similarities. It's a systematic way to bring process discipline to growth... Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : ...much like NPI. So let me give it some thought. At a high level, I will tell you this. It is becoming a very meaningful number. It is contributing to our organic growth rate quarter in quarter out. Rather than just react here on the phone, let John give some thought to what's the best way to frame that up for you. But the one reason we didn't break it up for this call is because; one, we've been at it and we have some credibility internally in doing this for three years or four years now; and two, it's meaningful. So I'll come back to you. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. And second question is on PSOL there's been some strategic changes going on, specifically the Experian FICO deal. Have you seen changes in your PSOL business or consumer behavior around that? Do you think that FICO will become a more widely used standard of credit score in direct-to-consumer business for you all or other people, any thoughts on that? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. I think FICO is the brand when it comes to scoring in the U.S. today. So I think the thing that's changed for PSOL largely is three things : one, we now have good international platform versus a U.S. platform; two, with the acquisition of TrustedID a year and a half year or so ago that gives them a whole new area of focus for growth; and three, obviously is free thing we talked about. Free market is here to stay. So be that a FICO score or any other score, getting your score for free is here to stay. And as I mentioned in the last earnings call, Trey and his team and even (45:08) and his team from the USIS side are working diligently on figuring out how to best play there. And I always tell people that there's a different way to think about that, and if you look at one of our competitors who talks about their PSOL business, they're (45:26), if you will. We sell to partners. They aggregate in their PSOL business. That reflects a much different growth profile. So as I think about it, I don't really care if it comes through our USIS channel, which it does today, or if comes through PSOL, which it may in the future. That free market is here and it's clear we've got to have a great strategy around that and the team is developing that right now. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Thank you guys. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : We'll go to Jeff Meuler with Baird. Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yes. Thank you. So some of these numbers are baffling \u2013 bafflingly good to me. So I got to ask, how \u2013 and I know your targets are multi-year targets, but how frequently do you revisit if they're still the right targets or is it possible that maybe they are the right long-term targets, but within that framework you could still grow for several years above the upper ends of the targets. And I'm just asking given how strong enterprise selling is going, NPI, it seems like a lot of these things should have legs to them? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. When we give guidance or we give a multi-year framework, Jeff, we take that very seriously. So when John and I think it's prudent to revisit the multi-year framework and make any adjustments, you guys will be the first to know. But at this juncture, largely driven by, it has nothing to do with our ability to execute. The things you mentioned, D360, new product innovation, EGI, pricing all those things. I think you know Jeff, we've been at now for eight years, nine years, 10 years, and that's all organic as we talked about as well. So the only thing that's holding us back right now is macro uncertainty, and it's just too early to make any change on the model at this juncture. Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then the commercial business, I think you said it was the best Q1 since 2007. If you could help us understand what's driving that? Is it market or are you starting to see some of the benefits from move again into the USIS management? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Clearly it's the latter. You've heard me say before, leadership makes a difference. And that's now the responsibility of Rudy Ploder and then a guy within Rudy's team, we talked of before, he runs our KCP accounts, and a high potential guy in our company, Tom Madison. Those two gentlemen have brought focus and discipline and leveraging the USIS relationships. So leadership makes a difference and that's a great example. Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then on the guidance, John, if you could just help me understand the constant currency EPS growth was merely narrowed to the top end of the prior range, but the EPS figures that you're citing the top end of the guidance range was raised. I think currency got worse, not better, if you could just help me bridge that please? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Now, the currencies \u2013 this is Rick. So it's the same. We gave currency impact for the year of about $0.11 when we were together in February. And as I probably said in my comments, it's still $0.11 for the year. It's $0.09. The remaining $0.02 of it will occur in the first quarter. Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): So, why does the top end of the growth \u2013 constant currency EPS growth guidance range not go up, but the EPS figures that you're citing for the full year do go up at the top end of the range? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : They did go up. I think, speaking from memory, our last guidance was $4.20 to $4.30. Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Correct. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And we're now saying $4.28 to $4.35. Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yes. And I'll take one more swipe at it and then I'll follow up offline. But I think the constant currency EPS growth rates, the top end of that is still $0.14, correct? John W. Gamble - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President : $0.14 is what gave. Some of it's just rounding, right. But we did take it up a nickel. So we took the top-end of the guidance range up a nickel. Currency really hadn't changed much. So if you're seeing growth rate that look similar, it's simply rounding because a nickel on $4.30 isn't a huge percentage. Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : We'll go to Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, gents. I wanted to go back to debt collection, recovery management the way it is right now. Sure, I saw the comment of double-digit growth currently. I was wondering if you could just be a little more specific about what the current growth rate of that business is, what's the size of that business as we just anniversary TDX and Inffinix. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Andrew, I thought I mentioned in my comments, it was 25% growth in the first quarter and that's specific to TDX. Anyways, I expect it to be strong double-digit growth for the year as we talked about before and (50:16) traction. Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And how big is that business now? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I think we've given the number when we bought it. We didn't give. Jeff is shaking his head, no. It's becoming a very meaningful size business for us. Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. But it is still under $100 million of revenues, right? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Right. Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : We'll go to Paul Ginocchio with Deutsche Bank. Paul L. Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Rick, any way to size the contribution to growth in verification from WOTC? And also maybe just talk about the CMS contract, was that a benefit to OIS in the first quarter? And then finally, the new 15 million people who were going to be scored by the new JV you just announced with FICO and LexisNexis, does that 15 million, does that add roughly about 10% to the people in your credit database, and will those people use, you think, these active in credit as your existing people in the files? Thanks. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. The first one on the WOTC, I'm not sure I remember all three questions. First on the WOTC was, if you took the WOTC benefit out, the growth rate for all of EWS I think went from 24% to 21%. Paul L. Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. And number two \u2013 what the heck was number two, again? Paul L. Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: CMS. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Which CMS? The Medicaid & Medicare Services contract? Paul L. Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Correct. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And you said what benefits that had for EWS? Paul L. Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: No, no, for \u2013 yes, that's right for EWS. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. (51:48) Yes. I gave some numbers earlier on the last call, Paul. Last year we were slightly above the minimum contract and we expect to be up significantly from that in this year. That was number one. Number two, we talked about another big part, which is probably even bigger on the CMS mandate is the ACA workforce analytics stuff that we talked about, which will be up over 100% this year versus last year, and also adding a lot of \u2013 number of records to the database. So it's very important to us. Paul L. Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And will that up significantly that would coincide with enrollment growth in Obamacare? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, absolutely. Remember, last year they had all the issues with standing up the CMS websites. That's largely behind. The awareness is greater. The activity rate is much higher, so yes. Paul L. Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I mean just on how does the additional 15 million of people with the FICO JV you just announced, how much does that increase your current number of people with credit scores that you send credit reports on and will those people be as active? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, that is yet to be seen on the activity base. But the good thing is we're finding people who don't have a credit file, who have some payment behavior that seems positive that you can now introduce to telcos and banks and auto lenders to potentially give them credit. But the time will tell if in fact they have a credit activity that's like the rest of our customer base. My guess is no (53:22) time will tell. Paul L. Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : And we'll go Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. William Arthur Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, everyone, and I'll add my congratulations on a strong quarter. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Bill William Arthur Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : So a question for you on the U.S. government ID authentication work. If you could talk a little bit about how the volumes have been this year versus last, and also which government agencies you are currently serving and what the pipeline looks like for new ones? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. I mean I gave you a high-level overview in my comments that the fraud and (53:59) detection business which is much more than just the U.S. is growing strong double-digit for us, which is great. So if I think of specific to your questions where are we solving problems with the U.S. with fraud and ID prevention products, it is in SSA, it's in the IRS, it's in CMS, it's also a number of state agencies across the country, so it's broad based. And yes, the punch line there is, Bill, if I look at our three-year to five-year strategic plan and say what might look different three years to five years out, one of the areas we've talked about with you guys is a much larger, more impactful higher performing fraud and ID protection business, and that's why we dedicated some new resources when we structured that last year and it's just performing very well. William Arthur Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And then a question for you on Europe, very strong performance there, up 12% constant currency despite the sluggish economy. Is that share gains driving that growth? And if so, how you're taking share in what would normally be considered a fairly mature market? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. We've talked about this before. We've got a great leader who is an Argentine that worked for us across Latin America and then we moved him to Spain. He got Spain really on a great roll through the recession and post recession. And then we moved him and then it was Patricia Ramon (55:30) to the UK, sometime last year, continues to do a good job there. So it's the same dynamics you'd be seeing, Bill, around the world. It is innovation, it is focus on verticals that are important, just like insurance, government over there, and now collections. It is analytics, decision analytics platforms that we're deploying across multiple verticals in our European footprint. William Arthur Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you very much. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Jeffrey L. Dodge - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Okay. I'd like to thank everybody for their time, their support of the company. And with that, operator, we'll terminate the call. Have a good day. Operator : This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jeff Dodge. Please go ahead, sir. Jeffrey L. Dodge - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Jeff Dodge, Investor Relations. And with me today are Rick Smith, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com. During this call, we'll be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in the filings with the SEC, including our 2014 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. We will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax. It will be adjusted for certain items, which affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance. Adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes acquisition-related amortization expense and the associated tax effects, an impairment charge related to our cost-method investment in DBS and an income tax benefit generated from a state tax law change. These measures are detailed in our non-GAAP reconciliation tables included with our earnings release and also posted on our website. Also please refer to our various investor presentations, which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website, www.investor.equifax.com for further details. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Rick. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. Thanks, as always, for joining us this morning. By now, you've seen the results and I think you'd agree, our company continues to benefit from our unique and very diversified business model. Also benefits from our high-leveled execution costs, all the BUs, and the centers of excellences, and we continue to reap benefits from the new product innovation that we've launched back in 2006. For the quarter, both revenue and adjusted EPS exceeded the upper end of our guidance range for all four business units and they delivered revenue growth ahead of our expectations. This reflected both our continued execution of new products and market expansions as well as a stronger than expected U.S. mortgage market. Total revenue for the quarter was $678 million, up 10% on a reported basis and up 14% on a local currency basis from the second quarter of 2014. In the quarter, FX created a $19 million year-on-year headwind, up from the headwind we experienced in the first quarter, up $17 million. Operating margin for the quarter was 27.8%, up from 27.3% in the second quarter of 2014. Adjusted EPS was $1.15, up 20% from $0.96 a share last year and significantly above the upper end of our guidance range. As I always do, let me \u2013 before John gives you some financial details, I'll go through some of the business unit highlights, as well as some of the corporate highlights. And then, we'll go into the details of the financials with John. The power of our Decision 360 initiative which you by know are very well aware of, combined with our enterprise selling strategy and our mortgage market success, enabled USIS to once again deliver very strong broad-based 12% growth. Our recently launched data and analytics environment which we've introduced to you and we call it Cambrian has positioned us to develop and deliver new D360 products at speeds that once took weeks, now take us minutes. This is something you'll recall we've talked about now for probably two years and that is now fully in production in the U.S. and making a big difference. The primary goal of Cambrian is to source and integrate structured and unstructured data from any industry, anywhere in the world, and proactively deliver actual insights valued by our customers. What is particularly compelling is that we can now create transformational solutions by combining traditional trusted data with other Big Data sources in cutting edge analytical capabilities with greater ease and speed. Cambrian will help us discover new data assets through our research and/or our partnerships that will further broaden and deepen our portfolio of data assets and fuel new product innovation. Presently for Cambrian, the environment is focused on our U.S. based data assets and market opportunities, however, as we've talked in the past, we'll be developing significant domain expertise that will enable us to expand into our international geographies over the next 6 months to 12 months. Moving on, and in the auto vertical in the U.S., we recently launched the first of three products in the Power Lead suite which leverages our data assets to help auto dealers be more effective in their marketing activities. They leverage third-party service providers or connectors as we call them. We help dealers leverage their website performance by turning anonymous borrowers into known high quality leads. Consumers are now more empowered by getting their credit score online after being authenticated with our eID Verifier services, and all this information is with consumer authorization that's then shared with the dealers. Our partnership with Credit Karma I think we talked to you about that back in the very end of 2013, early 2014. That continues to be \u2013 is that right? 2014 and 2015, yeah, at the very end of 2014, sorry about that. That continues to be a very important revenue contributor to USIS and is off to a great start this year. We now expect the revenue in the relationship with Credit Karma for 2015 to expect \u2013 to exceed our original expectations. Staying in USIS, in the utility sector, we launched our \u2013 the first of our four markets, specific insight tools, leveraging third-party data alongside our credit information and our telco and utility database. These insights will help utilities optimize their deposit strategies to better manage and control portfolio loss rates. Our Commercial Solutions business within USIS, their product offerings in business unit had a very strong performance in the quarter with both accelerating revenue growth and improved operating margins when compared to the first quarter of the year. Mortgage origination activity exceeded our expectations for the quarter and driven by our strong market position, contributed nicely to USIS's growth and margin expansion. Our fraud and property valuation product offerings continued to deliver very strong double-digit growth in the mortgage market as well. We'll talk obviously in the Q&A more about mortgage and where we think that's headed. Finally, our partnership with Jumio which we've talked to you about in the past has secured its first mobile commerce authentication service with a major telco. The application includes validation of an end user's photo ID along with facial biometrics, a first for us. While we expect the mortgage growth to decelerate for the remainder of the year, we expect USIS to end 2015 with double-digit organic revenue growth and operating margins comfortably exceeding 40%. Let's move on to International. They continue to make very good progress on their critical strategic growth initiatives, including the integration of TDX, implementation of the UK government contract and continue to drive innovation through new products around the globe. Revenue in International's three largest verticals, which are the financial institutions, telcos and SMEs grew 13% for the quarter. The decisioning platforms, analytics services and debt management revenue grew 17% for the quarter. TDX delivered another quarter of 20% plus revenue growth, a trend we expect to continue as we move into the third quarter. Also we are in the process of entering the Canadian and Brazilian markets with TDX products and services. We're also meeting all of our operational readiness commitments within TDX or the UK contract that we've talked about in the past. Equifax data has been integrated into the TDX workflow for developing the consumer insights and appropriate collections strategies. The IT infrastructure build has been completed and security penetration testing is largely completed. 20 debt collection agency contracts have been signed after vetting with the UK government, and as we've mentioned to you in the past, we expect this to be operational late fourth quarter, early fourth quarter, modest revenue this year and ramping up nicely in 2016. Moving on to Latin America, we've identified opportunities to set up exchanges, much like we do in the U.S., where critical data assets are not currently available. We've already received regulatory approval in one country, and we'll be finalizing our plans by the end of the year. As you know, the exchanges have been very successful in the U.S. with good margins and good competitive differentiation, helping our customers in ways we couldn't help before. We're really excited about what this might bring us in this one country. If it's successful there, bring it across to other Latin American countries. In Canada, we launched a six-month pilot for an e-commerce site to provide online delivery for our business and consumer credit product offerings. This distribution channel will be very attractive to our SME customers, while also addressing a growing market demand in other verticals and potentially other geographies. And we recently signed a global agreement with a large, international telecom to create new analytical insights using telecom usage data. Ultimately the analytical insights will be sold to financial institutions, retailers, and other customers in our served markets to facilitate decisioning on consumers who have limited or no credit information. This partnership is significant for Equifax as a new source of rich data for consumers in Latin America, which is typically a negative data-only geography. We're starting with risk scores that are developed from our telecom data to address the pain point of FIN (10:42) file and no-hit at the point of acquisition. Over time, we'll expand this beyond account acquisition to other decisioning needs. For the full year, we expect the International revenue growth to be solidly in the upper end of their long-term growth range which is 7% to 10%. We continue to grow \u2013 invest in their long-term growth initiatives. On to Workforce Solutions; they again delivered an outstanding broad-based 23% revenue growth and a operating margin of 38.3% and they're doing a great job of executing with precision on their strategic objectives. Revenue from all of our Affordable Care Act initiatives continued to accelerate nicely. And with the recent Supreme Court decision, we anticipate continued strong demand for our product offerings in this area. Our ACA platform solutions, which enables companies to know the extent of their compliance with the Affordable Care Act, continue to benefit from very strong interest. We now have contracts with numerous employers, who in aggregate now have 10 million employees on their payroll. In June alone, we signed 62 new customer contracts. We're uniquely positioned to add value in the healthcare vertical and we will be making important investments to drive further long-term revenue growth and market penetration. The strong growth in Verification Services was driven by \u2013 continue to add records, new records to The Work Number database, also double-digit growth in mortgage originations, and continued penetration of non-mortgage market verticals. In the quarter, our non-mortgage market Verification revenue grew 21%, virtually every vertical were in strong double-digit for the quarter, outstanding performance. Growth in mortgage-related revenues decelerated in the second quarter, a trend that we \u2013 will continue \u2013 that will continue for the remainder of the year. However, Workforce Solutions success on many of their strategic initiatives should continue to drive very attractive revenue growth. For the full year, we now expect revenue growth to be in the upper teens with margin expansion over 2014 of at least 400 basis points to approximately 37%. On to PSOL, PSOLs growth exceeded our expectation, driven by double-digit growth in our indirect channels and our International segments, in addition to winning two breach contracts. Revenue growth for our direct-to-consumer activities in the U.S. continues to be driven by higher average revenue per subscriber and lower churn. They've done a great job on both ARPU and churn. PSOL is making good progress on their transformation efforts and we expect full year organic revenue growth to be at the upper end of the long-term range of 4% to 6% and operating margins for the full year solidly in the range of 25% to 30%. So again, before I go to John with the financial details, let me give you some highlights at the corporate level quickly. Some things we've talked about in the past that are very critical to our sustained organic growth. You've heard me talk about NPI 2.0 and you've heard me talk about EGI as critically important growth initiatives. In NPI 2.0, we've developed detailed metrics to better manage our pipeline of opportunities to more effectively allocate our resources and track our success on product launches, and to minimize time to revenue. Midway into the year, we are now 10% over our revenue target and so the team is doing a great job of executing again in NPI. Enterprise Growth Initiatives, we call it EGI, where we're focused on larger, more complex projects that frequently engage multiple parts of the organization but also have a much bigger impact on our revenue growth. EGI is delivering again 1 to 2 points of revenue growth annually for us. In Global Operations, that COE continues to make important contributions to our bottom line. Within the operations COE, you've heard us talk about LEAN initiatives which traditionally have been used internally. We've talked a lot about that. However, with the increased level of competition and regulatory requirements in many of our industry verticals, there are many new opportunities for incremental revenue growth when we leverage LEAN within our customers operations. Our global LEAN teams now are currently engaged with over 20 great customers, helping to drive operational improvements that are critical to their success while adding yet another element of differentiation for our business in the marketplace. So our customers become stronger, more efficient and it helps us differentiate versus competition and secure incremental revenue. On to our fraud and identity management business, they're presently broadening to incorporate biometrics in mobile device resolution via partnerships. We're also looking to taking on more successful products and launching them in other geographies. It's a practice we've done in other parts of the business. Now we're intentionally taking fraud and ID products from one part of the world to other geographies where it makes sense. In summary, the business is off to a solid start this year with high levels of execution across many of our strategic initiatives and we're well down the path of changing Equifax from a credit bureau into a truly diversified information solutions company. Our domain expertise and analytics and technology enables us to increasingly deliver powerful insights to our customers and enhance their decision making. All of our business units continue to work hard to deliver on their commitments to the company, our customers, employees and shareholders. And as we move into the second half of 2015 and start to look at 2016, I strongly believe the prospects for consumer credit and the developed markets in which we operate, especially the U.S. look very good. The dynamics are shaping up as a sweet spot now for consumer credit growth. And with that, let me turn over to John for the financials. John? John W. Gamble - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President : Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As before I'll be referring to the financial results from continuing operations generally presented on a GAAP basis. During the quarter we recorded an impairment charge of $14.8 million or $9.8 million after-tax related to our cost method investment in DBS. The impairment is in general a result of the weakened economic situation in Brazil. We also recorded an $8.6 million after-tax gain due to a state income tax benefit resulting from a state tax law change enacted during the quarter. The net of these two unusual items was negative $0.01 per share. Consistent with our past practice for treating unusual or infrequent items, we've excluded these items from our adjusted EPS in order to provide investors with a more consistent period to period operating comparison. Now let me turn to the business unit's financial performance for the second quarter. U.S. Information Solutions revenue was $360 million up 12% when compared to the second quarter of 2014. Online Information Solutions revenue was $233 million up 13% when compared to the year-ago period. Mortgage Solutions revenue was $33 million up 20% compared to Q2 of 2014, this compares favorably to the mortgage bankers application index which was up 16% in the second quarter. Financial Marketing Services revenue was $50 million up 4% when compared to the year-ago quarter and the operating margin for U.S. Information Solutions was 42.1% up from 39.5% in the second quarter of 2014. International revenue was $148 million down 1% on a reported basis, but up 11% on a local currency basis. By region, Europe's revenue was $63 million down 1% in U.S. dollars but up 12% in local currency. Latin America's revenue was $51 million up 6% in U.S. dollars and 18% in local currency. Canada revenue was $35 million down 10% in U.S. dollars, but up 2% in local currency. For the second quarter, International's operating margin was 19.9% down from 21.9% in the second quarter of 2014. Although the operating margin fell short of our expectations, we have a number of very exciting growth opportunities Rick has discussed that were an incremental investment and management focus. Workforce Solutions revenue was $146 million for the quarter up 23% when compared to the second quarter of 2014. Verification Services with revenue of $94 million was up 30% when compared to the same quarter of last year. Employer Services revenue was $52 million up 11% compared to last year, growth was aided by our ACA analytical solution and further progress with Compliance Center. The Workforce Solutions operating margin was 38.3%, compared to 33.9% in Q2 of 2014. Personal solutions revenue was $68 million, up 7% on a reported basis and up 8% on a local currency basis. For the second quarter, operating margin was 27.6% compared to 30.9% in Q2 of 2014. This margin is consistent with our longer term expectation for this business, as we primarily driven by increased marketing expense during the quarter. In the second quarter, general corporate expense at $48.5 million was slightly over the guidance we gave last year. The increase versus our guidance, and from the $36.6 million in 2Q of 2014, was principally due to increased incentive compensation expense due to our very strong performance in 2015. We also had increased salaries and benefits, and other investment expense, primarily related to our key strategic initiatives. Looking at the third and fourth quarter, we expect general corporate expense to be approximately $45 million per quarter, consistent with 2014 levels. Operating margin at 27.8% was very strong. Operating cash flow was $187 million in the quarter. We continued our aggressive stock buyback activity, repurchasing 0.9 million shares for $92 million and paying $34 million in dividends to our shareholders. With that I'll turn it back to Rick. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, John. Consistent with our guidance last quarter, we expect continued favorable economic conditions in the U.S. span the majority of our non-mortgage verticals. I'll talk about mortgage in a second. Internationally, we continue to expect uneven economic conditions across Europe and Latin America. Our view of the U.S. mortgage market in the second half of 2015 is roughly consistent with our prior guidance as we expect U.S. mortgage market originations to be up slightly in the second half of 2015 versus the same period of 2014. We are, however, increasing our full-year view for 2015 mortgage originations to be up somewhere between 11% and 13% versus 2014. The U.S. mortgage market was stronger than our expectations in the first half of the year with originations up approximately 20% versus last year. And again, we'll talk about the nuances and the impact of moving from a refinancing mortgage market to a purchase market, which we are in the process of doing, the benefits that has for our company. For the third quarter, we expect organic revenue to be between $655 million and $670 million, reflecting constant currency organic growth between 10% and 12%, partially offset by about 3% FX headwind. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.08 and $1.11 a share, which is up 7% to 10%, excluding $0.03 per share of negative impact from FX. This reflects constant currency organic EPS growth of 10% to 13%. We also expect operating margin to be in the range of 27% to 27.5% for the quarter. For the full year, we've again increased our guidance for revenue and adjusted EPS. We expect now 2015 revenue to be between $2.645 billion and $2.67 billion, up from our previous guidance which was $2.585 billion to $2.635 billion and reflects constant currency organic revenue growth of 11% to 12% for the year. This strong revenue growth is partially offset, again, by approximately 3% negative FX impact. And as before, this is all organic revenue growth. 2015 adjusted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $4.38 to $4.42 a share, also up from our previous guidance and this reflects 13% to 14% EPS growth for the year. On a constant currency basis excluding $0.10 per share negative impact of FX at current rates, this reflects 15% to 16% growth for the year compared to 11% growth in 2011. In summary, we're also more intently focused now on strategic inorganic growth as we have developed a more robust pipeline of potential opportunities, now that we have fully integrated TDX into our operations. So as we've talked to you in the past, intent was to be more focused on that as we exit 2015 and into 2016, we're ready to do just that. So that's all the prepared comments. So, operator, if you could please open up for Q&A for John and I, that would be great. Operator : Certainly. We'll go first to Andre Benjamin at Goldman Sachs. Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Good morning. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. John W. Gamble - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President : Good morning. Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I was hoping to maybe dig a little bit more into Verification. I didn't know if you would be able to provide any color on how much of the revenue is coming from your success penetrating autos versus the ACA contract which has been ramping nicely versus other verticals? And if there are any others, maybe a little bit of color on where you're seeing the most traction? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. As I briefly alluded to in my comments, the trends we saw emerging in 2014 and clearly into the first quarter of 2015 are continuing. It is extremely broad-based. So think about the growth, first and foremost on the Verification side being, as we continue to add records, that's all incremental revenue right there and they've been adding records for a long time now. Secondly, Mortgage obviously is strong. Third as I alluded to in my comments, almost every \u2013 in fact I think it is every non-mortgage vertical is growing strong, strong double digits. That's pre-employment, that's collections, that's automotive, that's card, I can go on and on and on, extremely strong. And then as you mentioned the Workforce Analytics, we continue to add customers there, I said 10 million. Consumers are now being or employees are now being monitored and 62 clients alone in the month of June. So it is as broad-based a performance of growth as you could hope for in EWS. It is just spectacular. Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And then in the indirect channel you mentioned the Credit Karma relationship continues to ramp and contribute nicely. One, are you willing to disclose any amount that that is actually contributing? And two, as that seems to be performing a little bit better than you expected, how are you thinking about the potential to aggressively push to work with other partners? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Great question. It's still early, so we gave you a number earlier in the year, it's ahead of that right at this juncture, but we still have 6 months in the year to go. So it's hard to say where that goes for the full year at this time. It's been very successful. We like the model and as we've talked to you in the past, we look at that deed to see be it through a business to a consumer or direct-to-consumer as one unified strategy. So in this particular case we have our PSOL unit and USIS working together strategically to make sure this makes sense not just short-term but long-term. And, yes, there's nothing to prevent us from looking at taking the success we've had with Credit Karma and either doing it ourselves directly or doing it with other indirect players. Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Operator : And we'll go next to Jeff Meuler at Baird. Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah. Thank you. I guess one of the things that jumped out to me, Rick, is even getting out to Q3 as you start anniversarying the mortgage weakness, still guiding to 10% to 12% constant currency growth. And as you talk about the business, it sounds like almost every business unit is at or above the long-term guidance ranges. So is there anything that is unsustainable in the growth rate? Or said another way, when you're in the sweet spot of the consumer credit cycle in some of the larger developed markets, can you sustainably grow above the longer-term targets? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : That's obviously something we'll develop over time. It's something we keep a close eye on, Jeff. It depends on the horizon you're looking at. It's specific to the third quarter guidance, maybe the second half guidance. You're right, it's not just every business unit, it's the sub-business units within those business units, and the sub-sub. So that could be the auto vertical within International, but also the auto vertical within all the countries in International performing extremely well is very, very broad-based and their executions at extremely high level. Let me use your question to respond to something I briefly alluded to in my comments, which is the nuances of mortgage and how mortgage impacts our thinking for the balance of the year and next year. And you guys know this as well as we do, the world is going, the U.S. market is going from a heavily refinancing distribution to now back to more the normal distribution, which is heavily skewed towards purchases and less and less towards refinancing. And while the overall mortgaging market will soften, I think it clearly is going to soften second half of this year versus the first half, 2016 will be less than \u2013 maybe modestly up from 2015. The nuance that's positive for us is that when you go from a refinancing market to a home-purchase market, it's actually a benefit. In many cases, individual bank policies may not require them to pull a VOE/VOI: verification of employment, verification of income. When you do a purchase, they pull a VOE/VOI. Secondly, when you go to a refinancing, from refinancing to purchase, you're going to pull, as we've told you in the past, far more credit files. Your broker may pull the credit file; you, as a consumer, may shop the four different banks, five different banks, each time pulling a file. In refinancing, you don't do that. They may pull one file. So even though the mortgage market growth rates will slow as we go forward, including in third quarter, we think there's some hidden gems in there for us as you rebalance to a purchase market. John W. Gamble - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President : Also, as you do the math on the full year, since we've given you full-year guidance and guidance for the third quarter, as you back into the fourth quarter, what you see is our revenue growth rates, on a constant-currency basis, are moving back down toward our long-term averages. Right? Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Fair enough. And then I know NPI 2.0 is still a little bit early, but are you seeing signs that you're going to get more, call it, extra-base hits out of the NPI 2.0 products? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Clearly. I alluded to that, I think, in my comments that we had exceeded our budget by 10% for the quarter. But it's that combined with the topic we've talked about now for a few quarters, which is Cambrian. You can't underestimate; this has been a multi-year heavy investment that now gives us the ability to partner with our customers and build products in seconds, where it used to take weeks or months, and that fuels NPI as well. Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Got it. Thank you and hats off to you and the broader team. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you very much. Operator : We'll take our next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum at Stifel. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Hey, Rick, I was wondering if you could, if not quantitatively, maybe qualitatively talk a little bit about the volume, the growth that's in USIS. Maybe where you're getting tailwinds or how much you can attribute to tailwind from the end markets, which you've talked about, is getting better? And how much more just some of the initiatives that you've been very aggressive about for like, besides the Credit Karma, there is also things like fraud initiatives, ID identification and other things out there? So I guess how much is market versus how much is you guys just trying to anticipate where the best places are to be? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good question. I think there's no single answer. I'd say, generically, in the U.S. and I think I said this somewhere in my comments, we're expecting improved economic environments. I talked about moving to a sweet spot in consumer credit as you exit this year and go into 2016. It's not robust yet in the U.S.; it's improving. The nuance or the difference there would be the automotive, obviously very strong and we've benefited from that. But we've also benefited \u2013 we're growing at rates multiples of the automotive growth rates as you know, Shlomo, through our Connector Strategy, which we're partners, and new product introduction. Card, we're seeing pre-screen pick up, which is encouraging, and that should lead to more card revenue going forward. Insurance is strong, retail banking is strong. So it's fairly broad-based. But the heart of your question is other than automotive, the majority of the USIS growth that we're experiencing is not \u2013 some of it's economically driven, but more of it's driven by new product innovation, more spend with our customers, leveraging D360, things like that, versus the market itself. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's what I'm getting at. So your sense is that it's being in the right places and the initiatives that you guys have put forward versus just the rising tide lifting all boats? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And I think the rising tide will lift all boats eventually, but yes. We've been at D360, for god's sake I think it's in 2007, so eight years. And all the things we've done by leveraging D360, then building Cambrian, building NPI, it's those things by and large that are driving more of our core organic growth in the U.S. than it is the economic environment. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. And then just turning to International, clearly top line growth and the ability to drive the top line is the key. Can you talk about the things that impacted the margin that are really longer term efforts that you're making towards driving that top line growth? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, absolutely. It's consistent with what we've talked about before. There's two big things we're doing. And one, the beauty is, Shlomo, before I give you the two things we're doing, is John and I have the luxury to invest in areas where we need to invest, and PSOL is one of them. We've been investing in that for a couple of years as an example. We told you we'll accelerate the growth there from our competitors, but the margins will come down 25% to 30%. We also told you we're going to invest in International for long-term growth and profitability. We can do those things and still give you \u2013 we've told you what we're going to do, which is a 25 basis point to 50 basis point corporate margin expansion. We've done that and I think margins were up 120 basis points in the first quarter and 50 basis points in the second quarter. Specific to your question, though, there are two things we're investing in, in International, which I firmly believe benefit us long term. One is the government contract we talked about in the UK. That is a large, complicated investment that we've had to make that's required resources from around the globe to stand up this environment to be ready to go live end of the third quarter, early fourth quarter. And I think we've talked to you about that now as a group for a few quarters. So that's one. The other has been with our ability now to standardize platforms, we're now going to regional centers in International, and there's a cost associated with moving from replicating processes in every country to regionalizing those processes in fewer countries. So there's an investment required to get this. Those are two things we're investing in now as well as NPI, but we always do that. That will bode well long-term, but create some headwinds in margin short-term. John W. Gamble - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President : And just near-term, what you're seeing in the first half of this year is we just have a revenue mix change, right? We talked about Canada being a little weaker, a lot of it because of FX. There's an FX impact, but also, Canada is a very high-margin country for us, similar to USIS. So when Canada is weaker, it affects our International margins. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Great point. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. Last one, just if I can squeeze in. Hey John, how much more can you squeeze out of these DSOs? You have pretty healthy DSO. They continue to trend down. Is there really room to go over there when I think about cash flow, or how should I think about that? John W. Gamble - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President : That continues to be an area of focus. Obviously, a lot of that's driven by mix as well. DSOs internationally are a bit higher, and since you've seen pretty good local currency growth internationally, that does negatively impact DSOs. But it's something we continue to focus on and, obviously, we'll hope to squeeze them down over time. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Paul Ginocchio at Deutsche Bank. Paul L. Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks for taking my question. Just the 62 contracts in ACA analytics, how does that relate to the total contracts? And then just on the acquisitions, I would assume you're focused on more consumer data than, say, industrial data. Are you looking for tuck-ins, or you're thinking about doing \u2013 is there something larger out there or are you ready for larger deals if they're available? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Paul. Thank you. I can't recall \u2013 does anyone here recall the number of contracts we signed in EWS? Hold on, I'm looking at the guys; we're getting different -we have \u2013 Jeff, what's the number? Jeffrey L. Dodge - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Over 200. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : 462. Jeffrey L. Dodge - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : 462 by the end of the year. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And 62 signed, and he's saying \u2013 how many contracts have we already signed year-to-date? Okay. I'm being told, Paul, because I don't have it off the top of my head, over 200. So 62 in one month is a big number. Paul L. Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And the second question on acquisitions, thank you, team, for your great work there. On acquisitions, yeah, probably not sure I can disclose the details, but yeah, we do a good job of tuck-ins. So it would fit our strategy, which is data analytics, geographical expansion, and I'll leave it at that. Paul L. Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll move next to Gary Bisbee at RBC Capital Markets. Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi, guys. Good morning. Just a question on Workforce Solutions, and particularly the work number. It's obviously been a terrific asset as you've built out the database and expanded the end markets that that data's used in. How much runway's left on each of those strategies? And I guess, looking at the \u2013 outside of mortgage, which can move around, you've seen pretty steady acceleration in that over the last year. What could slow the non-mortgage growth there as we think over the next year? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Gary. Let me regress for a second, since I think we now have the actual data for Paul's question. Paul, on the Workforce Analytics, contracts signed last year was 244 for the total year 2014, ramping up nicely. It'll probably be more than that this year and 62 within the month of June alone. Gary, back to your question, what's driving and how sustainable is the non-mortgage growth in EWS, was that the heart of your question? Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah, just the work numbers seem to have gained a lot of momentum in the last year, that... Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : ...and what's the runway on that? How sustainable is it? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Very sustainable. Dann has done a hell of a job taking a very good business and bringing it to a new level. When we told you, we talked about this for quite some time, we have a path to get the records up to 300 million and every time you add a record, you get multiple bites of the apple, it becomes more valuable for more verticals. You have revenue added just incrementally for that record being added. So that's one. Two, Workforce Analytics are in the very early stages. The IRS piece of the Workforce Analytics goes live in February of 2016. So we haven't even experienced that revenue growth yet. The non-verification piece of EWS, we've got a great leader in there doing a great job of thinking. That business no longer is just protecting the work number but innovating, investing in efficiency for our customers and making the customer experience better, taking that business from virtually a no growth to a nicely growing business. So as I look, Gary, at the portfolio of assets we have, I have told our investors this time and time again, I think they're all really well positioned for long term multi-year growth. The one that's got I think the most significant growth opportunities over a multi-year period of time is in fact EWS. Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And given that, I guess, what are the prospects to try to begin to build something like the Work Number in other countries? It seems like it's been such a home run that I realize it probably would take years, but is that something that's on your radar? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Clearly. Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thank you. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yep. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Manav Patnaik of Barclays. Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, good morning, guys. Obviously there's a lot of good internal initiatives, like you said, driving a lot of that organic growth. I just wanted to touch on your comments on we're entering the sweet spot of the credit cycle. Can you give us some reference from your experience how long that cycle can last? What are some of the signs to look for in terms of how well that's progressing? Maybe just a little bit of color on that. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, sure. I'll give you my view, but there's others, economists that we obviously deal with that could give you their view, banks will give you their view. But here's why I described it that way. I intentionally described it in our larger developed markets, so the UK, Canada and U.S. I underlined or underscored particularly the U.S. What you've got is the emergence of obviously higher employment rates or unemployment rates starting to see wage growth, starting to see home price growth, continued home price growth, consumer confidence is growing. The banks are stronger now than they have ever been, so their ability to lend to those that want to borrow is as strong now, is becoming as strong now as it's been since maybe the 2005, 2006, 2007 timeframe. So that's why I'm saying I feel like in those countries specifically we're moving into what I view as a sweet spot for consumer credit. Obviously that benefits us. Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then just in terms of \u2013 Rick, we always talk about the NPI and the aspirations have obviously continued to push that goal up. It sounded like obviously even though this quarter at least significantly exceeded your expectations. Can you \u2013 I think in one of the previous questions you said momentum looks like it should continue. But, real preliminary looking into 2016, do you still think you guys will continue this momentum and do the above average growth you guys have been doing? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Emphatically, yes, and it's not just NPI 2.0, but it's something I think we introduced to you and I alluded to today, can't remember when we introduced it, Jeff, but the EGI, Enterprise Growth Initiatives, you can't underestimate that as well. And that's adding one or two points of growth annually for us on top of what we get from NPI. So it's a combination of those two is truly in our DNA and doesn't mean we've become complacent about it, but now we've got to continue to make sure we reinvigorate it, reinvent it, that's why we took a timeout and introduced 2.0, and that's why we introduced EGI maybe three or four years ago is we've always got to challenge ourselves of finding different ways to innovate for our customers. John W. Gamble - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President : And with that success that helps us be confident in the 6% to 8% organic growth model that we continue to focus on. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : That's a lot. Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Again, just last one. Is there any update to the TDX UK contract? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, I gave a few brief highlights. It's moving along very well. We still have the technical environment. We've cleared almost every operational hurdle that the government has asked for and we expect to go live \u2013 I think our first data feed is this week, next week, and really start going live late third quarter and into early fourth quarter. Really consistent with what we talked about maybe nine months ago, modest revenue in the fourth quarter and ramping up nicely in the first quarter 2016. Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. Thanks a lot, guys. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to Bill Warmington at Wells Fargo. William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, everyone. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. John W. Gamble - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President : Good morning. William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : So for PSOL, what's going on in the affinity business? And that market's been quiet for years, but now it's coming back to life. Why is that and are you guys participating in that? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I'm looking at it. It's starting to come back. It's a \u2013 we're not as heavily focused in the affinity market as others are. We're heavily focused in the indirect market and I think I alluded to in my earnings notes that that's growing strong double digits for us, but we're not a heavy player in the affinity market. William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah? Well then in \u2013 back in April you announced a new version of the FICO score that you see. NCTUE data helped generate a FICO score for consumers that didn't have sufficient data in their credit files to do a traditional FICO score. So how is that pilot going and does it have a chance to become a meaningful contributor to revenue for you some day? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I think so. It's early days, but I think any time we can help our customers, be it banks or telcos, get transparency and better insights into the under-banked they win, the under-banked win and we win. I alluded to the fact, in one of the Latin American countries we're building capabilities with an exchange at transparency in that exact segment. There is nothing to do with the FICO score that you're talking about, leveraging on utility database. But it's the same concept, how to get transparency to the under-banked? And I think if we do that smartly, and the FICO score is one way to do that, again that's a win-win-win. William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Excellent. Thank you very much. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Andrew Steinerman at JPMorgan. Andrew C. Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, Rick, you chose to highlight you feel good about 2016. I just wanted to make sure I got the revenue movers, the needles that you could see right now at this point that influence 2016? So what I picked up was your view on the strengthening consumer credit application environment, the UK government contract ramping with in-depth placement and obviously the multiyear pass for Workforce Solutions. Are there any other drivers that you see today that influences your 2016 view? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, I'll give you \u2013 so, it's a continuation of all things we do, which is NPI, EGI, LEAN operational excellence of execution, blah, blah, blah. But the macro things, yes. a healing U.S. economy moving us into the sweet spot of consumer credit, and same with the UK, same with Canada, the TDX contract as you alluded to as well, and then EWS continue to go through ACA. Andrew C. Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : All right. And if you would just call out a vertical for 2016 that you feel like is strengthening, what vertical do you feel has the ability to break out in 2016? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I'd say that management obviously with the addition of a government contract in UK and I'd say Workforce Analytics clearly will be another big step up. Auto, I think the market in the U.S. auto market will be modestly up versus this year, but I think there's still another year of great growth prospects for us as we continue to mature with our strategy there. So those are a couple. Andrew C. Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. I appreciate it. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Operator : Next we'll go to David Togut at Evercore ISI. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC : Thank you. Good morning, Rick and John. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hello, David. John W. Gamble - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President : Hello. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC : I apologize. I joined the call a few minutes late. But, did you disclose, Rick, the number of active Work Number records? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No. I did not. I talked \u2013 someone asked the question, David, I can't recall who it was. I apologize for that, but \u2013 about Work Number, and I talked about long-term growth and we have a path and a strategy to get our total records to 300 million, David, maybe about a year or two ago. I've intentionally talked less about the active \u2013 that's growing nicely by the way. It's growing very nicely and on path to do everything we want it to do. But I'm talking more about this path, the 300 million records, because there was a misnomer that I feel maybe eight years ago with EWS in that there was more value or perceived value in active versus total. We derive a lot of value from the historical records as well. So in an attempt to make sure everyone understood that, we're really talking about getting the total database up to 300 million. We're on our way. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC : Understood. And then just shifting gears, you talked about Credit Karma a little bit. What experience have you had in up selling from the indirect channel, higher value-added Equifax services? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Within PSOL or within Credit Karma? David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC : Well, from the Credit Karma relationship specifically. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Very little. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Is that \u2013 yeah... Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : That's an opportunity long-term. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Is that difficult to do? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, it just hasn't been a priority yet. It's just getting the relationship understood, stood up and running, but it's something the team can look at long-term. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC : Understood. And a quick final question. Longer term thoughts on Brazil and how your relationship with Boa Vista will evolve? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good question. Thank you for asking that. Medium term, I know your question was long-term, medium-term, whatever the hell that means, I'm bearish on Brazil. Politically, economically, it's in a down cycle. I'm not sure if that's another two years, three years, but it's tough. Secondly, there's \u2013 I think everyone knows there was a law passed a couple years ago to include positive data, which we thought was a positive, no pun intended there. There's a cloud over that possibility. It is likely or possible that the positive bureau was in fact controlled and built by the banks, much like Serasa \u2013 if you remember Serasa of old, on the negative data it was built. So I'm not sure strategically what that does to the Brazilian market long-term. So right now, I've always said before I get aggressive in doing this, step up my \u2013 our ownership in Brazil, I've got to really understand what the economy is going to do and how long is it going to be in this downtrodden environment, and where does the positive bureau go. And I think we have clarity on the latter, the positive bureau, probably in the next 12 months, and we'll make a decision at that point in time. In the meantime, they're good partners. TMG is a good partner, Boa Vista is a good partner. We continue to work with them to make sure they are as successful as possible. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC : Understood. Thank you very much. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Brett Huff at Stephens Inc. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: You talked a little bit about EGI and I think it's the first time you've called out maybe 1 or 2 points of growth from that. And I was \u2013 it seems like that that was more than in my mind, that that might be contributing. And I guess I have a two-part question. One is, when you're sort of duking it out for wallet share with the other bureaus and the other relevant players, what's helping you win in that relationship? Is it just the long-term relationship? Is it the incremental unique datasets you have, et cetera? And then, number two, what takes that to the next level? Is it just execution and going through just systematically each of your top 50 customers or whatever it is? Or is there another gear in EGI that helps us even accelerate from 1 to 2 points. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Brett. I'd say, one, we've got good competitors and I respect our competitors. They do a good job in the marketplace and we got D&B (53:20) or Experian or local competitors in local countries. Two, you can't underestimate the power of having good people and we've been blessed to have some really good, talented, committed people. Then beyond that, I'd say there's no doubt that innovation, be it through EGI or NPI really leveraged by unique data assets has been a huge differentiator over the years. And I tell people that the growth in that area of innovation isn't always or even largely share gain. It is, in some cases, clearly, Brett. But it is solving problems that no one else can solve. So if they used to spend $100 in the ecosystem, if they're now spending $110, we get the incremental $10 spend. That's really where the great leverage is. And then, the other thing is \u2013 where was I going to go. Cameron (54:20) obviously will be an enabler long-term for us, so beyond that, how do you sustain that? I think it's sustainable mid-term and long-term, as I mentioned to someone else's question earlier. We've got to continue to reinvent ourselves, remain contemporary. I think we've also got to say what is the next asset we need that adds value to our customers that are our competition or the marketplace is not adding today. So in our strategic planning process, we always think about what is next. Obviously, I would not allude to that here, but that's something we think about. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Great. That's what I needed. Thanks for your time. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Brett. Operator : And we'll move next to Gary Bisbee at RBC Capital Markets. Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi, just one quick follow-up. Given the momentum in the ACA compliance offering, do you feel like all companies, or the vast majority of companies, you are trying to get that together this year and then you've got a much tougher comp for that next year? Or is this going to be a multi-year thing where you broaden out the analytics and are able to sell into that customer base? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, clearly multi-year. I mean, people are going to get \u2013 I can promise you this, the majority of companies, when we talk to CEOs, we've talked to the chief HR officers, they're thinking about this today and they're either looking to us or someone else in the marketplace to solve those problems or they're trying to build their own homegrown solutions, and if they're out of compliance, they're going to get fined. As those fines start to mount their need for solutions go up and the urgency for the solutions go up. Secondly, I alluded, Gary in my comments that the IRS piece of the compliance goes live February of next year, so we haven't even monetized that yet to its fullest extent. So I think if it's a baseball analogy, the Workforce analytics potential is in the very early innings of its growth. Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thank you. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn it back over to management for any closing remarks. Jeffrey L. Dodge - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : I want to thank everybody for their time and their interest and their support of Equifax. And with that, we'll conclude the call. Have a good day. Operator : And that does conclude today's conference. Again, thank you for your participation.",

Paul L. Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Operator : Good day and welcome to the Equifax Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Dodge. Please go ahead, sir. Jeffrey L. Dodge - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks and good morning, everyone. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Jeff Dodge, Investor Relations. And with me today are Rick Smith, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com. During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our core business are set forth in the filings with the SEC, including our 2014 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted operating margin. It will be adjusted for certain items, which affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance. For the third quarter of 2015, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excluded acquisition-related amortization expense, income from the settlement of certain escrow amounts and an accrual for certain legal claims. Adjusted operating margin excludes the accrual for certain legal claims. In fourth quarter of 2015 and 2016, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax will also exclude due diligence, transaction and integration cost related to the proposed acquisition of Veda Group. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in the reconciliation tables included with our earnings release and also posted on our website. Also please refer to our various investor presentations, which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website for further details. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Rick. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. As always, thank you for joining us this morning. Our strong first half momentum continued throughout the third quarter with very solid broad-based growth across most of our key market segments and countries. The momentum, combined with solid execution from the team and one of the deepest NPI pipelines we've had in all the past 10 years, positions us well as we move into the fourth quarter and in 2016. And in my comments later on this morning, I'll give you further look at both the fourth quarter as we always do and 2016 as well. The Equifax's strategy is clearly resonating well with our customers. Our core disciplines and new product innovation, LEAN, IT simplification, regulatory compliance and talent assessment are enabling stronger, more consistent execution across all of our initiatives. For the quarter, total revenue was $667 million, up 9% on reported basis and up 12% on local currency basis from the third quarter of 2014. And it was at the high end of our guidance. In the quarter, FX created a $22 million year-over-year headwind, up from the second quarter headwind, which was $19 million. Adjusted operating margin was 27.2%, up nicely from 26.4% in the third quarter of 2014. Adjusted EPS was $1.14, up 13% from $1.01 last year and above the upper end of our guidance range that we provided back a few months ago. As always, before John gives you the financial details, I'd like to briefly cover some of the key highlights for the third quarter. USIS has continued to power forward with 12% revenue growth and had a robust pipeline and opportunities to provide continued unique insights incorporating our multiple data assets. USIS delivered very solid broad-based growth in fraud and identity management solutions and commercial information. Both those business units were up double-digit versus 2014. Mortgage, direct-to-consumer and automotive were also very strong growth drivers for the quarter. And like the rest of the company, USIS is also benefiting from broad-based growth from NPI and our enterprise growth initiatives. Little more on NPI, there are four strategic levers to USIS efforts around new product innovation. They are : one, accelerating growth by linking most relevant data with expanded analytic capabilities; two, investing in vertical expertise to drive unparalleled insights; three, focusing on customer experience through optimized enterprise distribution; and four, diversifying portfolio growth across the value chain. An interesting point is that almost 60% of the anticipated three-year NPI revenue is focused on opportunities beyond the more traditional credit risk solutions that you know us for. Finally, this week, we announced a very exciting opportunity with Fannie Mae. You may have read that. Fannie Mae will begin incorporating Equifax trended data in addition to our verified employment and income from The Work Number database. The trended data provides new insights to lenders by expanding the credit information to aid their assessment of risk using updated analytical tools. Integrating The Work Number into Fannie Mae's underwriting system will make the process simpler for consumers and reduce the potential for fraud. We believe this will be a win-win for the consumers as well as the mortgage industry. There's some work to be done on our side and, as a result, the revenue opportunity is expected to start sometime in the second or third quarter of next year. It will be a nice impact for both USIS and EWS. USIS is having an outstanding year in 2015. For the full year, we expect them to deliver double-digit organic revenue growth and operating margins comfortably exceeding 40%. On to International, they delivered 14% local currency revenue growth, leveraging the diversity in its core customer verticals, new product innovation and unique platforms in decisioning, fraud, and debt management. As you know, we are now in the midst of starting up the UK government project that we've talked to you about now for a few quarters. We have provided Equifax consumer data to one government agency and have now received approximately \u00a3265 million of past-due receivables that we're now loading and analyzing and will soon move on to the collection agencies. As we have mentioned before, we expect nominal revenue growth in the fourth quarter of this year, but we expect that to ramp up nicely in 2016. In summary, as it relates to that project, it is on track, on pace, and meeting our expectations. In addition, we are currently exceeding our expectations with the TDX business in places like Australia and we're launching that platform across many other countries throughout the remainder of 2015 and into 2016. In fact, it's already making a point here, as you think about the TDX platform, the debt management platform, in 2016, it will then be dispersed through multiple countries as opposed to one central P&L that you are used to seeing or can see and we can talk about in the UK. Also in International, new product innovation continues to be a very important contributor to International's long-term growth. Their focus is in areas of analytical insights, enhanced decision solutions, new verticals and distribution channels and broadening their data assets. Revenue in International's three largest verticals : financial institutions, telcos, and SMEs, grew 17% in the third quarter versus a healthy 13% in the second quarter of 2015. The decisioning platforms, our analytical services and our debt management revenue grew 19% in the quarter, accelerating from 17% in the second quarter of the year. In 2015, International successfully executed on its strategic initiatives and captured some very important business opportunities that will transform and further broaden its growth profile in the coming years. For the full year, we expect International revenue growth to be above their long-term range that we've talked about of 7% to 10% growth. Workforce Solutions, which has had a stellar performance, I think you'll agree, for the year grew 13% revenue from its continued traction in its compliance solution products, driving market penetration for verification of employment and income, and some very sophisticated analytical insights. Employer interest in our workforce analytics solutions for the Affordable Care Act remains extremely strong. Our subscription-based ACA platform solution, which enables companies to better understand their level of compliance with the requirements of ACA, is one of our most successful NPI initiatives in my 10 years here. We're now expecting to have over 700 clients by the end of this year and we're still getting a large number of inbound requests, which bodes well for EWS and the Employer Services business within EWS for 2016 and beyond. In addition to our core product offering focus on compliance, we're also exploring other opportunities that will enable us to address evolving market needs, including fines and penalties under the Act and any related appeals that follow. We believe this will further enhance our position in the marketplace and make us an even more valuable partner to our big customers. New product innovation continues to make a very meaningful contribution to revenue growth for EWS. We now expect to end the year with a Vitality Index of over 11% versus our target of 10% at the beginning of the year. Earlier this week, EWS was honored for the second year in a row with a Product of the Year Award by the editors of Human Resource magazine. Our I-9 Anywhere product is a cutting-edge service that enables organizations to streamline their Form I-9 immigration form completion process using remote entry for applicants. We're also exceeding our year-to-date targets for both active and historical records in The Work Number database and expect to end the year over our full-year targets. Verification Services growth was in excess of 20% and continues to be driven by adding records to The Work Number database and strong growth in key market verticals, including auto, mortgage, consumer finance, government, and pre-employment. Workforce Solutions has had an outstanding year in 2015 by almost any measure, driving very healthy double-digit revenue growth across multiple product offerings. And for the full year, we expect revenue growth to be in the upper-teens and operating margins to settle in the upper 30%s. Against the backdrop of a changing operating environment, PSOL is consistently delivering growth in the upper end of the multi-year target range of 4% to 6%. We continue to make good progress in key metrics for our direct-to-consumer product offerings. In indirect, we have a broad and diverse set of opportunities in the pipeline, much of which is outside of the banking sector. We expect indirect to make meaningful contributions to revenue growth again in 2016. And we continue to generate good growth in our International segments, as you know, that includes Canada and the UK. Revenue growth for our direct-to-consumer activities in the U.S. was largely driven by higher average revenue per subscriber in the quarter. For the full year, we expect Personal Solutions organic revenue growth to be within their long-term range of 4% to 6%, with healthy operating margins in the upper 20%s. Let me transition back just for a second for a few highlights that we've talked about to you in the past at the corporate level rather than the BU level, and those are NPI and EGI. They continue to make very important contributions to our long-term growth model, provide strong discipline around the allocation of both financial and human capital resources, enabling us to execute with precision. Year-to-date, our new product pipeline is expected to deliver three-year revenue that is 50% greater than the 2014 pipeline. As I mentioned earlier in my comments, that's probably the strongest I've seen since I've been here in 10 years and that bodes well obviously for 2016 and beyond. All of our enterprise growth initiatives leverage our operating and project management disciplines. These disciplines ensure that we develop effective plans for execution and then deliver on the goals we set for ourselves. Our current view for our 2015 portfolio of EGI project suggests that we'll exceed our full-year target by almost 20%. And much like NPI, EGI is becoming a big part of our DNA in every geography and vertical in which we operate. Our insights-driven strategy is a global strategy and it's heavily dependent upon having contemporary IT platforms that can be implemented globally. In the past, you've heard us talk about InterConnect platform. It was first developed in the U.S. and is now used in Canada, the UK and Latin America. We're now in the process of taking a fraud platform exchange that was originally deployed in the UK and successfully deployed in Canada a few years ago and expanding now into U.S. and across Latin America. This solution provides advanced analytics and workflow as well as a known fraud exchange focused primarily on account opening process. The skills and project management expertise in our Global Operations COE is widely regarded and respected internally and by our customers. This organization was heavily involved in standing up the UK government opportunity for TDX, ensuring that we successfully met all of our contractual obligations while positioning us to deliver performance above the portfolio of thresholds for collection effectiveness. More recently, we have conducted a number of customer journeys where we worked directly with customers on the end-to-end process with the objective of improving both the cost effectiveness of our interactions and, as importantly, their overall experience with us. I'm sure you're all interested in an update on our offer to acquire the Veda Group in Australia. I'll share a few thoughts with you there. We believe this opportunity is a nice strategic fit for Equifax. It expands our geographic footprint in a core segment that we know very well. Veda has a strong market position, great products and data assets. They're very profitable and would give us a strong management team in Asia. We believe Equifax's strength in advanced analytics, enterprise growth initiatives, new product innovation and others can act to make Veda even stronger. We're currently early in the process with Veda and, at this point, our agreements with Veda include a purchase price of AUD 2.825. They're non-binding. As you can appreciate, the transaction of this size will take considerable time to negotiate and finalize. We plan to conduct our usual thorough and disciplined due diligence. Simultaneously, we will negotiate the terms and conditions of a purchase agreement. Subject to successful completion of these steps, we would anticipate signing a binding agreement later this year. The final transaction is subject to the approval of the respective Boards of Directors, regulatory approval in Australia, as well as Veda shareholders' approval. If the transaction ultimately goes forward, we'd anticipate completion sometime between late February and early April of 2016. At this point, I'm very confident in our ability to effectively integrate Veda, should we have the opportunity to do so. 2015 is turning out to be the strongest performance in my time with the company. As many of you know, we started the journey of transforming Equifax into a global leader in information solutions back in 2005. I believe we can say we have successfully transformed the culture, thoughtfully invested our capital to support that vision, strengthened our talent base, while continuously honoring our commitments to our shareholders, customers, employees and consumers. I remain optimistic about the opportunities we have for growth in 2016 and beyond. And with that, let me turn it over to John. John? John W. Gamble - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President : Thanks, Rick. And good morning everyone. As before, I will generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis. During the quarter, we recorded income of $12 million from the settlement of certain escrow amounts related to an acquisition outside of the measurement period. We also recorded an expense of $8 million related to the settlement of certain specific legal claims. Consistent with our past practice for treating unusual or infrequent items, we've excluded these items from our adjusted EPS in order to provide investors with a more consistent period-to-period operating comparison. The after-tax effect of these two unusual items was positive $0.05 a share. Now, let me turn to the business units' financial performance for the quarter. U.S. Information Solutions revenue was $312 million, up 12% when compared to the third quarter of 2014, another very strong quarter for USIS. Online Information Solutions revenue was $233 million, up 13% when compared to the year ago period. Mortgage Solutions revenue was $32 million, up 12% compared to Q3 2014. Total mortgage related revenue in USIS was up 20% in the quarter and mortgage related revenue for the total company was up 24%. This compares favorably to the Mortgage Bankers Application Index, which was up 17% in the second quarter. We currently expect total mortgage originations in the fourth quarter to be down year-over-year. For 2016, our current outlook is for mortgage originations to be about flat when compared to the full year of 2015. On to Financial Marketing Services, where revenue was $47 million, up 6% when compared to the year ago quarter. The adjusted operating margin for U.S. Information Solutions was 41.9%, up from 40.3% in the third quarter of 2014. International's revenue was $149 million, flat on a reported basis but up 14% on a local currency basis. By region, Europe's revenue was $64 million, up 5% in U.S. dollars but up 16% in local currency. Latin America's revenue was $52 million, up 5% in U.S. dollars and up 20% in local currency. Canada revenue was $33 million, down 13% in U.S. dollars but up 5% in local currency. For the third quarter, International's operating margin was about 20%, which is flat when compared to the second quarter of 2015. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect International operating margins to remain at about 20% throughout 2015. We expect margins to increase throughout 2016, reflecting continued strong local currency revenue growth including TDX as the UK government contract begins to contribute as well as the benefits of regionalization and other cost actions. Workforce Solutions revenue was $139 million for the quarter, up 13% when compared to the third quarter of 2014. Growth for Workforce Solutions at 13% was very strong and continued to be above our long-term model of 7% to 10%. This reflects continued very strong growth in Verification Services, up 22% year-to-year. The solid growth also reflects the following. Employer Services revenue, principally from unemployment claims, compensation claims, Work Opportunity Tax Credit and other related employer services, declined slightly year-to-year. This reflects the continued very low levels of U.S. unemployment as well as the timing of federal WOTC authorizations in 1Q 2015. Our workforce analytics solution for ACA compliance, which is part of our Employer Services business, continues to perform well ahead of our expectations, as Rick mentioned earlier, and now has 700-plus clients in various stages of boarding, preparing for 2016 ACA reporting. However, as this is a subscription based service in which the boarding services are offered as part of the service, all of the revenue associated with boarding and subscription service fees prior to customer production go live is deferred and amortized over the remaining life of the agreement. As such, despite tremendous growth in customers and activity in the second half of 2015, revenue realization will not begin until very late in 2015, and principally 2016. Long-term, we believe the subscription based model will be greatly beneficial both in terms of customer retention and revenue predictability. It's also additive to our expectations that Workforce Solutions will continue to grow faster than our long-term 7% to 10% model. In the remainder of 2015, it will put pressure on Employer Services growth rates. In 3Q, overall Employer Services activity was more heavily skewed to ACA compliance and that revenue was deferred and, as we indicated, deferred until very late 2015 and predominantly 2016. The Workforce Solutions operating margin was 35.9%, up almost 350 basis points from 3Q 2014. Workforce Solutions continues to make great progress towards achieving margins consistently near 40%. Personal Solutions revenue was $67 million, up 5% on a reported basis and up 6% on a local currency basis. For the third quarter, operating margin was 26.9% consistent with our long-term expectation for operating margins to be in the upper 20%s. The year-over-year decline in operating margin is primarily driven by marketing spend at levels more consistent with our long-term expectations. In the third quarter, general corporate expense at $47 million was slightly over the guidance we gave last quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect general corporate expense to be up slightly from the $47 million in 3Q 2015. The adjusted operating margin at 27.2% was up from 26.4% in 2014 and in line with our expectations for the quarter. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 30.8%. This was benefited by 1.8 percentage points by the very low tax rate on the income from the settlement of the escrow we discussed earlier. Both the income from the settlement of the escrow and the related tax expense was excluded from our adjusted EPS. Excluding this 1.8 percentage point benefit, our 3Q effective tax rate was slightly higher than our effective tax rate of 32.5% in 3Q 2014, and approximately consistent with the guidance we gave for the third quarter. It was also consistent with the historical pattern of our third quarter effective tax rate being below the effective tax rate for the year. Our current expectation for the effective tax rate for the full year is to be slightly less than 34%. Operating cash flow was very strong in the quarter at $247 million. With pending M&A activity, we reduced our level of stock repurchases in the quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $38 million and year-to-date were $94 million. For the full year, we expect capital spending to be approximately $120 million to $125 million. This is above the approximately $100 million we discussed at the beginning of 2015. To support our continued acceleration and enterprise growth and new product innovation initiatives, we've accelerated our investments in global analytics, decisioning, fraud and exchange platforms and supporting network and data center infrastructure as well as internal systems. We are confident these investments will support both revenue growth and margin enhancement. At this level of investment, our capital spending continues to be at a modest 5% of revenue. Earlier, Rick gave you an update on our proposal to acquire the Veda Group. This would be Equifax's largest acquisition in its history. And given the size of the acquisition and the upfront costs associated with the transaction and its integration, we will be excluding all acquisition-specific transaction and due diligence expense as well as integration expenses incurred in the first 12 months following the closure of the acquisition from our adjusted EPS. Now, let me turn it back to Rick. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, John. For the fourth quarter, we expect organic revenue to be between $655 million and $665 million, reflecting constant currency organic revenue growth of 7% to 9%, that's partially offset by 2% of FX headwind. This is consistent with our comments in July that the fourth quarter organic growth would be at the high-end of our long-term range which we've talked about being 6% to 8% growth. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.10 and $1.12, which is up 8% to 10% for the quarter. Excluding $0.02 per share of negative impact from FX, this reflects constant currency organic EPS growth of 10% to 12% for the quarter. Our year-to-date performance results \u2013 our strong year-to-date performance resulted in an increase of our full-year guidance, combined with our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2015 represents an outstanding year for our shareholders, our customers, employees and consumers. And for the full-year, we expect 2015 revenue to be somewhere between $2.652 billion and $2.662 billion, consistent with our guidance in July and up nicely from our guidance of $2.55 billion and $2.6 billion at the beginning of the year and reflects constant currency organic revenue growth of a healthy 12% for 2015. This strong revenue growth is partially offset by 3% negative impact from FX. As before \u2013 and this is only organic revenue growth and we're talking more about next year, we're getting back into the M&A game. As we expect, the operating margins to be somewhere in the range of 27% to 27.5% for the full year, which is up nice 80 basis points over 2014. 2015 adjusted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $4.46 to $4.48 per share, up from the $4.38 to $4.42 per share we guided in July and up significantly from the $4.20 to $4.30 per share guidance we gave at the beginning of the year. That growth reflects \u2013 that reflects a 15% growth in EPS for the year. On a constant currency basis, excluding $0.11 per share of negative impact from FX, at current rates, this reflects a very strong 17% to 18% growth for the year compared to 11% growth in 2014. Now, it's early, but I thought I'd give you some color on how we're thinking about 2016. And as we always do, we'll come back and give you lot more clarity and depth on the February earnings call. As we share today a look at 2016, we fully expect to be towards the upper end of our organic growth target range which is 6% to 8% with additional growth coming from successful completion of our current M&A activities. Our model that we've communicated to you or committed to you is to add over time one point, two points of growth coming from inorganic growth. If you exclude Veda, because of the size of that, our pipeline is strong. We clearly see contributing to our organic growth rate of 6% to 8%, and incremental one point or two points coming from M&A, Veda will be incremental that one point or two points. We also expect operating margins in 2016, when you exclude the impact of acquisitions, to expand nicely given the higher growth expectations we have and this is against the backdrop of an outstanding organic growth rate in 2015. So what \u2013 and we're also expecting the challenge that the mortgage market to be relatively flat in 2016. So in summary, I think you'll agree 2015 is shaping up to be yet another outstanding year for the team. And 2016, where we sit today, we're expecting another outstanding year in 2016. So, operator, with that, we'd like to open up to any questions our audience may have. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go first to David Togut from Evercore ISI. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities : Thank you. Good morning, Rick, John and Jeff. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, David. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities : Rick, if I've heard you correctly, you've made a pretty compelling case for higher growth than you've laid out in your mid-term target. I mean, for example, NPI record pipeline, getting a lot of traction with EGI, Workforce Solutions performing above the plan, great traction internationally porting products from U.S., turned around the PSOL business. And it looks like you're on the verge of what looks to be a very accretive acquisition of Veda, at least by our calculations. So am I hearing you correctly? And, if so, how do you think about sort of the mid to long-term organic growth prospects of the business based on the hand of cards that you're looking at now? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, thank you for, what I think is a complement to the team. I think you captured that effectively, David. The performance you're seeing in 2013, 2014, 2015 and kind of the early looks of 2016 is a result of the last 10 years of effort of laying a foundation of culture of talent and processes like EGI, NPI and others, and we're now the benefactors of that. The performance continues to be very, very broad-based across many verticals, many countries, many products. And I feel very good, very good, as I sit here today looking out to 2016 that the growth for 2016 will also be good, as I mentioned. And we're assuming, David, in that 2016 early look, GDP growths in the economies we participate in to be relatively in line with what we're seeing this year, which is modest in the struggling economies in South America, modest growth in GDP in UK, Canada, in U.S., in the 2%, 2.5% range. So we're not expecting significant GDP or market-based improvement. As you look at longer-term, to the heart of your question, 2017, 2018, yeah, I hope eventually we do see some rebounding, some help from the economies we operate in, which would be further wind at our back. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities : Got it. And then perhaps just expand a little bit, if you would, on PSOL's growth prospects. You've pivoted in the premium channel, you picked up some nice growth there, turned that business around. What you see longer term in the premium channel for Equifax? How can you capitalize on this high-growth channel long term? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I think Trey, now Assad, the interim leader, and as you saw the announcements two weeks ago, Dann Adams will take that business over. I think they've done hell of a job, especially when you compare it to the market as a whole, it's changed at such a rapid pace. I think we'll all agree the free market is here to stay. But we're also of the view, after a lot of work, David, with outside consultants, there always be a place for the paid products that we offer. And we've done a number of interviews through third-party consultants that talk to consumers. And a big cross-section of that consumer base wants to and will buy the pay-for products. Having said that, free is here to stay. It's carved out a nice piece. We're winning, as you know, in the free channel right now through our USIS business, with Trey in his old job. I had a heavy hand working with Rudy on devising a strategy for the Credit Karmas and others in that arena. So simply said, I see the free business is here to stay. I'm convinced the core business can grow in the mid-single digits, with upper 20% margin. I'm convinced our indirect business has got good growth prospects for the next couple years. And lastly, I'm convinced that our International presence will continue to grow stronger. David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities : Understood. Congratulations. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, David. Operator : And we'll go next to Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah, hi. Good morning, gentlemen. Congratulations on the quarter. And obviously, it seems like a lot of your initiatives are working. The first question I had, Rick, was \u2013 and I think I've asked this many times before is you've talked about your NPI and now, I guess, EGI doing a lot better than last year and probably above your expectations. I guess, can you give us some color, how do you keep delivering these impressive results? And does that 10% NPI number you had before need to go up now to maintain this level of excellence? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, thank you, Manav. Truly, we've got a great team. They believe in the culture of growth. They believe in the culture of helping our customers and consumers by building new solutions we couldn't build yesterday. And we've got the great data assets. We've invested in the Foundation, things like (35:15) You've heard me talk about that. Manav, you too talked about people who see it, everyone understands the importance of innovation. Our industry is by itself not a high-growth industry. And our team wants to be a part of a high-growth company and the way for us organically to get there is through innovation. And NPI and EGI are such a vital part of who we are and how we think, it's here to stay. We'll continue to always take a step back and refresh our thinking, re-energize ourselves, modify the approach, expand the approach. We're now 10 years into NPI and probably three years into EGI and those initiatives have got to be refreshed periodically to make sure that they're contemporary and thoughtful and the team is engaged. But as long as I'm going to be here, Manav, we're going to continue to strive for 10%-plus Vitality Index, because it's healthy. Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then just one follow-up on Veda. Clearly, sounds like a good deal. It's a public company. I guess what I was trying to get is, in your diligence, are there a couple of key things that you guys really need to get at, or is this just making sure you're checking the boxes? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, there are obviously. And by no means would I ever go into a diligence process spending any amount of money, let alone $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion, with a mindset that is check the box. We take acquisitions extremely seriously, thoughtfully. And I would prefer not to disclose the exact list of diligence items that we have highlighted. But, trust me, it will be thorough diligence. We're in the data room now. Teams will be in the country in a week. And we have a very thoughtful, exhaustive list of questions that the board and I along with the business unit leaders and COE leaders have thoroughly vetted. So thorough diligence, nowhere close to a perfunctory check the box. Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. Fair enough. Good luck with that. Thanks, guys. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs. Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Good morning. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I first wanted to ask, could you maybe provide a little more insight into how, one, we should be thinking about the magnitude of the contribution from the partnership with Fannie Mae as we do think about our 2016 models for next year? And, two, we've heard a lot of companies looking more at trended data generally. And so maybe you could talk a bit about how you've seen demand for that product evolve and then we should think about it over the medium-term to contribute to growth. Jeffrey L. Dodge - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Okay. (38:05). The Fannie Mae one, I think it's a great one. It's a great one for consumers, it's a great one for the underwriters and it's going to be a great one for our business units of USIS and EWS. As I mentioned, I think, in my comments earlier on, we expect that to ramp up probably in late second quarter, early third quarter. Some work we've got to do, some building we've got to fine-tune to bring that to market for Fannie Mae. And it will be meaningful impact for the business units next year. I am not going to give you exact number, but trust, it will be meaningful for us at BU level. Two, if you think of trended data in general terms, I think, maybe two years ago, we started talking to you about trended data and there was an interest in getting a historical look versus a snapshot look. And the first thing we did is, built the capabilities for batch offline, we call it internally CMS. That ramped up nicely. We then through a technology investment we made in USIS and Rick Smith brought that capability to go online and that's now I think up nicely. I'm also very, very intrigued with the concept on trended data, bringing that \u2013 we're looking at right now, there is a technology requirement as well, we're bringing to EWS the concept of taking one of many different attributes we have in The Work Number database, that attribute being income and showing an underwriter or marketeer, whoever, a historical look, a trended look at their income intellectually excites myself and the team. So as I think of trended data, that will be a next evolution that we'll invest in as bringing trended data towards verification of income. Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And one follow-up. I wanted to make sure I heard something right in the prepared remarks. I thought I heard you say that new product pipeline over the next three years will contribute 50% of 2014 level. I want to make sure I heard that right. And if so, how should we actually interpret that in terms of the revenue and growth in 2017 versus 2014? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I believe the comments I made \u2013 I can check my notes here. Well, the USIS NPI pipeline is running at a rate of 50% greater than the pipeline we had in 2014, so that revenue that we'll earn out in USIS over the next three years is up 50% over the pipeline from 2014. Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you for clarifying. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Thanks. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Paul Ginocchio from Deutsche Bank. Paul L. Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks for taking my question. Rick, the 700 clients you've signed for the ACA compliance platform, I know the revenue hasn't started, but can you \u2013 any way to help us size that for 2016 as you roll in? And then second, your International margins, I know you said they'll be up in 2016. They look as high as 20% \u2013 almost 29% a few years ago. Is there anything different with the International business today that would keep you from getting back to those numbers and how many years do you think it takes to get back there? Thanks. Jeffrey L. Dodge - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Paul. I think I've tried to give some color and text around ACA on past earnings calls. One, the caveat I'll give you is, we've always said it will be very meaningful for EWS, very meaningful, and it exceeds my expectations. So far beyond the expectations we had a year ago, John mentioned, I mentioned, over 700 plus accounts, strong interest level already brewing for 2016. If you follow the ACA dynamics to \u2013 in the level of fines and how those increased over the years and the appeal process, that's going to have a tail that's for many years, as we sit here today and look out. Secondly, and I alluded to it, is getting into this ACA, it can open up other doors and avenues of opportunity we didn't thought about yet, and then the IRS, appeals process, so on and so forth. So I'm not going to give you a number, Paul, but it is meaningful. And very, very \u2013 very important to us long-term, and, again, I think that I mentioned in my comments, probably the most impactful, largest, meaningful NPI we had in my 10 years here. As far as margins on International, yes, I clearly see 2015 is being the trough, if you will, on margins that was intentional. We are integrating a big acquisition for that BU, investing heavily in the UK business unit, the UK government opportunity we talked about. We're also, as John alluded to in our comments, investing heavily in technology, in analytics and platforms around the International operations to fuel growth short-, medium- and long-term. So we clearly expect 2015 to be the trough and margins to start to ramp up nicely in 2016 and beyond. Will they get back to 29%? There's one caveat for that. I think they can over time. I can't tell you what period of time, is the team is working diligently now to regionalize big pockets of costs within International and that requires technology investments to take things from countries to regions and so on and so forth. That will be a big benefactor. If we are fortunate enough to close the acquisition of Veda, we clearly expect that on EBITDA margin basis, that also be a nice lift to the EBITDA margins of International. John W. Gamble - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President : Excluding Veda, right, as Jeff \u2013 I think Jeff was taking you through model for International long-term. In mid-term, what we said is mid-20%s is where we are expecting the margins to end up. Yeah. Paul L. Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Rick, I wanted to ask you about peer-to-peer lenders, this was a subject that came up recently when I hosted a industry research conference call with the outsell. And I just wanted to know when you look at these peer-to-peer lenders, I know they are using Equifax products today, but I wanted to look further out, do you think these peer-to-peer lending systems will lead to an increase of demand of Equifax products or decrease when it comes to peer-to-peer lenders? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Thank you, Andrew. That's a good question. We spend a lot of time thinking about that strategically. And many do refer to that ecosystem as evolving as you have is peer-to-peer. I'd like to think of as more kind of remote lending, unsecured remote lending rather than peer-to-peer because it tend to be a bank involved in many cases, if you're looking at Lending Club or GreenSky or Biz2Credit or others. Point one, I think that that is a marketplace that will exist. I think it \u2013 disrupt the marketplace for the traditional banking sector, the banks now choose to participate themselves. But I think it's here to stay. I think it's got good momentum, good legs. As you mentioned before, they are a user of our data today. They use both the verification of employment and income database many times as well as the core credit file and credit scores. We expect that to continue going forward. So right now I view that as being yet another \u2013 if that sector can allow maybe other people to get access to credit who couldn't get credit in normal system, it's incremental to us. If it's just displacement, the bank would underwrite today, I see it as a non-event for us. The bigger question we're thinking about strategically is how else can we play in that ecosystem. That is truly in five years, 10 years is a big robust part of the market, how do we participate in that market? And that's something we're kicking around right now. Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, guys. Good morning. On the Workforce Solution business, I guess, I wondered if you could give us some color on how much of a drag on margins the ACA compliance offering revenues being deferred, but yet you footing the bill for sales and onboarding customers, et cetera. Is this a big drag and would you expect that investment sort of flattens out at the same time revenue comes and that really helps margins starting Jan 1? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, you don't really see like (46:40) said, one, it is important to put that in context with the profile and the path that Workforce Solutions has been on. It has been remarkable in terms of all dimensions, in my opinion, especially margin. I think John mentioned, the margins are up 350 basis points in the quarter. In spite of what you're talking about, kind of investing in ACA standing up with revenue being a subscription model which is earned out over a period of time. Secondly, and more importantly is, John alluded to in his prepared comments that this business is on a path to 40%-plus margins. And so I think if we put it in context from where it's come from, where it's going, the incremental impact, drag or otherwise of ACA is enough that (47:30). John, do you want to add to that? John W. Gamble - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President : That was \u2013 it's very small, right, because, as you know, you defer expense with revenue, right? So it's just very small negative impact on margin. But again, should be accretive to both revenue and margins in 2016. Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Great. And then just to help us frame your commentary on 2016, I know you have not \u2013 have declined to break out the total revenue impact from \u2013 or your estimate from the mortgage market activity. But is it safe to say that in 2015 year-to-date the core \u2013 as you used to call it, the core revenue ex-mortgage market changes would be growing in excess to the high-end of the 8% organic growth. And I guess if that's right, are there any headwinds we should think about as to why that might flow somewhat next year outside of mortgage? Or should we just think that the initial commentary is early and possibly somewhat conservative? Thanks. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Let me correct that, and John, will jump in. As you think about 2015, I won't to 2016. There's a lot of numbers out there on the NPI Index, growing, I think, Jeff, roughly 17% in 2015. And as it has been in the past for us, you should expect and we are delivering performance that is greater than the index. John Gamble mentioned that the expectations as we sit here today in mid-October looking at 2016, is that market will be relatively flat and that might mean 2 points, 3 points, 4 points, 5 points down, a couple of points up, in that flattish range for 2016. So as we gave an early look at revenue of 6% to 8% organically next year it is with the expectation of the mortgage being in that range and, once again, our team, that being EWS and USIS, performing at levels greater than that by market penetration and new product introduction in the mortgage market. So that's how we think about 2016. John, do you want to add to that? John W. Gamble - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President : No. As Rick indicated right, we just guided fourth quarter as well as next year at the very high-end of our long-term growth rate, so up towards the 8%. And in both of those cases, we've indicated we expect mortgage to be flat or down with the market. So I think that should cover most of the question right there. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks. Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thank you. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Hey, Rick, I just wanted to know if you wanted to comment a little bit more on Veda. That company is doing very well. It actually looks more like a mini Equifax. And you touched on it a little bit in your comments. I wanted to know if you could maybe expand a little bit on this. What is it that you bring to them and what is it that they bring to you beyond the geographic diversification? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Great. Thank you, Shlomo. One note is, Shlomo, we've known each other now for a number of years and you know our philosophy on acquisitions, so this won't surprise maybe the rest of you or you. We have been talking with Veda now, boy, it dates back maybe four years. So it's not like this thing just dropped out of the sky one day and we said this is going to be an interesting acquisition. It's been an organization that we're trying to get to know each other for a quite some time. Two, philosophically, it's important to know that when we think of acquisitions, in Equifax, we are driven by a view of what we can bring to that company that makes that company even better rather than what does that company bring to us that makes Equifax better. I think studies will show, and there's been many studies with many consultants, when you take the path of how they help you as a core business, you oftentimes fail. So having said that, other than the geographical footprint, I think what we can bring there is some of the processes and capabilities that have made Equifax successful the last 10 years in the countries we operate now, things like our Lean process, things like Lean at the customer, things like NPI, things like EGI, Enterprise Growth Initiatives, our Cambrian technology platform, which is fabulous. And as you know, and we have been investing in that for a number of years, bringing that platform to the countries in which Veda operates to link together unstructured internet data, if you will, third-party customer data and our data and build more products than we could build in the past, I think that's a great capability. So it's really deploying some of the things you know so well, Shlomo, that we can play here into their footprint. I do think that over time and one of the things we'll have to determine, it is clearly not baked into any pro forma assumptions that we have now, but over time, if we have a really good business in that part of the world and we've got really good people, which they do, our ability to think about expanding into other geographies now that the two businesses are much bigger business throwing off a lot more EBITDA, make some investments organically and inorganically. I think when you're closer to those geographies, I'm willing to make those bets. Sitting here in Atlanta, Georgia trying to think about making investments in mid-size countries around Southeast Asia as the hub is a risk I'm not willing to take. But if we've got a good footprint in Australia, New Zealand and a few other countries, that's a risk we're willing to take as a company and that would evolve over the next few years. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you for that color. And could you also talk about how much, either qualitatively, quantitatively, how much of the growth in OCIS was due to the fact that you have significant reseller revenue that is helpful to you this year with some of your initiatives over there? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I tried to allude to that in my comments that I had talked about NPI being very diverse with the core credit business there. I've talked about auto being strong, financial services being strong, resellers being strong, mortgage being strong. So that's power forward with 12% growth. And USIS is delivering good strong broad-based growth. There's no doubt, and we've been very open about this, the mortgage market has helped USIS and they've helped themselves, by the way, by outperforming in mortgage, as has the indirect reseller channel for DTC. But their performance, there's no other way to categorize it other than being broad-based. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Then lastly, hey, John, this one is for you. How should I think of the tax rate as I model out the next several years? As you go more international, should I expect the general trend downward? And, if so, how should I think about it? John W. Gamble - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President : Yeah, in general, we would expect that tax \u2013 we've seen a nice trend in the tax rate the last few years down. And we would expect to see the tax rate to probably continue to move positively in the future in terms of positive to us, maybe not at the pace that you've seen over the past several years. But our expectation is you should see some continued improvement over time. We'll talk specifically about 2016, as Rick said, in February. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Shlomo, John, and Lee before him, have kind of helped build a foundation around tax and additional deeper looks at tax over the last X number of years. And that's starting to pay some dividends, paid dividends last year again this year. One last thought I'd say maybe to add to John's comment is go back to if we're fortunate enough to get Veda, the Australian corporate tax rate is a lower tax rate than the U.S. tax rate and many other countries we operate in. It's about 30%, 30% tax rate, so that would benefit lowering the tax rate as well. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you so much. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, everyone. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Bill. William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : So one follow-up question for you on Veda. You mentioned you've been talking with Veda for four years. So my question is why now? Why Australia? Why now? Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I think it's a great question. I think, as we've got to know the company more in-depth over the past few years, we're little more comfortable. Two, I think it's an opportunistic time as well and, Bill, there has been some articles written, maybe you probably read them. By the way, I think Manav had a very good write up, that's worth reading as well. The Australian stock market has obviously taken a beating. Foreign exchange has gone from roughly $1.1, $1-point-something to A$1, to $0.68 to $0.72, $0.73 to A$1. There is the legislation that is passed into law (57:02) from just using negative data to positive data and I think you understand there's been studies all over the world by the IMS and others that talk about how that catalyzes risk-based pricing, risk-based pricing catalyzes growth of lending, that maybe a multi-year look that's going to happen eventually. So maybe last point is we bought TDX roughly two years ago and we delevered from TDX, we've integrated TDX successfully to the balance sheet, our human capital preparedness is in a position to capitalize on a big acquisition. So all of those things kind of came together at the right time. William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Perfect. And then a follow-up for John on Employer Services. Just trying to understand the timeline of the contract in terms of the ACA compliance analytics work, how many months you're looking at typically for implementation during which you're deferring and then typically the length of the contract over which you're going to recognize the revenue? John W. Gamble - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President : Yes. So the implementation can happen over one quarter to two quarters generally speaking. And then you're looking at contracts that are often times a year but can be longer than a year, right? So generally, probably, rarely shorter than a year and rarely probably longer than three years, but predominantly closer to a year. William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Bill. Jeffrey L. Dodge - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : With that, I think we will conclude the call. Appreciate everybody's time and support. Have a good day. Thanks. Operator : This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jeff Dodge. Please go ahead. Jeff Dodge : Thanks and good morning, everyone. Welcome to today\u2019s conference call. I\u2019m Jeff Dodge, Investor Relations. And with me today are Rick Smith, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section of the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we realigned the reporting structure of our direct-to-consumer reseller business, so that it now reports into our Personal Solutions business. Previously, direct-to-consumer resellers were reported within the USIS and International segments, based on the country of the customer. We have provided the quarterly history for Personal Solutions, USIS and International in the new format for each quarter in 2014 and 2015 in the Q&A section of our earnings release. All discussion of the 2015 business unit performance and their outlook for 2016 will be consistent with the new structure. Earlier this week, the Veda shareholders voted to accept Equifax\u2019s acquisition offer, and we also received subsequent approval from court. Therefore, the 2016 guidance provided today as well as the updated long-term business model for Equifax which is included in the Q&A section of our earnings release both include the impact of the Veda acquisition. However, our for the first quarter of 2016 will not include any impact from Veda including the incremental cost of the debt, given the short amount of time Veda will be part of Equifax in the quarter. During this call, as in previous earnings releases, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted operating margin, which will be adjusted for certain items, which affect comparability of the underlying operational performance. In 2016, we will be emphasizing adjusted EBITDA margin in discussing our operational performance. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating income, adding back depreciation, amortization and the impact of certain one-time items, including the acquisition and integration expenses from Veda, which are also reflected in our calculation of adjusted EPS. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables posted on our website. During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in the filings with the SEC, including our 2014 Form 10-K and the subsequent filings. Please refer to our various investor presentations, which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website for further details. Now, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Rick. Rick Smith : Thanks Jeff and good morning everyone. Thanks as always for joining us this morning. Execution across all four of our business units continues to be very strong and enabled us to deliver yet another strong quarter in the fourth quarter as well as full year. For the quarter, fourth quarter 2015, total revenue was $666 million, up 7% on reported basis and up 10% on a local currency basis from 2014. For the quarter, FX created $18 million of year-over-year headwind for us. The adjusted operating margin was 27.1%, up from 26.5% in the fourth quarter 2014. Adjusted EPS was $1.14, up 12% from $1.02 in 2014. And just to refresh your memory that exceeded the upper end of our guidance range we provided on the last call, which is $1.10 to $1.12. Finally, given our strong performance in 2015, our Board of Directors approved a 14% increase in our quarterly dividend, up to now $0.33 a quarter. And this is as you probably all know the sixth consecutive double-digit increase in our dividend rate, reflecting the strong performance of the Company. I think you\u2019ll agree on many dimensions, 2015 was an outstanding year for our 117-year old business. And we exceeded our expectations; we have broad-based contributions from each business unit; investor verticals and across the vast majority of our geographies, our tem delivered. We\u2019re well-positioned for strong 2016. We\u2019ll talk about the economic environment in the Q&A. And I\u2019m proud of the team for their continued commitment to innovation, execution, outstanding customer service. For the full year, total revenue was $2.7 billion, up 9% on a reported basis and up 12% on a local currency basis from 2014 and for the year FX created a $76 million year-over-year headwind. Adjusted operating margin was 27.4%, up 90 basis points from 26.5% in 2014, well above the targeted 25 basis points or so increase we guided to in the past. Adjusted EPS was $4.50, up 16% from $3.89 a year ago and just as a reminder that performance in 2015 was all organically driven, as we had no acquisitions in the year. As I always do, I\u2019ll transition to the business units for some brief commentary before John gives you the details. I\u2019ll go through some highlights for the business as well and then we\u2019ll get into more specifics. So, I want to talk first of all, Jeff mentioned in his opening comments, we repositioned PSOL in 2015. You know that this team has been working diligently on our new growth model, which I fully support and it\u2019s yielding benefits. And John will go through some of those numbers. At the same time, I made the decision -- it was important that we have one tem, one leader, one business that would manage our strategy, our product position in the geographies for our consumer business regardless of that business going direct to the consumer or is going through a reseller. So, we made the decision to realign that under Dann Adams who leads our direct-to-consumer businesses globally. I think that this gives us more continuity going forward. Now, on to the businesses themselves : USIS delivered an impressive 8% revenue growth for the year while expanding its operating margins 290 basis points. Our insights driven strategy, which we talked about, has resonated extremely well for largest clients in our Key Client Program. Our KCP customers are purchasing multiple Decision 360 products and services, in aggregate access almost five Equifax data products, which is remarkable. Across our top 100 clients, Decisions 360 products and services are increasing as well, and there they are accessing about three products on average. So, D360 is really making a difference in the marketplace for us. And USIS, our fraud and identity management solutions business, again delivered healthy 22% growth for the year, largely driven by their ID authentication and management solution products. Our enterprise vertical strategy has made significant contributions to our total Company revenue growth. With experienced industry executives in these verticals, we are better able to leverage our diverse data assets, analytic expertise and IT platforms to deliver premier decision solutions. USIS leads many of our enterprise vertical initiatives. To give you an example of few of those; in 2015, our mortgage vertical grew 25% and USIS at 29% for the total Company. This again compares favorably to the average Mortgage Bankers Application Index, which was up 17% for the year. So, a trend of outperforming the mortgage market has continued now for many, many years. Next example is in the auto vertical, which USIS revenue grew 6% and total Company grew 9%. This also compares very favorably to the overall market where vehicle sales were up approximately 5%. And more recently, our retail banking vertical grew USIS revenue 17% and total Company revenue by 18%. So, you get a sense that with this enterprise focus, taking all of the great assets, getting seasoned leaders in these verticals, delivering those unique assets to our customers is enabling us to grow significantly in many cases, faster than market itself. For years now, we\u2019ve been working with Fannie Mae on ways to better leverage our information to further improve the underlying process for mortgage loans. Late in 2015, Fannie Mae made the decision to incorporate credit data into the underwriting process for mortgage lending. We talked about this with you in the past. This initiative will be an important contributor to revenue in both 2016 and 2017. But it also represents a significant structural change in the loan underwriting, as this sets the stage for applications outside the mortgage lending to increasingly use trended data and our world-class and local talent, and leverage our Cambrian platform, which we talked about before. We are well-positioned to take advantage of those opportunities as they arrive. Live testing is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2016 and go live mid-year. More importantly, trended data will be available to our core credit online delivery system, making the information available for all solutions that access our credit database. Opportunities for USIS in 2016 and beyond are significant. Trended data, ID and fraud, further penetration with targeted vertical markets are all expected to make important contributions to sustained revenue growth. A multiyear model for USIS remains as we\u2019ve communicated to you before with top-line growth in the 5% to 7% range and adjusted EBITDA margin which will now talk about, going forward, is expected to be in a high 40s, expanding to low fifties over time. International delivered 12%, local currency revenue growth with strong performance coming from our operations in Europe and Latin America. Revenue in International\u2019s three largest verticals FIs, telcos, and small and medium sized enterprises, grew 13% in 2015. Our decision platforms, analytics solutions and debt management revenue grew 12% in 2015. Europe had an outstanding year, driven largely by broad-based growth in our UK operations. By industry, FIs; telco; SMEs, all grew high to low double-digits for the year. And our decision solutions, analytical services and debt management all grew at double-digit rates in 2015. TDX has been working, as you know, with UK government to manage their past due consumer debt in -- fourth quarter 2015 and started receiving accounts at that time and started placing those accounts with the collection agencies, analyzing the data in the fourth quarter of last year. And while still early, the performance to-date is slightly ahead of our expectations, this opportunity along with our ongoing sales efforts is expected to be a significant strategic initiative, driving growth for International for years to come. Internal has historically delivered some of our strongest performance in new product innovation, which has been a significant contributor to incremental revenue growth for the market penetration and obviously customer loyalty because we\u2019re building new products and solutions that we couldn\u2019t build in past. This broad-based effort towards innovation continues to fuel growth for International. For the year, six geographies in International represented almost two-thirds of the revenue delivered in NPI Vitality Index of 10% or greater, which is fabulous. International has some exciting opportunities ahead of us, in addition to Veda, which I\u2019ll come back to talk about later, which will become a part of the International operation. In 2016, we\u2019ll broadly expand Cambrian, deploying it across the international geographies, substantially enhancing our ability to deliver analytical insights and drive growth. The continued excellent performance with new products and cost benefits and the regionalization efforts begun last year, as well as the addition to Veda, will expand EBITDA margins in 2016 and beyond. We have moderately raised our expectations for multiyear growth in international now to a range of 7% -- or 8% to 10% with adjusted EBITDA margins in the low-30s going to mid-30s over time. Both those measures of top-line and EBITDA margins reflect the anticipated close of Veda. On the Workforce Solutions, they grew 18%; last year was an outstanding performance as was their 510 basis-point margin expansion for the year. Core product growth along with a number of new product initiatives all contributed to this outstanding performance. Verification Services\u2019 strong and broad-based growth of 25% in the year continues to be driven by adding records of The Work Number database. As our coverage of individual employment records increases, the value of our services enables us to fully penetrate our key target verticals including mortgage, auto, consumer finance, government and pre-employment. And all those verticals, every one of them was up a very strong double-digit for the year, just amazingly strong balance growth. At year-end The Work Number database reached almost 280 million records. And as we stated before, we\u2019re well on our way to achieving 300 million records in total. The recent emergence of what they call, the instant mortgage, facilitated through online application process is generating new growth opportunities for automated income and employment verification. We recently signed one of the largest players in the space, because of our unique ability to deliver both, the credit information as well as the employment and income verification simultaneously, speeding up the process and enhancing the consumer experience. Within EWS, the Employer Services business also had another very strong year in 2015, growing 8%. Much of this growth was driven by our workforce analytics offering which we\u2019ve talked to you about before. This allows employers to ensure that they\u2019re complaint with the Affordable Care Act, as well as providing ACA required tax information to employees. Workforce analytics doubled the business in 2015 and is expected to more than double again in 2016. Our workforce analytics client-base now is approaching over 800 clients and the pipeline remains very strong. To-date, our solution\u2019s largely been focused on our larger enterprise customers; in 2016, we are starting to go down market, enabling us to capture relationships with smaller employees, which we can offer cross-sell opportunities with our other employee services offerings. Healthcare related revenue generated by both our income verification and the Affordable Care Act compliant solutions more than doubled in 2015 versus 2014. Our Workforce Solutions has delivered a stellar performance, not just in 2015 but over the last nine years. As a business, they were quick to adopt our approach to innovate and to embrace LEAN. As a result, they\u2019ve outperformed on revenue growth and substantial improved their margin. Looking forward, expanding and further penetrating the key markets and verticals, increasing the number of records and number of database and globalizing the footprint, will continue to drive revenue growth and margin expansion. Our multiyear expectation for Workforce Solutions has been increased, now expecting revenue growth of 9% to 11% with adjusted EBITDA margin in the high-40% range, expanding to low-50s over time. Personal Solutions finalized its strategic transformation and is executing well against its four-pronged strategy for the year and newly constructed global person solutions with over 19% local currency growth -- revenue growth and is well-positioned for 2016 and beyond. Revenue growth from our direct and indirect consumer activities continues to meet our expectations. Revenue growth in our Personal Solutions business in Canada and UK was up a nice 7% in 2015. In the U.S., we continue to perform consistent with our expectations with increasing ARPU and lowering subscriber churn. Our direct-to-consumer resellers were the most significant contributor to Personal Solutions in 2015. We talked about that when it was a part of USIS. Our reseller revenues in both Canada and UK grew solid as well, solid double-digit in fact in 2015. And the reseller revenue in the U.S. was very strong, primarily driven by the two-year contract with a leading company in the space, Credit Karma, and we\u2019ve talked to you about that; also well-positioned for continued growth in 2016. You may have seen the addition of a new reseller LifeLock, we signed a multiyear contract a few months back. With our broad-based portfolio of data assets, we believe there will be additional opportunities in 2016 and beyond to provide a broader array of credit, income and fraud services to consumers who are direct in reseller channel. Under the new organizational structure, our multiyear expectations for revenue growth in PSOL is now 5% to 8%, up from the previous target of 4% to 6%. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be in the low 30s, expanding to the mid 30s over time. The outsized growth in 2015 was primarily driven by the startup of our relationship Credit Karma, the largest of our DTC, direct-to-consumer resellers. In 2016, we\u2019ll anniversary this revenue. So, long-term growth rates for PSOL revert back to more normal levels again of 5% to 8% with strong growth going forward. Now, on to some corporate highlights before I turn the mic over to John to give you more details on the financials. Today, -- we are truly a globally company with a global set of processes deployed around the world, a global structure, a global culture and a group that\u2019s all focused on a core set of global strategic imperatives. Over the years, we\u2019ve globalized our most critical and fundamental management disciplines, to facilitate greater linkage between our strategy and our execution; and through this effort, we have streamlined our product innovation and placement. We\u2019ve been able to grow the leverage of our IT platforms; we\u2019ve optimized the investment in our talent and we more effectively moved our talent and products where the greatest opportunities exist. This globalization also enables us to better and more quickly leverage the skills and expertise developed in one market i.e. in USIS, into another market, international; again that\u2019s both, processes, products and people. Everybody in the Company is measured and evaluated in what they contribute to our imperatives, regardless of what part of the organization they reside. Having reinvigorated our NPI, new product innovation where we talked to you about last year of our 2.0 kind of next phase of innovation. We\u2019ve launched 64 new products last year. Along with the pipeline of 2016 launches, we expect the revenue contributions to deliver strong NPI growth in 2016 and beyond. Our largest and most diverse growth opportunities are executed under our enterprise growth initiatives, we call it EGI. In 2015, year-over-year revenue growth from these large initiatives was over 20% -- 20% growth over 2014. In 2015, we exceeded our expectations for NPI revenues by 6%. Furthermore, as discussed with you in the past, the class of products we launched in 2015 under our revitalized effort of 2.0, are expected to delivery record level of revenue -- year three revenue when compared to prior year launch. It is the healthiest class of products that we\u2019ve launched since NPI has been in existence here. One of the more exciting new product opportunities revolves around trended data. The effort and investment we are making to fulfill our commitment to Fannie Mae will be leveraged across all of our unique data assets. We firmly believe that the next horizon for information-based solution is trended data, which will underpin more powerful decision solutions for our customers and significantly improve our competitive position. So, to be clear, our focus is trending as many of our unique data assets which are truly unique only to Equifax or customers provide these values, so things like The Work Number, NC+ and others.  Finally, as with many of our corporate management documents, our global NPI process will be implemented in Veda, once we complete the acquisition. And I\u2019ll get to Veda in a moment. In 2015, we launched our big data platform called Cambrian. Cambrian will enable fashion development and delivery of analytic insights like including improving the speed at which we develop new products. It will also greatly enhance our Decision 360 capabilities and provide significant competitive advantage using advanced analytic techniques. Other corporate imperative for us has been around LEAN. LEAN continues to make incremental contributions to our expense leverage and exceeded our goal, contributing over 30% greater benefit in 2015 than we had budgeted. And we leveraged our expertise in LEAN principles to deepen our relationships with some of our largest customers with projects that helped streamline many of their operational activities. And that obviously provides a competitive differentiated solution to the marketplace. Let me close before I give it to John and talk a little bit about Veda. I am sure many of you are aware that the regulatory approval Veda received in December, enabling to schedule the shareholder meeting, which Jeff alluded to a little bit ago. They had the shareholder meeting on February 8th and gained approval there, and they\u2019ve also received the final court approval this week. And at this point, it is our expectation to close the acquisition towards the end of February of this year. We\u2019re very excited about this opportunity. It represents for us the great strategies, strong financial performance, outstanding management team, great market position, and it also gives us a significant opportunity in Asia-Pacific geography to further broaden and enhancing our geographic footprint, which is important to us as we diversify our revenue stream. As we move into our first quarter earnings call and beyond, obviously we\u2019ll keep you apprised of the strategic and the financial progress that the team is making with this new asset. In closing, our performance in 2015 exemplifies the culture and strength of our management team and our dedication, the entire organization to innovate and execute for our customers. It\u2019s a culture and the process that has taken years to develop. And it underpins the confidence we have in our ability to continue to delivering on our commitments and to make our customers and shareholders satisfy with their performance. Our strategic imperatives, as we enter 2016 are in a few areas that that are very important to us; we cascade these around the world, one obviously is deliver strong and consistent profitable growth and shareholder returns; two, to develop unparalleled analytical insights, leveraging the unique data assets that Equifax has; three is innovate from market leadership in the key domains and verticals in which we operate; four, is to serve as a trusted steward and advocate for customers and consumers around the world; and obviously in closing, the last, to invest in talent to drive that strategy and foster the culture of innovation. So with that John, as you always do, pleased take us through the financials. John Gamble : Thanks Rick and good morning. As before, I will generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis. Now, let me turn to the business units\u2019 financial performance for the fourth quarter. As Jeff mentioned at the opening, all BU information is based on the new segments with direct-to-consumer resellers moved to PSOL from USIS and International. Going forward, given the substantial amortization expense related to the Veda acquisition, we will increase our discussion of EBITDA for Equifax and the operating segments. U.S. Information Solutions revenue in 4Q \u201815 was $296 million, up 7% when compared to the fourth quarter of \u201814. For the full year, revenue of $1.2 billion was up 8%. This compares favorably to our long-term expectation for USIS of 5% to 7% growth as both mortgage and automotive were very strong in 2015. Online Information Solutions revenue was $204 million in 4Q \u201815, up 6% year-to-year and $842 million for the full year, up 8% when compared to the prior year. Mortgage Solutions revenue was $28 million in 4Q \u201815, up 10% year-to-year and $124 million for calendar year \u201815, up 17%. Total mortgage related revenue was up 16% and 17% in the quarter for USIS and Equifax, respectively. For calendar year \u201815, mortgage-related revenue was up 25% and 29% for USIS and Equifax, respectively. This compares favorably to the average Mortgage Bankers Application Index, which was up 14% in the fourth quarter and 17% for the calendar year. Financial Marketing Services revenue was $64 million in 4Q \u201815, up 7% year-to-year and up $205 million for calendar year \u201815, up 5% year-to-year. The operating margin for U.S. Information Solutions was 41.6% in 4Q \u201815 and 41.9% for calendar year \u201815, up 50 basis points and 290 basis points, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 48.5% in 4Q \u201815 and 49.7% in calendar year \u201815. We expect to see continued expansion in USIS EBITDA margins in 2016. International\u2019s revenue was $143 million in 4Q \u201815, down 1% on a reported basis, but up 11% on a local currency basis. Revenue was $569 million for calendar year \u201815, down 1% on reported basis, but up 12% on a local currency basis. By region, Europe\u2019s revenue was $64 million in 4Q \u201815, up 3% in U.S. dollars and up 10% in local currency. For calendar year \u201815, Europe revenue was $247 million, up 2% in U.S. dollars and up 12% in local currency. Latin America\u2019s revenue was $49 million in 4Q \u201815, up 2% in U.S. dollars and 18% in local currency. Revenue was $200 million for calendar year \u201815, up 4% in U.S. dollars and 17% in local currency. Latin America showed outstanding local currency growth throughout \u201815, led by strong growth across Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay. Canada revenue was $29 million, down 11% in U.S. dollars but up 5% in local currency. Revenue for calendar year \u201815 was $122 million in U.S. dollars, down 11% in U.S. dollars but up 3% in local currency. Canada\u2019s performance strengthened very nicely in the second half and has momentum going into 2016. International\u2019s operating margin was 20.7% in 4Q \u201815 and 20% in calendar year \u201815. EBITDA margins were 27.2% in 4Q \u201815 and 27% in calendar year \u201815. Both operating and EBITDA margins were down year-to-year in International. However, both showed sequential improvement in the fourth quarter relative to third. In 2016, we expect to see continued margin improvement driven by continued strong local currency growth and the benefits of regionalization as well as from the addition of Veda. We\u2019ll see some margin pressure related to weakened foreign currencies, particularly with the Canadian dollar and the devaluation of the Argentine peso. Workforce Solutions revenue was $144 million in the quarter, up 12% year-to-year and $578 million in calendar year \u201815, up 18% year-to-year. This reflects continued very strong growth in verification services, up 14% in fourth quarter and 25% year-to-year. Employer Services also delivered a very strong performance, up 8% in the fourth quarter and 8% in the calendar year. This was driven by success in their Compliance Center and offerings and their solution for employer\u2019s compliance with the requirements of the ACA. The Workforce Solutions\u2019 operating margin was 36.8% in 4Q, \u201815 and 37.9% in calendar \u201815, up 430 and 510 basis points respectively. Workforce Solutions EBITDA margins were 44.3% in the fourth quarter and 45.1% in the calendar year. We expect continued strong expansion in Workforce Solutions\u2019 EBITDA margins in 2016. Global Personal Solutions revenue was $84 million in 4Q \u201815, up 12% on a reported basis and up 14% on local currency basis. Revenue in Calendar year \u201815 was $346 million, up 18% on reported basis and up 19% on a local currency basis. PSOL\u2019s business has two main areas, credit and identity monitoring services sold through direct and indirect channels that protect and monitor consumer\u2019s ID and enable consumers to gain better access to credit, and credit another data sales sold through our DTC reseller partners. Credit and identity monitoring services sold through the indirect channel represent those circumstances where Equifax provides white label, online credit and identity service through partners. In 2015, ongoing revenue from credit and identity monitoring services grew at the high end of the 4% to 6% guidance range we have previously provided for the PSOL segment, prior to the addition of DTC resellers. DTC resellers\u2019 revenue represents sales of credit and other data to resellers. In these cases, Equifax provides data and analytics but not the web properties with which the customer directly interacts. Examples of this business are our relationships with Credit Karma and LifeLock. DTC reseller revenue showed substantial growth in 2015, driven primarily by our relationship with Credit Karma, which began in 4Q \u201814. Our DTC reseller revenue should continue to grow faster than our direct-to-consumer sales but as Rick mentioned, not at the very high rate we saw in 2015. Looking forward, as previously mentioned, we expect this overall segment to grow 5% to 8%. Operating margin was 27% in 4Q \u201815 and 27.5% for calendar year \u201815, consistent with our expectations. EBITDA margins were 29.7% in 4Q \u201815 and 30.2% in calendar year \u201815. PSOL revenue and operating margin in 4Q \u201814, were very strong, reflecting a large rich deal won in 4Q \u201814. 4Q \u201815 operating margin of 27% was consistent with our expectations and our guidance, and reflects the impact of our decision to invest more in marketing in 2015 as well as the addition of DTC reseller business to PSOL. In the fourth quarter, general corporate expense was $51 million excluding $3.7 million of onetime expenses associated with the Veda acquisition. General corporate expense was up slightly from 3Q consistent with our guidance. For the first quarter of 2016, we expect general corporate expense excluding Veda related acquisition and integration expenses to be in the range of $55 million to $60 million and run at a slightly lower rate throughout the remaining quarters of the year. The adjusted operating margin at 27.1% in 4Q \u201815 and 27.4% in calendar year \u201815 were up 60 and 90 basis points year-to-year respectively. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 34.4% in 4Q \u201815 and 34.8% in calendar year \u201815. We expect to see improvements in our adjusted EBITDA margin in 2016 expanding by about 75 basis points. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 32.6%, equal to our expectation and in our guidance. For the full year, our non-GAAP effective tax rate after adjusting for non-GAAP items, the Missouri State tax law change in the second quarter and the TDX escrow adjustment in the third quarter was 33.7%, consistent with our comments during our third quarter release. Looking forward into 2016, our expectation is for a GAAP effective tax rate of about 33%. Operating cash flow was $205 million in 4Q \u201815 and $742 million in calendar year \u201815, both were very strong reflecting strong earnings and working capital performance. Free cash flow equal to operating cash flow less capital expenditures was very strong in 2015 at $596 million, up 12% from 2014. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $53 million and for calendar year \u201815 were $146 million. Consistent with our comments throughout the year, the increase in capital spending versus 2014 reflects the acceleration of our investment in new product innovation, deployment of global platforms including Cambrian and other analytics, InterConnect, fraud and our new PSOL infrastructure. As we look forward to 2016, we expect capital spending including Veda to be in the range of 5% to 6% of revenue. This is consistent with 2015 and reflects a continuation of our current investments as well as some additional spending in the near-term as we integrate Veda. This is slightly higher than our expected long-term rate of capital spending of about 5% of revenue due to the Veda integration. As Rick indicted, we have received Veda shareholder approval and approval from the Australian court to complete the purchase of data. We expect the acquisition to close on about February 25th. Total purchase price including assumed debt and fees is approximately U.S. $1.9 billion. At the close of the Veda transaction, we will have debt outstanding of just under $3.1 billion and debt-to-EBITDA on the trailing basis of just under three times. As indicated previously, we expect to maintain our current credit ratings. In 2016, we will focus on using our very strong cash flow for debt reduction and returning our leverage to a level consistent with our current credit ratings. Therefore, we do not intend to repurchase shares in 2016. We will however continue with acquisitions beyond Veda in 2016 with the goal of delivering on our long-term model of an additional one to two points of revenue growth. Assuming acquisitions consistent with our targets in 2016 and 2017, we would expect to repurchase shares in 2017. As we discussed last quarter, we will exclude Veda transaction and other acquisition expenses and integration expenses incurred in the first year after the Veda acquisition through 1Q \u201817 in calculating adjusted EPS and adjusted operating margin and EBITDA margin. We will provide information regarding transaction and acquisition expenses incurred with the acquisition as well as integration expenses we expect to incur related to the Veda acquisition after the transaction closes at our 1Q \u201816 earnings release conference call. Also, Jeff mentioned at the beginning of the call, given the relatively short time we will own Veda in the quarter, our 1Q \u201816 guidance does not include the impact of Veda, nor the incremental debt costs, including interest expense related to the acquisition. We will provide you details on the impact of Veda on 1Q \u201816 during our 1Q \u201816 earnings call in April. The 2016 full year guidance Rick will provide includes Veda. For 2016, we have assumed Veda will be a part of Equifax for 10 months. Veda revenue for the 10 months is assumed to be U.S. $220 million to $230 million. This includes an estimate of the impact to revenue of U.S. GAAP, which will be updated as we close 1Q \u201816. The benefit to adjusted EPS from Veda, net of acquisition financing cost is about $0.10 to $0.15 per share. As a reminder, adjusted EPS excludes acquisition amortization expense. For modeling purposes, you can assume an average cost of our Veda acquisition debt during 2016 of about 2.5%. Veda\u2019s seasonality of revenue is similar to Equifax with 2Q revenue typically the highest from the seasonality perspective; 1Q generally the lowest revenue; and 3Q and 4Q somewhat similar in terms of revenue. The spread between 2Q and 1Q revenue has recently been in the range of 7% to 10%. Now, let me turn it back to Rick. Rick Smith : Thanks John. Some summary comments before we go to the Q&A. As I have mentioned before to all of you and as many of you had noted in our conversations in the write-ups, the level of execution and the momentum that this team has generated in 2015 is the best in my 10 years here. So, I think it is truly remarkable what they have done. We are well-positioned for growth opportunities that lie ahead and our ability to take on any of the challenges that may confront us. In coming years, the revenue going to be contributed from the class of new products that we just launched and expected to exceed our historical leverage that there is wind at our back. Our enterprise growth initiatives including expanding insights driven Cambrian, healthcare, trended data, and auto will not only enhance our competitive position but also deliver growth opportunities for years to come. All of these efforts are expected in our opinion to offset the rate anticipated slowdown of U.S. mortgage market, which as you know started to decelerate over the course of 2015. While it\u2019s impossible to predict where the mortgage market is going go, especially when I looked this morning, the ten-year treasury is under 1.6. Forecast range from down 20% to up mid single-digits. Our forecast that we\u2019ve given you for 2016 is anticipating that the mortgage market will be down single-digits in 2016. And obviously, our expectation is that team in both Workforce Solutions and USIS, as they have done for many, many years, outperforms that quite significantly. Obviously if rates continue to stay low as they are, there may be some market upside to what occurs in the mortgage market, and we\u2019ll know obviously as we head deeper into the year. 2016 is yet again expected to be another strong year of performance for the Company. For the year, we expect revenue including the impact of Veda to be between $3 billion and $3.1 billion, reflecting constant currency revenue growth of 15% to 19% that\u2019s going to be partially offset by about 2 to 3 points of FX headwind. This is consistent with our comments in October that the organic constant currency growth would be at the high end of our long-term range of 6% to 8%. I\u2019ve got to say it again that\u2019s the high end of the range coming off of constant currency growth last year of 12%. So, it\u2019s I think quite remarkable. As John mentioned, we also expect to add another 1 to 2-point of tuck-in acquisitions throughout the year. These additional acquisitions are obviously beyond Veda, which as he said is not including in the first quarter of 2016 outlook. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $4.95 and $5.05 which is up 10% to 12% for the year. Excluding approximately $0.13 per share of negative impact from FX, this reflects constant currency organic EPS growth of 14% to 15%. For the first quarter, we expect organic revenue to be between $685 million and $695 million, reflecting constant currency organic revenue growth of 8% to 10% to be partially offset by about 3 points of FX headwind in the quarter. First quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.14 and $1.16, which is up 7% to 8%. Excluding $0.04 per share of negative impact from FX, this reflects constant currency organic EPS growth of 10% to 12% for the first quarter. Again, we expect to close Veda in the first quarter, but we\u2019re not including it in the estimate. Maybe during Q&A we\u2019ll talk about why it\u2019s going to push forward [ph] for that one month. In 2016, we are also going to shift our focus to adjusted EBITDA margin that we talk about that throughout the call since it better represents the true operating performing of the Company. 2016, we expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to expand by solid 75 basis points over last year\u2019s 34.8% EBITDA margin. In our modified multiyear business model, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins to be in the upper 30% to 40% range with annual acceleration of at least 25 basis points. So, with that operator, if you\u2019d open it up for questions for audience, it\u2019d be great. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from David Togut with Evercore ISI. David Togut : Thank you. Good morning, Rick and John; and congrats on the strong results. Rick, could you give us your outlook for the health of the consumer by major geographies served? Given some of the trends we\u2019re seeing globally, do you think the consumer will hold up? Rick Smith : Dave, that\u2019s a great question obviously with the volatility we\u2019ve seen in the first five or six weeks of 2016. John and I spend a lot of time with our teams talking about that. I can\u2019t at this juncture draw a connection between equity market volatility and the health of the consumer in our major markets around the world. As you know, we operate in about 19 different countries and have a great pulse on what\u2019s going on with customer, many cases on a daily basis across different verticals, different industry sectors and combined that with some very smart people internally and externally we leverage on a routine basis, economists that help us think through consumer small business lending trends. And we are not see a slowdown in our markets, maybe exception here or there but nothing material David that gives me concern that the forecast we just gave you for guidance is not very attainable. We\u2019re just not seen that strong correlation. So, at this juncture in our major markets around the world, the consumers continue to be healthy. We described it, I think it was a few quarters ago is in a sweet spot, we still believe that and feel it and we see it in our numbers. David Togut : Great, thank you. And then could you talk about operating leverage for 2016? Most of your margin comments were more mid to long-term which were very helpful. But, we saw Workforce Solutions\u2019 margin up in the fourth quarter, for example 430 basis points. So, how should we think about sort of margin profile by business segment for this year? Rick Smith : Let me give you the aggregate, and I\u2019ll ask John to go to the details. But, I did guide at the very end about 75 basis -- we\u2019re talking EBITDA now David. 75 basis points of margin expansion at the corporate level 2016 over 2015, what you can see there is continued margin expansion in businesses that have been expanding now for quite some time that EWS as you alluded and USIS that trend will continue. Number two, we intentionally made investments in PSOL in 2015, positioning them for better growth in 2016 and beyond. That\u2019s kind of the highest now. So, you\u2019ll start to see margin expansion in PSOL from levels you saw in 2015. We also invested in two main areas in International that are behind us now, one was as you\u2019re very aware of, standing up of the UK government contract, which was a yearlong having investments and now the revenue starts to come, because it was virtually no revenue in 2015. Secondly, we talked about kind of regionalization of platforms and people and processes to give us a long-term more cost efficient international model. Those investments were largely made in 2015; those have now been anniversaried. So, you\u2019ll start to see International and PSOL margins expanding this year and obviously International I alluded to, will be -- also their margins will be enhanced with the addition of a very high margin successful business in Veda. Beyond that, do you have any other\u2026 John Gamble : Yes. The only thing I\u2019d add is compliance and security expenses continued to tremendous growth in 2014, 2015, still more substantial investment in \u201816, but we do expect over time those are going to moderate in terms of the increases, although still be substantial. So, we should see some accretion over time related to the moderation of those curves. Rick Smith : I\u2019ll make a statement here, John, correct me if I am wrong, David, to give you a little more texture, maybe to what you\u2019re looking for. If you look at each individual BU and you look sequentially, \u201816 versus \u201815 every BU\u2019s EBITDA margin will go up from 2015 and 2016\u2019s expectation. John Gamble : You\u2019ll see much larger expansion in the USIS and EWS, as you\u2019ve seen over the past several years; should see some across PSOL and International; and then overall, we will expand, because you\u2019re just not going to see the degradation from the last two. David Togut : That\u2019s very helpful, thanks. Just a quick final question. Rick, you called out 280 million Work Number records, which is up pretty substantially. Can you give us a sense of how you\u2019re thinking of the growth of this business, particularly as The Work Number records increase, are seeing a much greater hit rate on searches by clients? Rick Smith : David, I think this business -- all four businesses are executing high and have great growth opportunities. These guys are in early stages of the growth opportunities. It\u2019s not only going to 280 to 300 increase, hit rate, as you mentioned; it\u2019s also -- we are so early and I gave you some sense of the growth rates by verticals. And it\u2019s amazing; these are very, very high double-digit growth rates in the verification side. We\u2019re such -- we are so rightly penetrated in many of the high growth markets; there are years of growth to go on the verification side in the U.S. alone. Let me add to that which is not the heart of your question, growth from the analytics platform that we\u2019ve built on the employer side. And I gave a little comment, which I didn\u2019t expand upon but I will now, in my prepared comments David. The appetite for customers in geographies around the world for us to take this platform of The Work Number to their geographies is stronger now than it\u2019s ever been. And we have got a team working full speed, couple of main geographies around the world, so I\u2019m not going to get involved in detail on where but to solve the same problems that we are solving here, there. So, long way of saying the growth opportunity is significant, it\u2019s multiyear and it\u2019s not just the U.S. Operator : And we will take our next question from Paul Ginocchio with Deutsche Bank. Paul Ginocchio : Hey Rick, just couple of questions on the trended data. I was just wondering first, if you want to -- probably too sensitive but if you want to talk about maybe the price premium or the ASP for trended data versus credit snapshot. Also wanted to know what percentage of mortgages currently use or kind of pull The Work Number and where you think that\u2019s going to be at sort of -- what is this currently; what could be it at year-end and maybe what you think could be out two to three years from now? Thank you. Rick Smith : Thanks Paul. Yes, your comments were right; I am not going to the level of pricing increase we get from trended data. But the way to look at it is the value derived on an ROI basis from the mortgage underwriters from looking at data over multiple years versus a short time, is significant, as a result of willing to pay more for trended data. The other point I alluded to in my prepared comments, Paul, was we are going trend more than just the credit file and take our really unique data assets that no one else has and start trending those. Think about the value of trending income data versus taking a snapshot in time, and then you take the utility data. So, the trending -- I really mean this is sort of the trending of data especially the unique data assets we have I think creates innovative products and solutions for the years to come. As far as the mortgage market on Workforce Solutions, again, we don\u2019t disclose that level of detail. I\u2019ll leave it at this though there is still significant room. And David Togut kind of alluded this. At the database grows, the hit rate goes up; it benefits all verticals including mortgage but we still have penetration opportunities, not just on hit rate but by account in the mortgage arena in EWS, much like we do in auto, insurance, credit card, government, and others for The Work Number. Paul Ginocchio : If I could just ask a follow-up, I think you left guidance for USIS relatively stable under the new system versus the old. I am just wondering with the opportunity the trended presents to you, why would you have kind of not set up a little bit? Rick Smith : There is a couple of things, one is short term, as we look at \u201816 and then I\u2019ll go to multiyear, two. For \u201816, there is one primary thing going on there. You\u2019ve got significant headwinds, specifically in the first half of the year in USIS for mortgage. Mortgage\u2019s biggest quarters were the first and second quarter and as we said before, it starts to decelerate in second half. So, that\u2019s why I left that model consistent for \u201816 Paul. In fact I think, it would be at the lower end of that range in \u201816, to be very clear with you. And then as far as the multiyear model, I\u2019d not ratchet [ph] that up; I\u2019d rather do that once I have success under our belt and we see just how big this is going to be. So, I think it\u2019s a little premature business. But at the right time, once we see the success and traction, as you know there is lives in mid-year and will be a lot smarter at the end of the year and if model justifies being changed at that time, we will. Paul Ginocchio : Great. Thanks Rick and congratulations on the Social Security Administration contract. If I could just really quickly ask for the my online social security accounts, how many times a year do you think they\u2019ll verify each of those 22 million accounts on average? Thanks. Rick Smith : Great question, I have no idea. Paul Ginocchio : Okay. Rick Smith : Good question, Paul. Paul Ginocchio : Thanks. Rick Smith : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Manav Patnaik : Yes, good morning gentlemen. Rick, nice to hear, as always, a lot of progress, but it sounds like at least with all of your initiatives, you guys have taken that up one notch like level there. And I think you still have your NPI target of 10%; I know I have asked this many times before. It doesn\u2019t sound like you need to motivate people by taking it up, but at what point do you do sort of push yourselves even further to the target up? Rick Smith : I think of it this way, I did mention that the revitalization in NPI that we launched in late \u201814 benefited in the \u201815 class, one of the strongest classes ever and that bode will well for next three years. So, it\u2019s moving in the right direction. Two, you always have, as you think about the vitality index, Manav, you get big chunks of product roll off every once in a while. So, making up big chunks of products is harder than it sounds, just to stay at 10%. But three, maybe most importantly, you\u2019ve heard us now talk for about two years around EGI. It\u2019s not about innovation it is taking large complicated growth initiatives across multiple geographies and making sure we sustain the kind of growth we need there. And that was I think 20% growth I alluded to in my earnings call. So look at it totally, and the contributions from NPI and EGI, it is significant. So I don\u2019t feel compelled at this juncture to ratchet up 10%, beyond 10%. Manav Patnaik : Okay. And then, in terms of the margins, the 25 basis points still, I mean -- I guess this clearly sounds like an element of conservatism to that. Like what are the puts and takes that go through your planning when you still stick with 25 as opposed to maybe 50? Rick Smith : I think you know us well enough by now; we tend to be thoughtful and maybe little conservative in our guidance. We guided 25 basis points for 2015, what was the -- operating margin was up 90 basis points and guiding 2016 with EBITDA margin up 75 basis points. So, I don\u2019t want to starve the business and you heard John talk about investment and CapEx, while was higher than we have historically, the standardized platforms to bring Cambrian, global to facilitate faster more profitable growth. So, Manav, I think it\u2019s Rubik\u2019s Cube and I think that combination of really strong organic growth that we\u2019ve talked to you about combined with margin expansion of 25 basis points. If we can get this business to do that year in and year out and get to our aspiration of goals, we alluded to 40% EBITDA margin, I think that\u2019s pretty damn good. I hope you agree. Manav Patnaik : That\u2019s fair. And then just one last one from me, I mean I know you said it and your guidance obviously implies as well where you don\u2019t expect a consumer recession. But just trying to understand, like if equity markets operators drag and we do get there, like obviously Equifax today is much different than what it was in 2008, 2009. So, any high level comments on which areas should hold up and which areas would be a hit? Rick Smith : We\u2019re not anticipating a global recession at this juncture. If it does occur, I look today versus how we were positioned as a company in 2007 has been dramatically different, LEAN as an example. And our ability to operate global platforms and take global processes and improve them, take cost out, and act and react to recessionary environment is far greater today than it was. We were in our infancy stage of understanding, globalizing the platform, globalizing the process and deploying LEAN around the world, so we could rack much fast if we had to in that environment. Two, just the overall pipeline of products, we have much stronger now. We are in early days of NPI; back then EGI did not exist; and so, just the ability to grind out organic growth didn\u2019t exist then. And lastly, we have built some counter -- two other points, countercyclical products that are bigger now; we do well -- think unemployment [ph] as an example, EWS that we do well in a recessionary environment. And we\u2019re more global today, especially with the addition of Veda and their platform. If the entire globe hits a recession, that doesn\u2019t really help you. But if it\u2019s isolated to a few of the developed markets, the fact that we\u2019re bigger global enterprise may help us as well. Operator : We will take our next question from Andrew Steinerman with JP Morgan. Andrew Steinerman : Hi Rick. I would like to ask you about the Veda revenue and EPS assumptions that you highlighted for the 10 months included in Equifax. On kind of a like-for-like basis, what type of revenue growth does that assume and when you talk about the EPS accretion, are you counting on core synergies? Rick Smith : Yes. I\u2019ll take a crack at it, and John, you can jump in. Think about Veda as a business that kind of fits right into our organic growth model, which is 6% to 8% and maybe the upper end of that, upper part of that range versus the lower part of that range. So, nicely in our organic growth target, not just for \u201816 but year in and year out, and much like the rest of the world and there is opportunity for tuck-in acquisitions in the geographies that are exciting to us in these early days. On the -- what was the second question? Andrew Steinerman : Core synergies. John Gamble : It does not include synergies. So, we didn\u2019t assume any meaningful synergies in 2016. Rick Smith : Yes. I said on cost side. Yes, there really aren\u2019t many cost synergies. In fact it\u2019d be just the opposite. We\u2019re adding to cost Veda to brings things like Cambrian and InterConnect and other things to help link data, and grow faster. John Gamble : Andrew, if you look at the last reported revenue of Veda, and then take a look at what we have just indicated, growth rate for 18 months for that to be in the high single, it\u2019s near 10%. Andrew Steinerman : Okay. And just more on that. Rick, are you counting a lot on comprehensive data being a meaningful impact to the Australian market over the next couple of years when thinking about the Veda acquisition? Rick Smith : The model did not contemplate that Andrew. I\u2019d tell you what I walked away on my last visit with the team down there more impressed with the way in which contributors have been contributing data, positive I should say. So, it\u2019s not right now in our guidance, it\u2019s not in the model we use to justifying buying the company. But I\u2019m more hopeful and impressed now than I was in early days that it will be a meaningful change down the road. Operator : We will take our next question from Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. Gary Bisbee : Hi, good morning. You already commented on USIS maybe being towards the lower end of the long-term targets but how about the other businesses; are any of them in position to be above the high end this year or do we think those targets by segment are good places to be for 2016? Rick Smith : Look, the ranges are there for a reason; we think they\u2019re pretty solid ranges. And you\u2019re going to see nuances and noise quarter-to-quarter, as you guys know and maybe even year-to-year but over multiple years, those ranges are still pretty good. The one -- again, one business that\u2019s really clicking on all cylinders and probably has more runway to exceed would be EWS. Their sandbox is just -- it\u2019s a bigger sandbox and there less mature business and they\u2019ve got early days of growth. If there is one that you\u2019ve got to say maybe has more opportunity to outperform, it\u2019s that one. Gary Bisbee : And would that include your commentary about mortgage being much tougher comps still able to be where you are? Rick Smith : Absolutely. And the other thing I\u2019d say maybe too is -- so, yes, that\u2019s including the mortgage environment I just alluded to down single-digits and we\u2019ll have to outperform it. Obviously if mortgage is stronger and we expect that benefits EWS as well as USIS. But then the other business maybe short term in 2016 I think about having maybe more runway then that long-term model would be PSOL because they\u2019ve got some pretty good things going on as they redefine their model as well. Gary Bisbee : And then question on within International on Latin America, a two-part question I guess. It seems like there is a lot weaker economic activity in a bunch of those markets, and you face a really tough comp. So, how are you thinking about that? And then specifically, can you comment on how much inflation in Argentina is driving the growth of that segment versus volume or unit sales of your offerings? Thank you. Rick Smith : Yes, I don\u2019t think we break that. That\u2019s second part. But the first part is and I think I alluded to in my comments, what\u2019s allowing International to continue to grow at the rates growing in spite of difficulty economic environments in Latin America and other parts of the world too, is innovation. I mentioned that the majority of their -- two-thirds of their revenue in these large geographies are generating vitality indexes from new product innovation above 10%. So, if it weren\u2019t for that and they are also benefactor of EGI obviously as well. But if it weren\u2019t for those innovative approaches, to products and EGI, they would not be performing like they\u2019re performing. Gary Bisbee : Great. And then, just one last clean up one. Do you have -- I know it\u2019s early but do you have a sense for what we might expect the amortization and depreciation from Veda to be? Thank you. John Gamble : It\u2019s early. And obviously as the transaction closes, these numbers will be updated. But acquisition amortization right now, we\u2019re assuming it somewhere in the neighborhood of $95 million. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Nick Nikitas : Thanks. This is Nick Nikitas on for Jeff. Just switching back to Veda and maybe talking more about some revenue, potential synergies; you mentioned TDX has seen some positive signs in Australia. Do you guys really see that as an opportunity to leverage Veda\u2019s presence throughout the region or if any potential avenues you see to drive additional growth into the future? Rick Smith : Yes. We\u2019ve got a small team down the south in Australia and New Zealand that represents the debt management analytics platforms. So yes, having access to a much larger sales organization with people, longer standing relationships will help our debt management growth. But beyond that, one, we\u2019re getting a business that\u2019s got great organic growth opportunities; alluded the fact there is inorganic opportunities. And then the others are bringing things like The Work Number to Australia, bringing Cambrian to Australia, bringing InterConnect to Australia, bringing our global fraud platform to Australia. It\u2019s hard, you can\u2019t underestimate the relationship these guys have in Australia and New Zealand and the market presence they have with all major verticals is significant. And they build out, much like Equifax has in Australia and New Zealand, a very wide array of unique data assets. And if we can bring our knowhow to bear there, to build products, that is a great growth driver. And then, as someone -- I think that Andrew asked a second ago, eventually when comprehensive as he referred to or positive data as many referred to it, when that becomes mainstream, guess what, we know how to manage positive data and build platform on positive data really well. And that in years to come there is another growth driver for us. Nick Nikitas : And just within the UK, was TDX a sizable contribution to 4Q or is that still thinking about \u201816 more of a strong contributor there and if we are looking at growth rates similar low double-digit European growth rate is possible? John Gamble : Yes. We saw very nice growth rates in the core UK business. TDX continued to provide growth. But we saw very nice growth rates in the core UK business as well. And just to make sure everyone understands my answer. The $95 million for Veda acquisition amortization is an annualized number; it\u2019s not the \u201816 number, it\u2019s an annualized number. Operator : We will take our next question from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Andrew Jeffrey : Hi. Thanks, good morning. Rick, it\u2019s interesting the way the way the PSOL business has evolved generally and direct-to-consumer in particular and obviously Credit Karma was a big win. Can you frame up perhaps the additional opportunities in DTC; is Credit Karma probably the biggest single opportunity you see out there recognizing that the market\u2019s changing pretty quickly and you have some new entrants or are there other large potential targets too that could be callouts, the way Credit Karma was? Rick Smith : No doubt that Credit Karma in the U.S. marketplace for the reseller side or the indirect channels we call is uniquely large piece of business. So, might there be a larger U.S. piece of that? Might be; I don\u2019t see it as probable. The LifeLock is going to be a very good add to us expanding was PSOL does. And also think about -- well you\u2019ve got -- there is two other things that are important. You\u2019ve got now taking that same concept of Credit Karma to other geographies, which we operate, taking it to Australia, taking to Canada, taking to UK. And also you\u2019ve got Dann Adams. Now, one of beauties Andrew of moving leaders around the different businesses is they have a different perspective than the predecessor. And Dann is looking at this business now saying kind of look at the breach market differently. He is looking at saying how do I combine some of the assets we have from EWS where he was for five and half years, into the global PSOL channel. So, it\u2019s not just the large indirect resellers who give me hope for long-term growth in PSOL, it\u2019s the four levers we talked about plus taking other data assets into PSOL. Andrew Jeffrey : And, I\u2019ll ask you I guess the same question around Workforce Solutions. It seems like every year there is another wrinkle, another innovation, another customer; has this been an exceptional period given developments like ACA where you\u2019d say hey that this was just a remarkable time, or are we looking at the pace of change and an opportunity set that is structurally bigger than you might have thought it was two or three years ago? Rick Smith : It\u2019s the latter and it\u2019s by far the latter. I can see a day where this businesses so dramatically bigger than it is today, not just in U.S. but global. Andrew we are going wake up ex number of years, and it\u2019s going to be a couple of more geographies that are really important to us. I talked about trended data. We are just now in early days with trended data; we\u2019re building the capabilities for trended data. So, I would be remiss if I would say the leadership that was there was outstanding; they did a hell of a job and I am sure -- and Dann has done a hell of a job out there as you know and we\u2019ve seen the financials. We\u2019ll continue that progress and take this business to next level. And it\u2019s not farfetched to see at some juncture EWS being bigger than our core 117-year old credit business at margins equal to if not higher than USIS. So that\u2019s kind of how we think about that. John Gamble : If regulation continues to extend, the opportunities to expand the compliance business, so it\u2019s not just verifiers, it\u2019s in employer as well, both side of the business. Andrew Jeffrey : Okay, that\u2019s pretty ambitious and pretty exciting. Thanks. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question with Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs. Andre Benjamin : Thank you. I think most of my questions have been answered. I guess on the back of the question that was just asked about the EWS, it\u2019s clear that there is a lot of demand for these solutions globally. I guess in the U.S., is there any place that you can call out as a major area of focus beyond -- I think most of us clearly get the case in autos, mortgage, and government, but are there very obvious large areas that you should be going after that you are not today? Rick Smith : No, I think we\u2019ve got our toes into everything but it\u2019s all relative, it\u2019s -- I hate this baseball analogy but again, are we in the bottom half of first inning or the top half of the ninth inning. In most cases, we are very early stages. So, the credit card is important to us, the insurance is important to us, prescreening is important to us. So, thinking about anywhere we are having affirmation that someone is employed and the confirmation how much someone makes across almost every vertical, there is a need to that. So, we are into virtually all of them Andre, but there are some, we\u2019re very, very early days where penetration has got years to go. Andre Benjamin : And on PSOL -- I apologize if you covered this before I jumped on. But, I know you took up the growth rate longer term. And was there anything in particular about the re-org that should drive a material change in the strategy or is it really just getting everyone on the same page, seeing the same numbers and having unified goals? Rick Smith : Good question. It\u2019s the latter. Structure does not necessarily always facilitates faster growth or in fact growth to be slower. This is -- it just intellectually makes sense to have one team manage every aspect of the strategy for consumer regardless of how the consumer buys that product, directly from us or through a partner of our. So that\u2019s why we did that. I don\u2019t think that in itself changes the growth profile. It\u2019s executing against the four-pronged strategy we laid out last year that gives us confidence that the growth of PSOL multiyear model is slightly higher than past. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Brett Huff with Stephens. Brett Huff : Good morning, Rick, John and Jeff; and congrats on a nice job. Rick Smith : Thank you Brett Huff : Two questions; one, just focusing on EWS; you talked about the geographic expansion opportunity. The way I understand that business works, you need a database of numbers in order to really start having a product to sell. And you mentioned you had teams on the ground in several geographies. Are they just there constructing that database and kind of how long does it take to get to a scalable product in those geos? And then I have one follow-up. Rick Smith : It\u2019s going to take a while. This is -- when I think about the multiyear model we communicated earlier, it does not contemplate internationally, and I would never do that. So, it\u2019s going to take a while to build that database. But we\u2019re good at it; we know how to do it; we get funds invested into it; we\u2019ve got people invested into it; we\u2019ve got customers we know very well; we\u2019ve got the technology; we\u2019ve got the platforms; we know how to do. We think it\u2019s a lot of good. This is something you look at over a five-year period of time and say got it, now it\u2019s growing revenue versus fourth quarter 2016. Brett Huff : And then just a bigger picture question; I\u2019m trying to check off all I think are the major growth opportunities; wondered if you could just rank them in terms of your excitement? I guess the categories are trended data, Cambrian, the NPI/EGI and maybe talking about Work Number going International; maybe there is another one or two I\u2019m missing. But as you think about the three-year opportunity in those, which ones are -- kind of how do you rank them? Rick Smith : We\u2019re so good at, we\u2019ve done for so long is NPI and EGI. So that\u2019s something that obviously is investor or analyst thinking about it. So, we have a level of confidence and continuing it the way, just continue it if not higher. You alluded to the core EWS which was talked about quite a bit this morning, continue to grow international EWS obviously is one. Cambrian, you can\u2019t underestimate Cambrian. Cambrian will not only allow us to link to different data assets together but build product s you could not never build before but build them faster. So, time to revenue would be faster with Cambrian. Obviously small tuck-in acquisitions that were so good at, but hopefully we\u2019ll continue to be really good. So, we know how to do it. That will be a vehicle for profitable growth going forward. So, the cool thing is I think you\u2019d agree is it\u2019s not just one, two or three things we\u2019re counting on for growth. The foundation has been built by these -- our teams that have got so many levers to pull, it gives you a pretty good confidence. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Shlomo Rosenbaum : John, just one, could you verify for me? As I do my calculation on organic constant currency growth implied for 2016 revenue, it seems to me that the range is 7% to 10% with the midpoint to around 8.5%. Is that correct? John Gamble : That\u2019s what we got to. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. And then Rick, how concerned are you about the Australian economy and their tries to China and then impact of Veda or are you just really excited about all the opportunities to bring value over there and that\u2019s going to overwhelm that concerns that you might have from economic perspective over there? Rick Smith : Good question. Yes, we spend a lot of time trying to understand and deconstruct the economic drivers of the Australian economy, dependency on exports to China. We engage some of -- I think the best economic minds on a global basis as well as local basis in Australia to think about that and have locked away with a couple of thoughts, Shlomo. One is for 2016, unless there is an implosion that no one has ever contemplated in China, they have diversified their and their economy as such that in fact the consensus even today is the stronger GDP in Australia than 2015. The second thought I have is, they\u2019re going to have a session eventually. You can\u2019t define odds. I think they\u2019re the second longest running economy in history of modern time in the world, the China had a last recession; they are going to have one eventually. The third, we\u2019re making investment like this, we don\u2019t make any investment for a quarter, for a year, for two to three time. This is a part of the world we want to be in. We have great partner down there now with Veda. They give us lens into so many more geographies down there beyond just Australia and New Zealand. So, it\u2019s a generational bet, not to stay a quarter or a year bet. John Gamble : Shlomo, just a reminder, what we actually guided to on organic constant currency growth is high-end of the 6% to 8% range, so\u2026 Rick Smith : For the Company. John Gamble : For the Company. So that\u2019s -- it\u2019s within that range you indicated but the guidance was high end of 6% to 8%. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. William A. Warmington: So on the direct-to-consumer business, you\u2019ve talked in the past about your four-pronged strategy, indirect; International; Equifax.com; the freemium market. And you\u2019ve had some success there, especially on the direct-to-consumer resellers, Credit Karma and LifeLock. So, I wanted to ask how sensitive is -- or economically sensitive is this business. And then, if it is economically sensitive, how strong are the trends towards credit literacy and other demands in terms of ID, theft protection and other drivers on the secular side that could potentially offset it? Rick Smith : Yes. it\u2019s an interesting question. I\u2019ve not done a statistical correlation analysis between the GDP and PSOL business. So, if I gave you an answer, it would be wrong. But, I think about drivers mostly likely help individuals want to buy a PSOL product or products, it\u2019s am I employed; am I experiencing some wage stability if not inflation; am I in the market for something, those are tied together, right, helpful in the auto industry, if I\u2019m employed, home purchase and so on and so forth. So, I am not sure how to answer that. I\u2019ve not done a strong correlation analysis between what economic drivers and sensitivities drive PSOL up or down. William A. Warmington: Okay. Well, thanks. Operator : And we have no further questions in queue at this. I would now like to turn the conference back over to our moderator for any additional or closing remarks. Jeff Dodge : Okay. I\u2019d like to thank everybody for their time and their interest in Equifax and with that we\u2019ll conclude the call. Thanks everybody. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Bill Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities George Mihalos - Cowen and Company Operator : Good day and welcome to the Equifax First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Dodge. Please go ahead sir Jeff Dodge : Thanks and good morning. Welcome to today\u2019s conference call. I\u2019m Jeff Dodge, with Investor Relations. And with me today are Rick Smith, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, our Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today at www.equifax.com. During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in our filings with the SEC including the 2015 Form 10-K and our subsequent filings. During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA margin, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance for the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted EPS excludes acquisition related amortization expense, as well as the transaction and integration expenses associated with our acquisition of Veda. Adjusted EBITDA margin in defined as net income attributable to Equifax adding back income tax expense, interest expense net of interest income, depreciation, amortization and the impact of certain one-time items, including the transaction and integration expenses associated with our acquisition of Veda. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in the reconciliation tables which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our Web site. Also refer to the investor presentations which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our Web site for further details. Now, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Rick. Rick Smith : Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Thanks as always for joining us this morning on the call. Our first quarter performance certainly exceeded our expectations and further underscores the strength and the ability of this management team to consistently deliver results that meet or exceed the commitments we make to you our shareholders. And not only do we have the experienced leadership team, but the entire organizational rhythm is geared to the Management disciplines we\u2019ve created and built together over the last 10 or 11 years. Those disciplines are NPI enterprise growth initiatives, lien, growth playbook, account management etcetera. I could tell you one thing, this team is hungry and competitive to continue the winning streak that they\u2019ve been on now for a number of years. Our first quarter results are noteworthy as they\u2019re compared to a very strong performance in the first quarter of 2015. 2016 first quarter was a record quarter which is on top of a record year in 2015. For the quarter, total revenue was $728 million. That was up 12% on a reported basis and up 15% on a local currency basis from the first quarter of 2015. Organic constant currency revenue growth was very strong, up almost 11% over last year. Also in the quarter, foreign exchange created a $19 million year-over-year headwind. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 34.2% compared to 34.5% in the first quarter of 2015 and that was in line with our expectations when we guided for the full-year during our fourth quarter. [Indiscernible] and John will talk about that in detail, as will I, should you have any questions. Adjusted EPS was $1.23, up 15% from a $1.07 last year and significantly above the upper end of our guidance range. As always, before John gives you the financial details, I\u2019d like to briefly cover some highlights for the fourth quarter. As I always do, I will talk about the business units, specifically first and then transition into some corporate level highlights. And then John will take the financials. Starting obviously with USIS, they delivered solid 4% revenue growth in the quarter, double-digit growth in fraud, automotive, commercial, and mortgage resellers helped to offset slower growth in mortgage solutions, which as you know last year first quarter was really, really strong quarter for us. New product innovation is expected to have significant impact on USIS\u2019s future growth, while some of this has been driven by Cambrian, the initiatives in USIS, like the Company are very, very broad-based. Our current estimate sticking with USIS for 2016s class of new products are expected to have three-year revenue. That is double the estimate of our 2015 class. We'll talk more about NPI, at the Company level later on my comments, but it\u2019s off to a very, very good start for USIS. Also the pipeline of new products is much more robust than prior years. Our current pipeline is estimated to deliver significantly more revenue, incremental revenue growth, reflecting both greater market demand and are increasing investments in products. Cambrian, which you\u2019ve heard now about for a number of quarters. It\u2019s having a very positive impact with our customers. Since launching Cambrian, our mix of projects has shifted significantly towards multi-data sources and deeper insights from many of our customers, traditional decisioning activities. Data extraction and analysis time have been reduced by well over 50%, what that allows us to do is fail fast and I\u2019ve talked before, it shortens the cycle time to bring new products to market. Initial applications have addressed customer needs across diverse verticals, including banking, auto, telecommunications that\u2019s enabling us to leverage our entire customer base with unified technology and skill sets. Our work with Fannie Mae on trended data is on track and is expected to go live as we committed to you earlier in the year. It will go live at the end of June 1 to July of this year. IT integration with Fannie Mae, an ongoing platform for trended data is complete and our global operations teams is in the final stages of establishing their support readiness program, again anticipating at the end of June early July launch. USIS is expected to have another strong year in 2016, with growth at the lower end of the long-term range of 5% to 7%, despite our continued expectations for a flat to down mortgage market in 2016. EBITDA margins are expected to be at or above 50% for the year, which is slightly better than what we\u2019re expecting as we enter 2016. On the international, they delivered 30% local currency revenue growth benefiting from broad-based organic growth, which was above the upper end of the long-term growth model which is 8% to 10%. The growth was also obviously contributed from the support of the acquisition of Veda and John will go into a lot of detail on that. Within international, NPI has been and will continue to be an important growth driver for them. Innovation in international is very broad-based. For instance, in the first quarter, over 60% of new product revenue was driven by our customers\u2019 core decisioning activities. The remainder was driven by new solutions for high-value offerings in ID, authentication, data 360, fraud and debt management. The relationship with U.K. government for our Debt Management Services is strong and the initiative is off to a very good start. We\u2019ve five central government agencies operational -- operationalized, including the HMRC, which is, as you recall, the equivalent to our IRS. And this represents most of the debt that has been placed for collections. We\u2019ve placed over $800 million of debt with various agencies who are performing the analytics and the collections effort. Our data is fully integrated into the process of segmenting consumer and business accounts, to determine which agency is best suited to collect that particular segment. Revenue in international's four largest verticals, which are financial institutions, telcos, government, and SMEs, grew a very strong 12% in the quarter, which is very broad-based across verticals and countries. The decisioning platforms, analytical services and debt management revenue across international grew a very solid 19% in the quarter. These high-value solutions are deepening our relationship, customer relationships and strengthening our competitive position globally. Many of you know we\u2019ve delivered very healthy double-digit local currency growth in Latin America for a number of years, and we expect to do so again this year. Although the significant devaluation of the Argentine peso have a negative impact on our reported results in 2016. It appears that Argentina's new government is moving in the right direction to restore credibility in the financial markets. In fact, I just returned from Argentina and spend some time with our customers, government officials, and economists, and the outlook for Argentina in the next two, three, four years is as strong as I\u2019ve seen in my 10.5 years here. Across the region, in Latin America we\u2019ve a very good management team, a very strong market position and our strategy continues to resonate well with our customers. Finally, the integration of Veda is going very well. Our primary focus at this point is threefold. One is a thoughtful integration of the backroom processes. Two, deploying products and capabilities from around the Company that will add value to our local customers. And, three, ensuring that all of our customer facing teams in that region continue to service our customers well. We continue to expect International to have a strong 2016. Organic revenue growth should be above the upper-end of their long-term model, again which is 8% to 10%, with EBITDA margins improving sequentially throughout the course of the year as planned. On to Workforce Solutions, they delivered an outstanding 21% revenue growth and over 200 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion in the first quarter. Workforce Solutions continues to grow well above the upper-end of our multi-year model of 9% to 11%. That\u2019s really being driven through strong execution of their core strategic growth initiatives which are adding records to the database, new product innovation, pursuing new growth opportunities in different verticals such as automotive, credit card, healthcare and government. The growth continues to be very broad based across many verticals penetrating new customers and offering new products. Demand for Affordable Care Act solutions, known as ACA, with solutions for employers continue to be strong and our current outlook for the year is now ahead of the expectations we stated earlier in the year and you may recall those expectations earlier in the year expected very significant growth over 2015. So, that strength is getting even stronger as we move through 2016. We\u2019ve also identified other interesting opportunities to help employers with their ACA compliance. That includes things like the IRS Forms 1094 and 1095 and even beyond that. Workforce Solutions is emerging as a leader in what could be called compliance as a service to help employers solve increasingly complex compliance matters. A suite of services has expanded and we continued to look for new opportunities to align our services with these emerging needs. An example that\u2019s an emerging need is new regulation coming out around overtime pay changes and we\u2019re looking at leveraging our ACA analytic platform to solve those problems as well. EWS\u2019s NPI vitality index is expected to be very strong again this year, reaching approximately 13%. Their growth focus this year is on accelerating record growth in the work number database, deepening market penetration in targeted markets, again such as auto, cars, and government, and maximizing opportunities to help employers with their compliance needs. For it also continuing to solve employers\u2019 complex HR compliance challenges. Workforce Solutions should have another outstanding year in 2016 with revenue growth well above their long-term range of 9% to 11%. EBITDA margins should be in the high 40s, just shy of the long-term target we gave to you earlier in the year of 50%. On to Global Consumer Solutions, they also had an exceptional quarter with 16% local currency revenue growth and a 100 basis points margin -- 100 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion. Indirect revenue was up over 50% as the team continues to sign large deals with established companies who seek to deepen and broaden their relationships with consumers. Our customers and our pipeline is robust across multiple industries, including banking, retail, consumer products and services, as well as our expanding relationship that we established last year with Credit Karma. Mid single-digit revenue growth for our direct-to-consumer activities was consistent with our expectations and largely driven by higher average revenue per subscriber in the U.S and account acquisition outside the U.S. Global Consumer Solutions first quarter performance was outstanding and we now expect that they too will comfortably exceed their long-term growth target, comfortably delivering double-digit growth for the year. The adjusted EBITDA margin for the year is expected to exceed 30%. Before I go on to John, let me just give you a couple of highlights at the corporate level, and then John will give you the financials. Our enterprise growth initiatives are off to a very good start this year. Three of our four transformational initiatives are, one, developing the work number into a global exchange. Two, disrupting innovation by expanding our Cambrian platform throughout our global footprint; and, three, unifying our Global Consumer Solutions business with a single operating platform around the world that we call Renaissance. Let me jump into each of those for a second. We\u2019ve already completed the scope and the timeline for creating an income and employment verification exchange in a select group of our larger markets. We\u2019ve the platform, we\u2019ve a strong customer demand, and we\u2019ll be moving forward with this effort throughout 2016 and beyond. We are -- the initial focus for globalizing Cambrian will be in Canada, Argentina, and Australia. Canada will be the first; while other geographies will complete their initial assessment and define their requirements. We will give you an update on other countries as we exit 2016, but that bodes well for growth opportunities in \u201917, \u201918, and beyond. Our global IT platform supporting Global Consumer Solutions, again called Renaissance, is expected to go live this year. After deployment in our core markets of the U.S, Canada and U.K., we\u2019ll evaluate other market opportunities, obviously including Australia and Latin America. Cambrian has substantially enhanced our ability to provide unique, high value insights to our customers and it positions us well for the future. The platform can easily incorporate very contemporary analytic technologies, i.e., machine learning algorithms, analyze all types of unstructured data, and provide customers with dashboards customized to their specific needs. In Fraud, we\u2019ve applied machine learning algorithms to increase prediction by over 20%, by reducing false positives or know your customer, anti-money laundering, we are incorporating unstructured data to reduce false positives by approximately 60%. For one of our large customers, we are providing them with access to over 50 metrics on over 3 billion trade lines from their customers. We have created a dashboard portal that will be updated on a periodic basis. These types of services uniquely enable us to further deepen our customer relationships and position us as the premier source of insights on their consumers. Although in the early year, our new product pipeline for 2016 looks very promising. We expect year three revenue from our 2016 launches to be up significantly from 2015 product launches in their three-year revenue expectation, which as most of you may recall, 2015 class was up significantly over 2014. Two very solid product classes will fuel growth through 2018. Our lien -- our work with our customers leveraging our operational experience with lien is creating great client stickiness. The activities we are helping our clients with are numerous and include such things as mortgage lending, collections, auto lending, marketing and employee on-boarding. So again, the activities are far beyond their interaction with us just trying to make their processes more efficient. We\u2019ve also extended the program to International now and have either completed or have projects in the pipeline in countries such as the U.K. and Canada. We\u2019ve a number of clients where we\u2019ve repeat engagements, including two where we\u2019ve had five separate engagements at one company since 2014. Increasingly client leaders making Equifax a trusted advisor in times of change. With these relationships we are able to increase utilization of our products and services across the enterprise, identify new customer opportunities, reaffirm the value of our products and services, and support and strengthen long-term relationships. Our broad-based performance continues to position us very nicely to exceed the targets we set for ourselves and have committed to our employees, our customers, shareholders and consumers. We\u2019re now ending the second quarter with strong momentum and in many respects have yet to fully realize the benefit of a number of these strategic initiatives that were expected to make meaningful contributions, not only to this year, but again to 2017 and \u201918. With that, let me turn it over to John for the financials. John Gamble : Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As before, I\u2019ll generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis. As we indicated previously, with the Veda acquisition, we\u2019ll start focusing on adjusted EBITDA margin to more consistently present the operating performance of the segments and the Company as a whole. Adjusted EBITDA margin has been defined as adjusted net income plus depreciation, net interest expense and taxes. At the segment level, adjusted EBITDA margin is adjusted operating income plus depreciation plus net equity and other income. Given the change in our reporting structure, this metric will provide an improved understanding of segment performance as well as assessing their progress against our multi-year progress. The GAAP, non-GAAP reconciliation attached to our earnings release provides a more detailed description of what is included in the adjusted EBITDA margin. As you will recall, we\u2019ll be excluding Veda transaction expenses and integration expenses incurred through 1Q \u201917, the first year after the Veda acquisition from our adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA margin. In 1Q \u201916, total Veda transaction and integration pre-tax expense was about $22 million, virtually all of which was transaction related. $16 million of these pretax expenses are reflected as operating expense. Of this $16 million, $12 million are investment banking, legal and accounting advisor transaction fees and impact general corporate expense. The remainder of the operating expense was acquisition related employee compensation expenses at Veda, which is included in the International operating segment. Net FX losses related to Veda financing were approximately $6 million in the first quarter and are reflected as other income. As a reminder, we recognized $5 million in FX gains related to Veda financing in 4Q 2015. Looking forward, the remaining Veda transaction expenses will be incurred in 2Q \u201916 and should be relatively smaller, principally final legal and financial advisory fees related to completing required government filings and FX losses of approximately $3 million related to completion of the extinguishment of certain Veda debts. Veda integration expenses will increase in 2Q \u201916 as integration activities accelerate. Total Veda transaction and integration pre-tax expenses in 2Q \u201916 are expected to be approximately $7 million, which includes the $3 million in FX losses. Now let me turn to the business unit\u2019s financial performance for the first quarter. U.S Information Solutions revenue was $295 million, up 4% when compared to the first quarter of 2015, and consistent with our expectation. Online Information Solutions revenue was $218 million, up 5% when compared to the year-ago period reflecting double-digit growth in commercial information and fraud. Mortgage Solutions revenue was $32 million, up 1% compared to Q1 2015. Total mortgage related revenue in USIS was up 7% in the quarter, which compares favorably to the Mortgage Banker\u2019s Application Index, which was up 1% in the first quarter. USIS total mortgage revenue growth continues to outpace overall mortgage market growth consistent with their historic performance. Although the mortgage market was slightly better than we anticipated for the quarter, our full-year outlook for mortgage origination remains the same as last quarter at flat to down slightly. On to Financial Marketing Services in which revenue was $45 million, up 1% when compared to the year-ago quarter. The adjusted EBITDA margin for U.S Information Solutions was a strong 48.7%. As expected, this was down from the very strong 50.8% delivered in the first quarter of 2015, reflecting the very strong mortgage market in 1Q \u201915. In addition, this decline reflects increased legal expenses versus 1Q \u201815. Legal expenses incurred in any given period can be choppy and excluding this increased legal expense, the adjusted EBITDA margin for 1Q \u201916 would have been down only slightly versus the record levels of 1Q \u201915. Workforce Solutions revenue was $180 million for the quarter, up 21% when compared to the first quarter of 2015. Verification Services revenue of $99.2 million, up 16%, was driven by strong double-digit growth across mortgage, government, auto and pre-employment market segments. This reflects increased penetration with verifiers, as well as continued growth in records to the database. Employer Services revenue of $80.9 million, was up 29% from last year. Our traditional Employer Services businesses of unemployment claims, Watsi, I-9 validations and on-boarding, performed well with combined revenue growth consistent with our long-term expectations in the mid single digits. Workforce Analytics had a very strong quarter, as 1Q \u201916 and 2Q \u201916 represent the first in which employers are providing Form 1095-C to employees as part of their annual tax filings and as required by the ACA. As these forms are principally delivered in the first half of the year, we expect this strong growth in Workforce Analytics to continue into 2Q \u201916. The Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margin was 49.5%, up from 47.3% in 1Q \u201915. This reflects the very strong growth of our higher margin verifier and Workforce Analytics businesses. Revenue from our combined USIS and Workforce Solutions businesses, which represent our total U.S B2B business activities, was $475 million, representing organic growth of over 10%. International\u2019s revenue was $158 million, up 17% on a reported basis and 30% on a local currency basis. Constant currency organic revenue growth, which excludes Veda revenue was slightly above our long-term range of 8% to 10%. By region, Europe\u2019s revenue was $61 million, up 10% in U.S dollars and 15% in local currency. Latin America\u2019s revenue was $43 million, down 11% in U.S dollars, but up 15% in local currency. As you probably know, Argentina\u2019s average FX rate in 1Q \u201916 depreciated almost 40% from 1Q \u201915. Argentina, when combined with the impact on the currency in Uruguay, contributed almost 75% of the negative foreign exchange impact on revenue in Latin America. Asia-Pacific revenue was $28 million, which is comprised mostly of revenue from Veda, as well as revenue from net positive and our TDX debt management operations in Australia. Our current debt management revenue in Australia is very small. As a reminder, the Veda transaction closed on February 24 with Veda being a part of Equifax for about 40% of the quarter. Canada revenue was $28 million, down 10% in U.S dollars, but flat in local currency. We saw continuing improvement in Equifax Canada during the second half of 2015, both in terms of revenue growth and, importantly, the pipeline of new products we expect to begin to deliver revenue later in 2016 and 2017. This flat performance in 1Q \u201916 reflects the relative weakness of the Canadian economy we referenced on our last earnings call. We expect improved performance as new products ramp later this year. For the first quarter, International\u2019s adjusted EBITDA margin was 25.3%, and as expected, down slightly from 1Q \u201915. The slight decline reflects the benefit of adding higher margin Veda, as well as improved EBITDA margin performance and debt management, which was offset by a decline in EBITDA margin in Latin America. This decline in Latin America is due to the substantial weakness of local currencies. A portion of our cost is in U.S dollars, which does not benefit from the devaluation of the currency. Over the remainder of 2016, in International, we expect to show EBITDA margin growth reflecting revenue growth in our high margin countries coupled with the cost benefits of the regionalization program started last year. Global Consumer Solutions revenue was $95 million, up 14% on a reported basis and up 16% on a local currency basis. Global Personal Solutions showed growth across all channels, DTC, indirect and direct, and the strong growth in the quarter driven by -- principally by DTC and to a lesser extent our other channels. For the first quarter, the adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.8%, up 100 basis points from 1Q \u201915. This reflects strong revenue growth and leverage against GCS support costs. In the first quarter, general corporate expense of $71.6 million was in line with our expectations and down 9% from last year. One-time items impacted both 1Q \u201916 and 1Q \u201915. As I mentioned earlier, Veda integration expenses impacted corporate expense by just over $12 million in 1Q \u201916. As you will remember, in 1Q \u201915 we executed an organizational restructuring which impacted corporate expense by $23 million. Excluding these items, general corporate expense was approximately $59 million in 1Q \u201916, an increase of about $4 million or about 8%. For the second quarter, we expect general corporate expense to be in the range of $55 million to $60 million, including the Veda integration expenses. The adjusted EBITDA margin at 34.2% was down from 34.5% in 2015 and consistent with our expectations for the quarter. The reduction reflects the expected declines in USIS and International that we discussed earlier, partially offset by very strong EBITDA margin performance at both Workforce Solutions and Global Consumer Solutions. We expect to see year-over-year growth in EBITDA margins in each of the second through fourth quarters and continue to expect 2016 EBITDA margins to be approximately 75 basis points from the 34.7% we achieved in 2015. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 33.5%, which was in line with our expectations. Our adjusted effective tax rate, excluding the tax impact of the Veda transaction integration expenses, was 32.7%. This was consistent with the 33% guidance we had provided. For the remainder of 2016, we expect our effective tax rate to be slightly below this level, approaching 32%. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $40 million. We continue to expect capital expenditures for the year to be at the high end of our long-term range of 5% to 6% of revenue. This reflects expected spending related to the integration of Veda. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $90 million and consistent with our expectations. Operating cash flow was down from 1Q \u201915 due to working capital movements. We continue to expect strong growth in cash flow year-over-year for 2016. Total debt in the quarter was $3.08 billion, slightly below our expectations. Yesterday we filed a Form 8-K with the required Veda financial information, as well as a new shelf registration statement which will give us the flexibly to take advantage of market windows to refinance a portion of the Veda acquisition debt. As we indicated last quarter, we\u2019ll suspend our share repurchases during 2016 and focus on very strong cash flow and debt reduction and returning our leverage to a level consistent with our target leverage. We\u2019ll, however, continue with acquisitions beyond Veda in 2016 with a goal of delivering 1 to 2 points of additional ongoing revenue growth. Finally, you will recall that in our 2016 calendar year guidance, we had indicated that we expect revenue from Veda of $220 million to $230 million, and that we expect a benefit of Veda to adjusted EPS of $0.10 to $0.15 per share. In addition, when we provided our outlook for 1Q \u201916, we did not include any impact from Veda. As we indicated at that time, once we had completed the initial integration of Veda into our financial statements and had progressed in the transition of Veda to U.S GAAP accounting, we\u2019d provide an update to these estimates. Based on the completion of this work to date, we are increasing our full-year expectation for EPS accretion to approximately $0.20 per share. Our expectation for revenue in 2016 is now $230 million to $235 million, which reflects improved growth expectations partially offset by a larger negative impact on revenue recognition from the movement to U.S GAAP accounting. Veda\u2019s performance in 1Q \u201916 was consistent on a pro rata basis with these expectations. Acquisition amortization in 2016 from the Veda acquisition is expected to be approximately $65 million. Now let me turn it back to Rick. Rick Smith : Thanks, John. As I give you guidance for the second quarter and for the balance of the year, just to clarify, that does not assume any additional M&A at this juncture. So it\u2019s obviously the full-year of Veda in the numbers plus organic growth. And as John alluded to in his comments, we\u2019re expecting to do additional tuck-in M&A this year. That\u2019s just not in the guidance I\u2019m about to give you. I wanted to make sure that was clear. For the second quarter, we\u2019re increasing our outlook for both revenues and adjusted EPS. We now expect revenue, including Veda, to be between $795 million and $805 million, reflecting constant currency revenue growth of 20% to 22%. That\u2019s partially offset by 3% of FX headwind. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.34 and $1.36. That\u2019s up 17% to 18% over 2015. Excluding $0.03 per share of negative impact from FX, this reflects constant currency organic EPS growth of 19% to 21%. With our strong first quarter performance and second quarter -- and outlook for the second quarter, we\u2019re also increasing our full-year outlook for the year. We expect revenue, including the impact of Veda, to be between $3.05 billion and $3.15 billion, reflecting constant currency revenue growth of 17% to 20%, again partially offset by 2 to 3 points of FX headwind. This is up from the previous guidance of $3.0 billion to $3.1 billion and will move us nicely above the high-end of our multi-year financial model of 6% to 8% organic growth. And we also, as I mentioned earlier, expect potential additional growth through acquisitions as our pipeline is strong, but not included in that outlook. Adjusted EPS for the year is expected to be between $5.15 and $5.25, which is up 14% to 17% year-on-year. Excluding approximately $0.12 per share of negative impact from FX, this reflects constant currency EPS growth of 17% to 19%. This too is up from the $4.95 to $5.05 that we guided to during the fourth quarter earnings call a few months ago. We also continue to expect as John had mentioned, we expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to continue to expand by approximately 75 basis points for all of 2016. So with that, operator, we\u2019d like to open-up to any questions we may have from our audience. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will the first question from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Manav Patnaik : Yes, thank you. Good morning, gentlemen, and congratulations on the strong start to the year. I just wanted to first pick on, I think if I heard you right, you made some comments around trying to expand Workforce Solutions to other regions and you already had some increase in leads. I was hoping you could elaborate a bit more on that and what sort of timeline we should expect for some sort of replication of the data base you have here in those regions? Rick Smith : Sure, Manav. It\u2019s an important part of our multi-year strategy. We -- as I alluded to in the prepared comments, we\u2019ve the technology platform exchange that will be moving to different parts of the world. We\u2019ve strong customer interest. We\u2019re going to be very focused in the countries which we go. That process is already underway. Places like Australia, Canada, the U.K. and India are ones that we\u2019re moving on right now. Think of it as a multi-year kind of contributor versus something where we all wake up tomorrow and there is a dramatic change. This is going to be a nice contributor to us. It is not contemplated -- when I talk to our investors and [indiscernible] and others about kind of multi-year financial outlook for EWS, that revenue was not contemplated, so this would be on top of that growth, which I have met with a number of customers internationally, as did Dan, when Dan was in the role and now as Rudy. And I can tell you the interest is very, very high and we\u2019ve the unique technology to do -- to satisfy those needs in those parts of the world. Manav Patnaik : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And I guess it seems like you emphasize the guidance, not including any future tuck-ins. Is that -- am I reading that too much into saying that there is probably a pipeline in the near-term we should see and maybe which areas we should expect that in? Rick Smith : Yes, our pipeline is good. My whole focus to date has been getting Veda integrated properly. The team\u2019s focused on that, bringing products to Australia, New Zealand, and they\u2019re doing that. But at the same time, we\u2019ve a strategy. That strategy has resulted in a pipeline and we\u2019re moving forward on that. So, while it\u2019s not in the guidance, yes, to be very, clear, you should expect that we do a few strategic tuck-ins throughout the balance of the year. Manav Patnaik : Again, and just last one for me, and it sounds like obviously there is a lot of internal momentum going on at Equifax. A lot of -- your peers are doing pretty well as well. Is there any -- I guess, could you provide some color on how we should maybe try and understand the high growth rates in terms of the extra cent coming from just macro tailwinds or industry tailwinds versus the remaining coming from just pure internal innovation? Rick Smith : I think, our long-term model is 1 or 2 points of kind of market kind of growth. And as you know, the balance of the growth is we call initiatives, which are internal organic stuff. I\u2019d say the markets around the world are consistent with that model. We are not -- you are seeing some areas of good growth like automotive in the U.S but I\u2019d not say there is anything that\u2019s significantly changing the market dynamics of growth beyond the 1 or 2 points we talk about and have talked about for years. So, it continues to be largely driven by internal initiatives, including NPI, EGI, and others. Manav Patnaik : All right. Thanks a lot, Rick. Rick Smith : Sure. Thank you. Operator : We will hear next from Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs. Andre Benjamin : Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to talk a bit about Workforce Solutions. Clearly the growth there has been probably surprising, leaving your own expectations. Could you maybe help us frame kind of what the TAM would look like there over, say the next five years? And then where you believe you\u2019re the most penetrated today versus just getting started? Rick Smith : Yes, I continue to talk about EWS as being an unbelievable growth story for us, not just since we bought it nine years ago, but over the next 10 years. And I like to describe it, Andre, as being very early stages of its growth. What I mean by that is, we\u2019ve talked to you and others about our path to 300 million records and we\u2019re well on our way to that. That\u2019s a huge lever for growth. We\u2019ve talked about further penetrating verticals in the United States. And you heard John talk about great growth, broad-based growth in government collections, auto, card, mortgage, with the penetration level there it\u2019s so early, and it was many, many years of growth still to be had there. Third is the analytics. I alluded to that, John has alluded to that. It\u2019s growing dramatically year-on-year. It was a good growth driver last year. That\u2019s got a number of years of growth left in it. And then, we\u2019re now trying to take that platform and take it to other areas I alluded to, overtime pay is an example, IRS, 1094 and 1095. And then, lastly, it\u2019s taking the work number exchange and technology platform we\u2019ve and capabilities globally. So, when you couple that together, there are so many years of growth left in that business. Is it always going to grow with it -- what was it, 21%, John, in the first quarter? But we gave you a very robust multi-year growth, and I clearly expect that business for as long as I can see, to grow within that range that we\u2019re committed to. Andre Benjamin : And then on the PSOL business, you mentioned you continued to sign more partnerships there. How do you think about the sequential growth rate for that business as the partnerships that you\u2019ve signed recently scale and you continue to add new ones? And then, I guess, based on the list of partners that I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve that you can continue to add to your list of partners, how do we think about how sustainable it is to keep growing above kind of the longer term rate that you\u2019ve laid out? Rick Smith : Yes, I gave you the guidance for this year. It\u2019s going to be a very good year for PSOL. They\u2019ve signed up. As you know, we have a Credit Karma relationship from last year. We\u2019ve got another big player that I think has been publicly announced, they announced it last year in LifeLock. But then we\u2019ve all these other great indirect partners that these guys are signing up. So, I\u2019m very bullish for Global Consumer this year. They will be at or nicely above their multi-year model. And again, Dan is doing a great job now of taking that capability and not just looking at U.K., Canada, our two international platforms, but looking at other opportunities in other parts of our globe that we can take that Renaissance platform we earlier referred to, which is a core platform, and bring it to other markets and grow outside the current footprint. Andre Benjamin : Thank you. Rick Smith : Thanks. Operator : Brett Huff from Stephens. Please go ahead. Brett Huff : Good morning, Rick, John, Jeff, and congrats on a nice quarter. Rick Smith : Thanks, Brett. Brett Huff : On the USIS, I think you walked through a little bit about why that revenue growth decelerated, but can you just give us more commentary on sort of that core business here in the U.S., both how you\u2019re seeing the macro maybe by vertical or something like that? And then also kind of what your innovations are really focused on there that\u2019s going to maybe reaccelerate that growth in the back half of the year? Rick Smith : Sure. I\u2019ll jump in and John, if I miss something, please add to it. One, I tried to be very direct in my guidance when we wrapped up 2015, when I talk about USIS knowing that 2015 first quarter and really the first couple of months of the second quarter were very, very, very strong. I mean, the growth rate for mortgage in 2015 over 2014 in USIS in the first quarter was extremely strong double-digit. So we knew there was some headwind there. So, when I guided for USIS, or we guided for USIS, I said it would be at the low end, if not below the low-end of a multi-year range. So it came in exactly where we expected it and it\u2019s largely driven by those comps in mortgage. But it just remains very healthy. It\u2019s got those first two quarters of headwind that it\u2019s going to have to get through. The great thing is we\u2019ve got great balance across the portfolio. Number two is, if you think of NPI, it takes a while to gain momentum. And they started building some momentum late last year, late to mid last year. That momentum is continuing now. So the number of products they have, like the rest of the Company, are broad across many verticals. Obviously, the one we\u2019ve talked about with the investors that will pay big dividends in the second half of the year is the launching of trended data for USIS. And that goes live, as I alluded to in the third quarter of this year. So, automotive continues to be a good market for us in USIS; everything else I described is a stable economic environment. I think John did a great job. When you think of the U.S business, USIS, we separate two entities. We call one EWS; we call the other USIS. You think about many of the activities are going on when you compare ourselves to others in the U.S marketplace. A fair way to look at it, I think, for you guys is to compare either all of EWS in with USIS or you take the Verification Services and Analytics, which is healthcare, and look at it that way. When you look at it that way, as John said, you\u2019re getting double-digit growth. And that\u2019s the way we look at the business. We bring all of our products to bear to our customers and it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s an analytics for healthcare company, if it\u2019s a work number record or if its fraud, identity, management or credit file. They\u2019re all solving problems for customers in the U.S, and that\u2019s a strong, healthy, double-digit growth. John Gamble : We saw great growth in identity and fraud all last year and again in the first quarter of this year, very good growth in commercial last year, and again in the first quarter of this year. So, as Rick said, very broad-based and not forgetting very high EBITDA margins. Last year\u2019s EBITDA margins were 51%, adjusting for legal, almost at that level this year. So, very, very strong performance. Rick Smith : Good point. Brett Huff : Great. That\u2019s helpful. And just one other question from me. You gave us sort of the $800 million, I think, of debt from the U.K. that you\u2019ve been working through. Can you -- any more insight on sort of the ultimate size of that if you\u2019ve more line of sight to that? And any broad thoughts on economics to you all and how that revenue model might work as it evolves? Thank you. Rick Smith : It\u2019s going well, Brett. So, overall the debt management platform, which, as you guys know by now, was TDX and it was this business we call Inffinix, which we bought in Mexico. So we are combining those capabilities; we are taking up those offerings global. So the growth rate is beyond just the government contract in the U.K. and we are gaining traction around the world. Hopefully we\u2019ll have some nice wins to report later on in the year outside of the traditional footprint. But specific to the government contract, it\u2019s ramping up as expected. And as John alluded to and I have alluded to in the past, as that revenue continues to ramp, the international EBITDA margins will continue to expand nicely. So it\u2019s on track as expected. It will be a nice contributor this year to the topline and profits. John Gamble : And we just continue to caution people that given it\u2019s our first big contract with the U.K. government like this, that in terms of the level of growth rate, we\u2019re just going to have to tell you what the growth rate is going to look like as it occurs, because this is the first contract of this size we\u2019ve had with the government like this. Brett Huff : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We will hear next from Otto Garrett from Deutsche Bank. Otto Garrett : Hi. Congrats on the great quarter. Just one quick clarification on your guidance for Veda. You increased the guidance for the year there to $230 million, $235 million. That\u2019s for the balance of the year? That doesn\u2019t include your contribution in the first quarter? John Gamble : Now that\u2019s for the full-year. $230 million and $235 million is for the full-year. Otto Garrett : Okay, great. And then also just looking at your relationship with Fannie Mae, saw a release earlier in the quarter that you guys expanded your relationship there to provide a monthly credit updates for their Connecticut Avenue risk securities? Can you just give us the size in there, like what the contribution of that might be? Rick Smith : Small. Otto Garrett : Small, okay. That\u2019s all for me. Thank you. Rick Smith : Great. Thank you. Operator : David Togut from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Togut : Thank you. Good morning, and congrats on the superior performance in the quarter. Just a quick question on the Employer Services business, I\u2019m used to thinking about this business as being countercyclical and typically a slower growth business than the verification business at this point in the cycle? Is this because of the contribution you are now seeing from Workforce Analytics that you are getting this high 20s growth or are there other big drivers that would tend to, let\u2019s say, modulate the countercyclicality of that business? Rick Smith : That\u2019s a good question and there is no doubt about it that the analytics push that we\u2019ve had is fueling great growth there and will continue to fuel great growth for the next couple of years, but it\u2019s also changing mindset. We used to always assume that the employer business was there to feed records into the verification side and it would be countercyclical. So if unemployment claims rise, that business would grow as it did in 2009, 2010. We\u2019ve changed our views there. We\u2019ve been investing over the years fairly heavily in platforms and capabilities. We changed the mindset of the leadership team there to think of it as a growth business. So, what you\u2019re getting is clear growth in analytics, but also growth in the core non-analytics businesses with an employer. Not at the same rate as analytics, but when you put the two together, you get really good growth. John Gamble : And just specific to the first quarter, as we mentioned, right, excluding analytics, the other businesses grew mid single-digit, which is consistent with our expectation. So, great growth from Workforce Analytics. Please do remember, in general, Employer Services is stronger in the first quarter, because of work opportunity tax credits. The revenue there is skewed toward the front half of the year. David Togut : Understood. Thank you. Congrats on the strong quarter. Rick Smith : Thanks, David. Operator : We will hear next from Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets. Gary Bisbee : If I could first follow-up on that last one. So, you mentioned the forms related to the Affordable Care Act hitting in the first and second quarter. Is that -- How does the revenue model work for the Workforce Analytics? Is there a separate billing for that so the revenue would then fall off in the second quarter? And should that -- should we think about that as within the year-to-year growth calculation, or is the seasonality of that going to change a lot? Rick Smith : Let me jump in. It\u2019s not the analytics that was unusual in the first quarter, it was the tax credits. Gary Bisbee : Okay. John Gamble : Yes, so Workforce Analytics, which is part of Employer, the general seasonality of their revenue will be higher in the first quarter and second quarter and then lower in the back half, specifically because the revenue model -- the revenue is generated based on the level of activity executed. And it\u2019s a deferred revenue model, right. So any revenue that -- any work that\u2019s done upfront prior to delivery of the product had to be put on the balance sheet and amortized over the period in which the product is delivered. So you end up seeing more revenue during the period of delivery, which is the first half of the year and less revenue in the back half. Was that the question you were getting to? Gary Bisbee : Yes. So, I understand that mechanic historically, is that different now, because I think you referenced \u2026.? John Gamble : No, it\u2019s just bigger. It\u2019s just way bigger, right. So the business is growing dramatically, so that dynamic is just bigger in the overall growth rate of the Employer Services segment. Gary Bisbee : Great, thanks. And then, the bigger question, so you referenced the second straight year of sharply higher expected revenue from the innovation pipeline. Are there a couple of factors that have led to such robust improvement for the last few years and, I guess, what are they? I mean it seems like you\u2019ve had such strength, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just the culmination of years of focus -- focusing on and talking about innovation or technologies changed or more places where you\u2019re selling multiple services. What are the key factors that have driven this? And is it sustainable or is it -- do you think you\u2019ve just hit a spot that\u2019s great, but then will normalize at some point? Rick Smith : I think if you think about it, one, it\u2019s the maturation process. We\u2019ve been in NPI in the Company, I think, since 2006, so as you mature it just becomes more effective. Two, we launched, as you recall, NPI 2.0 maybe two years ago. We kind of revamped the enthusiasm, the approach towards NPI. Clearly, that\u2019s paying dividends as you get other -- more businesses into the game in a broader way. We talked that USIS now ramping up. We\u2019ve talked about Canada ramping up in NPI. And lastly, you can\u2019t ignore the fact that the technology platforms we\u2019ve invested in that facilitate the ability to build products faster, like Cambrian, building platforms like TotalView which allow our customers to consume multiple products quicker. So the combination of maturation NPI 2.0 plus the technology platforms like Cambrian and TotalView that we\u2019ve invested in, are all facilitating unbelievable strength in innovation around the world. Gary Bisbee : And just one last one, how much of that also is the vertical expansion? Is that technology and what you just described more important or do you say today versus two years ago having a lot more progress? Rick Smith : Yes it\u2019s great -- that\u2019s a great question, Gary. I\u2019d say, that\u2019s a really good question. What you end up doing when you verticalize the Company as we\u2019ve done in the last five or six years is you now have domain expertise in the vertical, so you\u2019re building specific products with great insight and knowledge to solve the problems in those verticals and we couldn\u2019t do that before. So, there is no doubt that having domain expertise in verticals facilitates greater knowledge and has faster or more NPI. Gary Bisbee : Great. Thank you. Rick Smith : Sure. Operator : Tim McHugh from William Blair & Company. Your line is open. Tim McHugh : Most of my questions have been asked, but just quickly, I guess, the ACA related revenue after this first year push, how optimistic are you about being able to continue to grow on top of that or is this kind of a one-time step up as you look at it? Rick Smith : No, Tim, it\u2019s not a one-time step up. It\u2019s -- and I tried to give you some text around that in the prepared comments, but it is a great growth this year. We\u2019re going to continue to expand the capabilities. I talked about 1094 and 1095 with the IRS. We talked about bringing the platform to overtime pay compliance; we\u2019ve talked about bringing once we get the work number up and running internationally, bringing the analytics platform we built for ACA in other parts of the world. So, now it\u2019s an integral part of our growth strategy for EWS globally. John Gamble : And the customer base that we can apply the core ACA capability to is broader than we currently want. So there is more customers just within the core application. Tim McHugh : Okay. And are you at this point, with -- I know there was a number of companies that provided ACA solutions for basically rushing to try and get fully implemented with all their clients in time. Were you able to do that or is there still even a backlog of clients you haven\u2019t, I guess, weren\u2019t fully implemented with that will continue to help drive the growth as well? Rick Smith : Yes, there is no doubt there are other players in the marketplace. We think we\u2019ve a unique value proposition versus many of them, but there is some good competitors. Number two is the pipeline continues to grow. Number three is when the fine start to be levied to these companies later on this year, that can create an awareness and concern that\u2019s going to facilitate even a stronger pipeline as we exit this year and go into 2018. Tim McHugh : Okay, thanks. Rick Smith : Sure. Operator : Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Toni Kaplan : Good morning. You mentioned that the Veda integration is on track. Just trying to think about how would you expect to see opportunity of building out the products in Australia will take, like basically cross-selling some of your products that you\u2019ve in other regions? I imagine it might be in multi-year endeavors, so just -- how should we think about sort of the incremental growth in the outer years? Rick Smith : Yes, Toni, we think about the Company as being a very well-run Company, an established Company, a Company that\u2019s respected in the regions in which it play. So we\u2019re buying really good assets that\u2019s got good growth. We\u2019ve already given the Company a multi-year model for that which is at or above all multi-year organic growth model. Two, there will be some M&A opportunities as we get to know that part of the world better which add to the growth. Number three is bringing products like our fraud products, Cambrian, TotalView, Interconnect and others, Work Number, PSOL, to Australia will help grow. Right now it\u2019s all about making sure we keep this asset focused on customers, get the backroom integrated properly, build a multi-year plan. It\u2019s not going to be a big bang on the transfer of products or knowledge. It will rather be a very thoughtful transfer of those capabilities over many years to continue to grow that business nicely. Toni Kaplan : Okay, great. And just a big picture question, on the consumer monitoring space, how do you see that evolving over the coming years? Rick Smith : Are you talking about the PSOL, the direct-to-consumer business? Toni Kaplan : Yes. Rick Smith : Yes, I think it\u2019s evolving as we expected and communicated in the past that\u2019s there will be a world of free and there will be a world of pay. Those two will coexist together. I think long-term the growth is going to be greater in the free, which means the paid model around the world will be slower growth, but still viable, still profitable, still growing. Toni Kaplan : Thank you. Rick Smith : Sure. Operator : We will move on to Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust. Andrew Jeffrey : Thanks. Good morning, guys. I appreciate taking the question. Rick Smith : Hi, Andrew. Andrew Jeffrey : Rick, you certainly have a laundry list that\u2019s impressive of new growth initiatives. I wonder if you could just kind of rank order, perhaps -- I know you probably love all of your children equally, but if you could kind of rank order where you think the greatest or most potent levers are to maintain this nice above trend performance you\u2019ve been putting up. Rick Smith : Thank you for the compliment. If I had to think about it over a multi-year kind of landscape versus a quarter \u2026 Andrew Jeffrey : Rick Smith : Yes, that would be helpful. Rick Smith : EWS, clearly. I mean, my god, that is -- I don't know how else to describe it other than it has many, many, many years of very solid topline, bottom line growth. And we talked about it getting up to 50% EBITDA margins over some time and high growth that is just unbelievable. Number two, the other growth lever I love and Gary asked about it is NPI. And its refreshing that NPI combination with the maturation and the technology bodes very well for the next five years. Number three, EGI. We are really clicking. Andy and his team are on our enterprise growth initiatives, large complicated multi-business in multi-country growth objectives. That\u2019s got a lot of growth left in it. I\u2019m really, over multiple years, very optimistic about taking the Veda platform and growing it. With Work Number going global, I think it\u2019s going to give us -- as I said before, when I bought the Company, it will give us access to other parts of that world with great scale. We already have great scale. We\u2019ve people in that part of the region, so we will do some acquisitions there. Trended data is going to be important to us, not just for Fannie, we\u2019ve been doing a lot of analytics around the KS list; we are getting by different verticals. So, I think that bodes well for us. And then maybe lastly is continuing to look at different geographies around the world we want to expand. Andrew Jeffrey : Okay. And is the Employer information -- pardon me, the Employer information exchange, is that an important potential subset within EWS when you think about that broadly? Rick Smith : Absolutely. Andrew Jeffrey : Okay. Rick Smith : Again, bringing that to other parts of the world is going to be a nice catalyst for multi-year growth. Andrew Jeffrey : Okay. And if I may, on trended data, you\u2019ve got a lot of really nicely differentiated solutions. That\u2019s one area where perhaps some of your competitors are citing pretty good growth. Can you talk about whether your trended data is materially differentiated from the competition? Rick Smith : Yes, I think so, because our assets are different. If you talk about the ability to trend utility database, who else can do that? If you talk about the ability to trend [indiscernible], who else can do that? If you talk about the ability to trend employment data, who else can do that? If you talk about the ability to trend income data? So, is the solutions we\u2019re providing for Fannie different than what TU is doing today? No, it\u2019s virtually the same. But the future is trending far beyond just Credit File, and that\u2019s where I think we are uniquely positioned. Andrew Jeffrey : Terrific. All right. Thank you. I appreciate it. Rick Smith : Sure. Operator : Judah Focal from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Judah Focal : Hi. Thank you for taking my call. A couple of quick bookkeeping questions. How much were the precise revenues from Veda in the first quarter? A - John Gamble About $25 million. Judah Focal : Great. And how much was the tax credit contribution and how does that compare to last year in the first quarter? Rick Smith : Are you -- Watsi, you\u2019re referring to an EWS? Judah Focal : Yes, Watsi, exactly. Rick Smith : I don\u2019t remember that. John Gamble : I don\u2019t have that specific detail. So, Watsi was very strong last year as well. Rick Smith : Year-on-year, I don\u2019t believe it was much different. Judah Focal : Okay, fine. So it didn\u2019t necessarily contribute to the growth that much? John Gamble : By far the biggest contributor to Employer Services Growth was ACA WFA. Rick Smith : And then verification. John Gamble : Yes. Judah Focal : Okay, perfect. And then, just one final question just on Global Consumer Solutions. Has something -- what would you say beyond adding new partners? What would you say is driving this massive revolution in this space? This was a turnaround going back a year or so ago and we\u2019ve seen now tremendous strength in this. And not just you, but some of your peers as well. So, how would you characterize the change maybe perhaps amongst consumer awareness and willingness to buy some of your solutions? Thank you. Rick Smith : Yes, sure. Thank you. Good question, Judah. So, one is we are -- we bought a company a number of years ago, TrustedID, and it takes a while to ramp up an indirect business. We\u2019ve done that now nicely. It took a while to get some momentum. Number two is we are partnering with some pretty good partners who are out there spending a lot of money, trying to advertise the product to the consumer. And obviously that builds over time; as they gain traction, we gain traction. So, it\u2019s a combination of multiple factors kind of coming together at one time. John Gamble : On your first question, Work Opportunity tax credit revenue was slightly higher, the growth rate in first quarter \u201916 and first quarter \u201915. It wasn\u2019t a major driver, but it was slightly higher. Judah Focal : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Up next we have Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, guys. Thank you very much for squeezing me in here. John, can you just walk through again the reason why the international margins were low? How much of the year-over-year difference was due to the currency impact by having your expenses in the U.S with the revenue and other currencies and how much were from some of the other things? John Gamble : Yes. So, we didn\u2019t give exact numbers, right. But effectively the drivers were -- biggest driver was Latin -- in terms of reduction, was Latin America. So Latin America, because of the really substantial devaluation of currencies, which is much larger than we\u2019ve seen in the last several years. We saw a margin impact there that was planned, it was expected to occur. And that is specifically related to the fact that we do have non-local currency expenses and all local currency revenues, so that the margins just don\u2019t benefit on both the top and bottom line in the same way. Canada margins were slightly down as well, because you saw Canada revenue was flat on a local currency basis, expenses were up slightly. So you had Canada marking down slightly, but the big driver was Latin America. And the positive side in terms of international margins that partially offset those declines were obviously the adding of Veda, because they had very good EBITDA margins. And then also, as Rick mentioned during his prepared comments and after, debt management grew and performed better. We took out some costs and we saw some better performance in overall margins in debt management. So, that -- those were the drivers of why you saw basically flat EBITDA margins in International. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. And so, the growth you\u2019re expecting in the EBITDA margins through the rest of the year is a -- basically a revenue leverage item? Is that the way we should think of it? John Gamble : So we will get some revenue leverage. We will also obviously get Veda for an entire quarter in the second quarter where we only had them for 40% of a quarter in the first quarter. And as we\u2019ve said, we are expecting to see some leverage in improved revenue performance in Canada as we move through the year. We are expecting to see also continued improved performance in Europe as we move through the year. So, generally speaking, the continued good revenue performance in International if you had for multiple years, we think it\u2019s going to drive some improved performance in EBITDA margin, as well as we are expecting cost performance improvements because of the regionalizations we started last year and we\u2019ve been talking about for the past year. Rick Smith : Hey, Shlomo, Rick here. Just one other thing. [Indiscernible] back to 5,000 feet on margins, if you think of EBITDA margins. Just two points. One, I think you will agree, our EBITDA margin is starting -- this is for the Company now, at a very high level. But I think we are in the top 25% of the S&P 500 or so for EBITDA margin. Secondly, we\u2019ve committed to approximately 75 basis points on top of what is already very high margin for the year. We reaffirmed we will deliver that this year. All the way we deliver that for the Company is if the individual components, including International, continue to improve and increase. So it\u2019s important we keep that in context. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Got it. I\u2019m just trying to understand where it\u2019s coming from. Also are you having success in getting the ACA clients to put the income data into the TALX database? It seems like a huge opportunity to in the longer term? Rick Smith : That\u2019s a great question, Shlomo. The answer is yes. And that success -- I\u2019ll give you some numbers in the past on these calls and that success will be further enhanced very shortly as we build a technology link that makes the transition from ACA into the Work Number database easier for our customers. So, that technology link and capability will go live in July of this year. Said another way, it\u2019s been a more manual, grind-it-out population of the [indiscernible] database from ACA clients. It will be far easier, more seamless for our customers starting in the third quarter. John Gamble : Shlomo, just to make sure we are clear, since we are using acronyms, I was referring to EBITDA margin and that was the answer I was giving was around EBITDA margin. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Got it. Okay. But -- and so the ACA, we should start to see more automated process of porting income data into the TALX database in July? And is that going to become kind of a regular part of your contracting for the ACA stuff to be able to put that into the TALX database as a default? Rick Smith : Absolutely. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. Very good. Thank you very much. Rick Smith : Thank you. Operator : We will hear next from Jeff Mueller from Baird. Jeff Meuler : Yes, thank you. So, I guess to continue the analogy from earlier, Rick, it sounds like you\u2019ve a lot of children and you love them all a lot. So you\u2019re sticking to the 6% to 8% longer term for now, operating above it this year, but it sounds like there is a lot of line-of-sight factors into \u201917 and \u201918 that you listed out. How do you think about sticking to 6% to 8% and within that framework, could you operate above it for several years at least? Rick Smith : Yes, I feel good about it. That\u2019s why we gave it. As we get into -- back into this year, if there is something from a macro perspective or internally that would drive me to reconsider a different range above that, we will do that at that time. But at this juncture, I think if we can consistently, year in, year out, deliver 6% to 8% topline organically, another point or two inorganically, and give you some capital structure leverage, operating leverage, and a nice dividend and give 13% to 15% return to our shareholders, I think that\u2019s a pretty damn good model, year in and year out. And you will find years move up [indiscernible] as we did last year, as we\u2019re on track to do this year, but multi-unit's a pretty doggone good model, I think, and hope you agree. Jeff Meuler : I absolutely agree. And then, on the relationships with the Credit Karma and the like, how are you expecting them to impact the market for credit card marketing or financial marketing? And is that an incremental revenue opportunity for you or is that within kind of the existing revenue relationship? Rick Smith : I never quite thought of it that way. I think anytime they are out there in the marketplace getting consumers to be interested about their credit and that results in a product that we sell-through Credit Karma or LifeLock or something else a consumer buys, that\u2019s kind of contemplated in today\u2019s model and tomorrow\u2019s model. I don\u2019t think it changes the financial representation of the relationship terribly. But, to be honest, I\u2019ve not given it a lot of thought. Jeff Meuler : Okay. And then just finally, do you guys -- are you willing to provide the verifications revenue growth split between mortgage and ex-mortgage? Rick Smith : No, we don\u2019t break out that level of detail. But as John said, I think I may have said too, the verification growth, which I think was 16%, is that right, for the quarter was broad based. And selling verticals, I think John [indiscernible] auto, car, government, mortgage and others. And not only that, it\u2019s so early days of penetrating those markets, so there is many years of growth beyond mortgage. And guidance we gave for EWS assumes a flat to slightly down mortgage market for the full-year. So it\u2019s going to have really good growth with mortgage decline over the balance of the year. John Gamble : Yes, we indicated mortgage, government, auto, pre-employment, all grew double-digit. Jeff Meuler : Great. Thank you, guys. Rick Smith : Thank you. Operator : Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Bill Warmington : Good morning, everyone, and congratulations on the strong quarter. A question for you on one of the other growers there that was growing double digits, which is commercial. And we haven\u2019t really heard much about commercial since it was absorbed into USIS and I wanted to ask what was going on there? Is it specific to what you guys are doing or is it something overall in the market or mix? Rick Smith : I would say it\u2019s a strong testament to leadership. And I mean that seriously. When we -- Brian, Tom, Madison, who is a seasoned executive for us and gave them, in addition to many other things, commercial and [indiscernible] in his past life when he ran USIS, those two guys rejuvenated the people, rejuvenated NPI within commercial. Strategically had a much different outreach, SPFE and/or customers and leadership of those two guys and their teams have done a remarkable job of restating -- reinstating a growth mindset into a business. Bill Warmington : And one more question on the FICO XD score. That\u2019s one where you\u2019re partnering with FICO and LEXIS-NEXIS and combining the utility data from NCTUE and the rental data from LEXIS-NEXIS. If you could talk a little bit about the revenue potential there for you. It sounds like it\u2019s potentially a premium-priced score. Rick Smith : Yes, Bill, when you think of all the growth levers that your peers have referenced in past commentary, and if I were to list 10 of them, maybe 15 of them, maybe 20 of them, I don\u2019t think that FICO score would make the list. There are so many other great things that we are doing that you and I should focus on and others should focus on. And this is obviously important to us, that particular FICO score with LN data and our data is de minimus when you think of moving the needle for us. Bill Warmington : Got it. All right. Thank you very much. Rick Smith : Sure. Operator : Your final question today will come from George Mihalos from Cowen. George Mihalos : Hey, thanks for squeezing me in, guys, and let me add my congrats on a very strong quarter. Rick, wanted to ask you, you spoke, obviously, positively about trended data, but ground zero for that is going to be the mortgage market. Looking beyond that, what are the verticals or the areas that you think could be potential early adopters or really make a big push for the product? Rick Smith : Three come to mind, automotive, card, and marketing, are the three that we\u2019re working on right now. George Mihalos : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, just a quick follow-up. The ACA analytics, as we look beyond 2016, given your comments on the strong pipeline, is it sort of safe to say that from an absolute dollar perspective you could have a similar increase in \u201917 versus what you are adding on in \u201916? Rick Smith : I don\u2019t know about that. But here is what you should know is -- and no one has said it, , it\u2019s the pipeline is really strong; two is when the fines come out, that pipeline is going to strengthen. Three is we are going to take it to different areas like 1095 -- 1094 and 1095 for IRS. And, four, we are going to take that product to different areas we haven\u2019t even thought about before as we become a compliance center expert. George Mihalos : Great. Thank you. Rick Smith : Sure. Thanks, everyone, for your questions. Operator, I think that\u2019s it. Again, we thank everybody for their interest and the time today and with that, operator, we will terminate the call. Operator *: And that does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. We thank you all for your participation.",

Operator : Good day and welcome to the Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Dodge. Please go ahead, sir Jeff Dodge : Thanks and good morning, everyone. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Jeff Dodge, Investor Relations and with me today are Rick Smith, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today at www.equifax.com in the Investor Relations section under the About Equifax tab. During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our businesses are set forth in our filings with the SEC including the 2015 Form 10-K and all subsequent filings. During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA margin, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance. For the second quarter of 2016, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes acquisition related amortization expense, as well as the transaction and integration expenses associated with our acquisition of Veda. Adjusted EBITDA margin in defined as net income attributable to Equifax adding back income tax expense, interest expense net of interest income, depreciation, amortization and the impact of certain one-time items, including the transaction and integration expenses associated with our acquisition of Veda. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in the reconciliation tables which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our Web site. Also, please refer to our investor presentations which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website for further details. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Rick. Rick Smith : Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Once again, thank you for joining us for our earnings call. As is normal practice, I will start by giving you some high-level overview on some financials and then with some highlights by the individual business units, come back and give you some insight on the major corporate initiatives, and John will take it from here and go to details on financials, and I'll come back with the summary and then we'll do Q&A. The second quarter performance continues to reflect outstanding execution across our business units, our verticals in our countries around the world. The team has developed good momentum which should carry us nicely through the remainder of the year and into 2017. Also, our Veda team has continued to deliver the performance that attract us to the company and they fully embrace the integration strategy. I'll give you more on that in a moment. I'm optimistic about the opportunities that the Australian Southeast Asian business will generate for us not just this year, but into the future. In the quarter, total revenue was $811 million at 20% on reported basis and up 22% on local currency basis from the second quarter of 2015. Organic and constant currency revenue growth accelerated from the first quarter, up very strong at 12%. Also in the quarter, FX equated $17 million of year-over-year headwind. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.6% compared to 35% in the second quarter of 2015, a very solid year-on-year increase. Adjusted EPS was $1.43, up 24% from $1.15 last year and better than our expectations when we got back in April. I'm now going on to some of the each and individual businesses starting with USIS. 3% revenue growth from the quarter, driven largely by mortgage originations, credit marketing activities, commercial information services and our fraud solutions with an adjusted EBITDA margin of over 50%. Trended data for mortgage industry is expected to go live on September 24. We've been delivering trended data to our customers since April of this year so they could develop familiarity with the contentment and understand the value to their underlying processes. We've already signed agreements with three of the largest mortgage resellers and we'll start billing for these services in August of this year. Revenue from our credit marketing services product offerings grew up with single digits, driven by double digit growth in both pre-screen and portfolio review offerings. We believe that the majority of this project will focus on new account acquisitions and cross-selling. The growth was also broad-based across all of our major verticals. The team continues to make very good progress on a commercial information database and solutions. We've been operating under numerous extensions of our agreement with the small business financial exchange. We've been developing an alternative database which we call the commercial financial network. We currently have over 1,200 institutions providing data for the database including some of the largest financial institutions and once again, our commercial business delivered double-digit growth for the quarter. Our fraud solutions revenue was primarily driven by customer needs to authenticate consumer identity for online access though it was broad-based including financial services, telco, government and our direct-to-consumer resellers. Year-to-date, new product revenue for USIS is ahead of our expectation, driven mostly by non-mortgage lending products and as you know, the NPI pipeline up and running, that bodes well for the next three years. We continue to expect USIS to deliver growth for the full year at the lower end of the long term range of 5% to 7%. This is the range that we got into for USIS back in February. EBITDA margins are expected to be above 50% for the year, which is slightly better and what we're expecting when we gave you guidance during our first quarter earnings call. On the International, International delivered outstanding 13% local currency organic revenue growth as well above the upper end of their long term range growth model we've talked about which is 8% to 10%. This is driven by broad-based organic initiatives. Total local currency revenue growth of 62% reflects this strong organic growth and the full quarter of revenues from Veda. Organic revenue growth in International's four largest verticals which are financial institutions, telcos, government and auto accelerated to 18% growth in the quarter, up from 13% growth in the first quarter versus first quarter of the year ago. International decisioning platforms, analytical services and debt management services revenue grew a solid 25% in the quarter, up from 19% in the first quarter. Again, accelerating growth sequentially. Our focus on building powerful insights continues to open new opportunities for customers who operate their businesses more efficiently and effectively. In the UK, our customer management solutions including loyal customer have enhanced our competitive position and enabled us to continue winning share within the financial institutions. Our UK government contract through TDX is performing well and in-line with our expectations. Initial collections results and anticipated list are consistent with our original expectations and relationships with the departments in the cabinet office remain very strong. We have also made proposals to other government agencies within the UK who are not included in the initial launch. It's still early, we do not expect Brexit to have any material impact on TDX or the UK government initiative. On Canada, Canada has made great progress in extending our trending data capabilities into the markets and the customers' interest with both large banks and financial institutions has been very strong. Also in Canada, I think we've alluded to this a bit last call, we have recently landed a multi-year, multi-million dollar bill to provide the TDX analytic solutions to one of our largest customers in Canada and that relationship started billing over this month. We're excited about the opportunities in Australia to deliver solid long-term growth for the region. The integration really is going very, very well. Today, there have not been any surprises. In the teams in both Australia and New Zealand are embracing the integration initiatives at all levels of those respective organizations. During the second quarter we began implementation of our global platforms in Australia. Those including fraud management, analytics, which are Cambrian and the cloud technology. These are very important strategic platforms which we have been investing in for many years, these are the best in class platforms and will provide Veda and our teams down there with tremendous capabilities to develop new products for their markets and customers for years to come. We've also identified a number of opportunities with Veda to both import and export new product ideas from that part of the world to other parts of the world and vice versa. Finally, the financial performance to date has met all of our expectations and is on track to meet our full-year expectations. International as a whole will have a very strong year of 2016. We expect organic constant currency revenue growth would be above the upper end of the long-term model with the range of 8% to 10% and total growth of 2016 to be over 40% including Veda. EBITDA margins should exit the year comfortably above the second quarter level, which is up nicely as you know versus second quarter of a year ago. On the Workforce Solutions, they had another outstanding performance in the quarter with 21% revenue growth and a 480 basis point expansion in their EBITDA margin. We continue to add records to the work number database and create valuable insights for our customers. Our success in penetrating key verticals led to strong double-digit growth in auto, consumer finance, government, mortgage, pre-employment and cards. Well, there's more healthcare vertical which is comprised of our income employment verification for CMS and ACA analytics for employers grew almost 200% in the quarter and continues to look very promising moving forward. Within our compliant center solutions, we've also developed a new series to help employers with the appeal management process under the affordable care. Employers can avoid penalties if they can prove to CMS that their employees were offered conforming affordable care covers for those employees who applied and were approved for subsidies covered through the ACA exchange. During the quarter we also announced the acquisition of Barnet Associates within EWS. This company we've known for a long time is a company with over 33 years of experience and is a nice tuck-in acquisition for EWS. We expect this acquisition to close during the current quarter. Workforce Solutions in summary will have another outstanding year of 2016 with winning growth substantially above their long-term range of 9% to 11% and adjusted EBITDA margins now in the high 40% range \u2013 just an outstanding stream of growth these guys have been on. Onto what we're used to call, we now call Global Consumer Solutions and delivering 22% local currency revenue growth driven largely by our indirect reseller customers and also that's solid adjusted EBITDA margins for the quarter. Indirect in resell revenue was up over 70%, primarily driven by our relationships, the Credit Karma and LifeLock. Our direct-to-consumer activities continue to deliver revenue and margin consistent with our expectations and Global Consumer Solutions will easily seed the long-term growth target, comfortably delivering strong double-digit growth for the year. The adjusted EBITDA margin for the year that we expected to exceed 30% and when John goes into his discussion, he'll talk about margin in GCS in the second quarter and put some color and texture on that for you. Back now to the corporate growth initiatives that you've grown familiar with. First is EGI and Enterprise Growth Initiatives which you know we've been out for about seven years now. They're fundamental growth driver to our multi-year growth levels. This year we had eight initiatives in EGI with very specific metrics and milestones with the management team reviews at least on a monthly basis. After six months, we're projecting the full-year revenue from these eight very important growth initiatives and now coming in over 33% above the target we have set at the beginning of the year. That team continues to execute at a very high level. Cambrian, you've heard us talk about that. It's truly having an amazing impact on how both we and our customers think about the effectiveness of our respective decisioning activities. Our customers were developing tools that enable them to increase approval rates, maintaining overall portfolio loss rates and incorporating more data than just the credit data, we can expand the universe with applicants on which they can render decisions with confidence \u2013 both of which improve marketing effectiveness and contribute incrementally to the revenue growth with very modest increase in expenses for our customers. Internally for Equifax, we use Cambrian to help us better understand the depth and quality with data assets. With these insights, we can identify opportunities to broaden and enhance our data assets as well as specific steps to further improve the quality of our data. On the NPI, New Product Innovation, is also making strong contributions and once again to our revenue growth. Through June, revenue from these initiatives is running 10% ahead of our expectations for 2016. You might recall that our expectations for third year revenue from our 2016 new product launches was already 130% greater than the 2015 launches third year revenue expectations. So we're ahead coming to the year with very high expectations for the class of products in 2016 and it's already running at least 10% ahead of those expectations. International Workforce Solutions and USIS are all exceeding expectations with the majority of the USIS growth coming from non-mortgage solutions when you think of new products. The pipeline is healthy and we have a number of launches scheduled for the second half of the year and expect to support that as for revenue growth in 2017 and beyond. Our outlook for the mortgage market in the US has changed given the recent trends in the yield on 10-year notes and the resulting strength in the activity. Previously we expected mortgage originations for 2016 to be flat despite in down our current view, the mortgage originations will be in the range of now flat to up mid-single digits for the full year and that 10-year treasury stay in the general range that they are now. Obviously if they get weaker, they give us some tailwind. If they rise at fast rate and anticipate it, it might create some headwind at the back end of the year. Over the years, our annual growth playbook processes has evolved to ensure we maintain an intense-focus on the most critical opportunities that drive revenue growth. This year, we've completed \u2013 it's hard to believe \u2013 our 11th growth in playbook with a focus on individual enterprise-wide, vertical market growth playbooks, develop much deeper insights into our opportunities across all the business units. With these new playbooks, we can better leverage our resources, customer relationships and opportunities to capture incremental revenue growth going forward. In summary \u2013 before I turn it over to John here \u2013 our strategic initiatives are at or ahead expected as we entered the year. My optimism for both 2016 and 2017 continues to improve as the year unfolds. One comment I want to make and spend a minute on before I give it to John is to put our USIS growth in perspective. A number of you have written about that, you're early reading last night, how we think about that. We view our enterprise-wide vertical market distribution efforts \u2013 you've heard us talk about that \u2013 for a number of years now in the U.S. as is vital to our differentiation and our success in the U.S. marketplace. These vertical markets cut across our U.S. business units, so it's not just credit. A good way to think about health of our U.S. credit business is to combine as we do, our USIS business with our verification services business and as you know reside in EWS and our healthcare revenues also residing in the EWS. When you think about that enterprise, what products are bringing to the US market, our revenue for the quarter actually grew a very solid 10%, well above the overall growth in our economy and is largely driven by due to product innovation, market penetration and insights. We can talk more about that during the Q&A. With that, I'll turn it over to John for detailed financials. John Gamble : Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As before, I will generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis. As a reminder, following to Veda acquisition, we started focusing on adjusted EBITDA margin to more consistently present the operating performance of the segments and the company as a whole. The non-GAAP reconciliation attached to our earnings release provides a more-detailed description of what is included in adjusted EBITDA margin. Now let me turn to the business units financial performance for the second quarter. U.S. Information Solutions revenue was $308 million, up 3% when compared to the second quarter of 2015. Online information solutions revenue was $220 million, up 2% compared to the year ago period. Total mortgage-related revenue in USIS was up 13% in the quarter. The mortgage bankers application index accelerated late in the quarter, coincident with the drop in the 10-year treasury, ending the quarter of 20%. Revenue mix shifted significantly in the quarter with almost 60% of the USIS mortgage revenue coming through resellers where revenue grew 22%. Financial marketing services revenue was $53 million, up 7% when compared to the year ago quarter. Our commercial business continues to grow nicely up 10% in 2Q and year-to-date. Identity in fraud solutions also continue to grow strongly, up 20% in 2Q and 25% year-to-date. As you recall, in 4Q '15, we realigned our business units, moving revenue with customers that have only direct-to-consumer relationships with Equifax from USIS to global consumer. During this realignment, customers with broader relationships with Equifax including direct-to-consumer, principally other credit reporting agencies were retained by USIS. USIS revenue in 2Q '16 and first half '16 has been negatively impacted by declines in revenues from these retained direct-to-consumer customers by about 2 percentage points. The adjusted EBITDA margin for U.S. Information Solutions for 2Q '16 was a very strong 50.4% and up from the 50.1% we've had in the second quarter of 2015. Workforce Solutions revenue was $177 million for the quarter, up 21% when compared to the second quarter of 2015. Verification services revenue of $110 million, up 17% continuous to be driven by strong double-digit growth across mortgage, government, auto, pre-employment and card segments. Employer Services revenue of $67 million was up 29% from last year. Again, the traditional Employer Service businesses of unemployment claims, Watsi, I-9 validations and on-boarding reformed well with combined revenue growth consistent with our long term expectations of mid-single digits. Workforce Analytics which provides services to employers to ensure they are in compliance with the affordable care act grew several hundred percent in 2Q '16. Seasonally, the first half of the year was the highest revenue for Workforce Analytics. This is the period in which employers are required Form 1095-C to employees, a service that Equifax provides. Employer Services revenue in 3Q '16 is expected to grow double digits, but will not be as strong as first half '16, reflecting the seasonal nature of Workforce Analytics revenue. The Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margin was 50.2%, up from 45.4% in 2Q '15. Seasonally, Workforce Solutions have higher adjusted EBITDA margins in the first half, reflecting seasonality in both Watsi and Workforce Analytics. The adjusted EBITDA margin for Workforce Solutions in 3Q '16 are expected to be up strongly year-to-year, but down sequentially due to the seasonality. Revenue from USIS and Workforce Solutions or total U.S. B2B revenue was $485 million, representing organic growth exceeding 9%. International's revenue was $290 million, up over 50% on the reported basis and over 60% on a local currency basis. Constant currency organic revenue growth which excludes data revenue was nicely above our long-term range of 8% to 10%. By region, Europe's revenue was $67 million, up 12% in U.S. dollars and 18% local currency. Given the sharp decline in the British pound following the Brexit vote, we anticipate that 3Q '16 Europe revenue measured in U.S. dollars would be negatively impacted by FX by approximately 10%. Latin America's revenue was $47 million, down 8% in US dollars, but up 14% local currency. The depreciation of the urgency in peso that occurred in Q4 last year represented almost 75% of the FX impact in Latin America. Asia Pacific revenue was $72 million, which is comprised mostly of revenue from Veda. Canada revenue was $32 million, flat in U.S. dollars, but up 5% in local currency. This was nice growth for Canada and reflects the renewed focus on NPI in Canada we referenced last quarter. For the second quarter, Internationals adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.4%, up nicely from 25.9% in 2Q '15. We saw a nice growth in the adjusted EBITDA margins in Canada and Europe, as well as benefiting from a full quarter's EBITDA contribution from Veda and Asia Pacific. Global Consumers Solutions revenue was $107 million, up 21% on a reported basis and 22% on a local currency basis. Growth was driven by our direct-to-consumer reseller customers. For the second quarter, the adjusted EBITDA margin was 26.4%, down from 30.6% in 2Q '15. During the second quarter, we had program-related revenue and startup expenses associated with the launching of a relationship with a new customer. Both the program revenue and the startup expenses will not continue into 3Q. As a result, revenue growth in 3Q is still expected to be double digit, but will be below the level generated in 2Q. Also as a result, adjusted EBITDA margin will improve significantly in the third quarter and for the remainder of the year. In the second quarter, general corporate expense was $46 million. Excluding Veda integration expense, 2Q '16 general corporate expense was $44 million. 2Q '16 was down from 1Q '16 as in the first quarter, executive equity comp is issued with the bulk of the expense in the period. 2Q '16 corporate expense was lower than expected as total employee bonuses accrued in the period were as expected, but more of the bonuses were incurred in the business units than in corporate. Also, some corporate investments expected to be incurred in 2Q '16 were delayed. For the third and fourth quarters, we expect general corporate expense to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million, reflecting higher levels of corporate investments. The adjusted EBITDA margin for Equifax was 36.6%, up from 35% in 2015. The strength in adjusted EBITDA margins in 2Q '16 reflect the very strong adjusted EBITDA margins and Workforce Solutions, International and USIS as well as lower corporate expenses. We expect the 3Q '16 EBITDA margin to decrease sequentially, but increase year-to-year at a rate slightly lower than our expectations for full-year improvement. We expect our full year 2016 EBITDA margin to be up about 75 basis points from the 34.7% we achieved in 2015. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 34%, which was slightly above our expectations due to unfavorable discreet items. Our expectation is that the full-year 2016 effective tax rate will be just under 33%, consistent with our guidance at the beginning of the year. In the third quarter, the effective tax rate will be below the full year rate. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $43 million and year-to-date are $83 million. Capital expenditures for the year are expected to be at approximately 6% of revenue, which is at the high-end of our long-term range reflecting investments made related to Veda integration. Year-to-date, operating cash flow remains strong at $280 million and consistent with our expectations. The slight decline from first half '15 is principally due to changes of working capital. Total debt in the quarter was $2.95 billion. During the quarter, we issued $775 million of five and 10-year notes that refinanced the 364-day credit facility used to finance the acquisition of Veda. As we indicated last quarter, we have suspended our share repurchase program and we will focus on debt reduction until we return credit metrics to a level consistent with our current credit ratings. We are continuing with the acquisitions and in the quarter announced the acquisition of Barnet Associates as Rick referenced earlier. With regards to the Veda acquisition, integration continues to go well and we continues to expect 2016 revenue from Veda to be $230 million to $235 million, with adjusted EPS accretion from Veda at approximately $0.20 share. Now, let me turn it back to Rick. Rick Smith : Thanks, John. Quick summary before we go to Q&A. The guidance looking forward to the third quarter, we're increasing our outlook for both revenue and adjusted EPS. We now expect revenue to be between $795 million and $805 million, reflecting constant currency revenue growth between 22% and 24%. This partially offset by 3 points of FX headwind. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.33 and $1.36 for the quarter which is up 17% to 19%. Excluding $0.03 per share negative impact from FX, this reflects constant currency EPS growth for the third quarter of 19% to 22%. With our strong second quarter performance and our strong outlook for the third quarter, we're also increasing our full-year outlook. For the full year, we expect revenue to now be between $3.13 billion and $3.16 billion, reflecting constant currency revenue growth of 20% to 22%, partially offset again by 3 points of FX headwind. This is an improvement from the previous guidance we provided you, which was $3.05 billion to $3.15 billion and increases our confidence we will end the year nicely above the high end of a multi-year model of 6% to 8% of organic revenue growth. From a revenue perspective, 2016, I think you'd agree, they're shifting up nicely. Constant currency, organic revenue growth, 11% in the first quarter accelerated to 12% in the second quarter and we're holding in the range of 11% to 13% in the second half that gives two years of double-digit constant currency organic revenue growth. This will also -- as you might guess -- give us good momentum as we go into 2017. Adjusted EPS for the year is expected to be now between $5.35 and $5.40, which is up 19% to 20% excluding approximately $0.12 per share for the full-year of negative impact from the FX. This reflects constant currency EPS growth for the year of 22% to 23%. This, too is up from the $5.15 to $5.25 we got to during our first quarter earnings call and as John alluded to, we now expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to expand by 75 basis points as we did got into earlier for the full year of 2016. With that, operator, we'd like to open up the questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] And we will take our first question from David Togut of Evercore ISI. David Togut : Thank you. Congrats on the second quarter outperformance and the lift in the 2016 outlook. Rick Smith : Thank you. David Togut : Rick, I was glad to hear the upgrade in your outlook for the mortgage market this year. I'm wondering more broadly, are the lower interest rates we're seeing in the U.S. and globally driving an increase in consumer credit demand more broadly as well? For example auto, mortgage and other key drivers? Rick Smith : Yes. We're seeing good strength in the U.S. in auto, in car and in mortgage and obviously beyond that, which is not really influenced by interest rates. Great strength in the debt management and analytics platform. We're talking about TDX, we got a nice win in Canada that we just announced. Broadly speaking, the interest rate environment in the U.S., I think is healthy for the U.S. consumer. We're not seeing dramatic changes quarter-to-quarter, David, but just good strength. David Togut : Got it. And then sorry if I missed it, but did you call out the number of active work number records as of the end of Q2? And as a related question, what are you seeing trend-wise in terms of hit ratio and Workforce Solutions? Rick Smith : Two great questions. I did not call it out. We are well on the path we can do to get to a number of 300 million total records. We focus on total records, there are so much value in historical, not just the active with that and with other things that we're used doing -- the hit rate across EWS on the work number continues to rise really solid. David Togut : Understood. And then just a quick final question, it was great to see the 480 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion in Workforce Solutions. How much operating leverage is left in this business over the next two to three years and what do you see as the ceiling on margins? Rick Smith : We've kind of guided long-term model EWS from the 50% range, below 50s and I think we'll get there. It is remarkable, David, and you've done, too during analysis. When you look at the rate of increase in the EBITDA margins over the past five years, it's a beauty that not only incremental margins are high. Yes, we expect that being the low 50% range moving forward which is extremely healthy. David Togut : As just finally, as Workforce Solutions becomes a bigger part of Equifax's total profit pool, how do you think about capital allocation across the businesses over time? Rick Smith : We continue to invest heavily, we head along with forcing it because we've remodeled and have the ability to investment significantly in growth businesses. We have invested heavily in EWS over the year's corp structure products, new products, new platforms and will continue to do so. When I think about a long-term horizon data, all EWS in the next horizon for them which we're working upon now, is taking it to global markets, taking our exchange technology platforms or products that requires capital investment so we have the wherewithal, the ability to invest in those countries to create the vision we have for EWS, which is a truly global enterprise over the next 10 years. David Togut : Understood. Thank you very much. Rick Smith : Thank you. Operator : And we'll move next to Manav Patnaik of Barclays. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is actually Greg calling out for Manav. Just wanted to ask about USIS and the bridge to the low end of 5% to 7% for the full year. I think it was about 3% in the first half. So, just wondering what's driving the acceleration? I think you've got mortgage and the Fanny Mae contract, but any other things we should be thinking about? Rick Smith : There are two things and Jeff, John, you jump in if you want to this. It's the point that John had made and it's the third time, I think is important before I get to the acceleration if I may. I wanted to be thinking of 3% or 3.-something. Just 3.-something the first quarter and 3.-something the second quarter. As John alluded to, we made a restructuring of our peso business, peso business, now called GCS in the last year, firstly this year. We left behind some traditional relationships that do the same thing \u2013 sell these products, but not to Credit Karma and LifeLock. We left that behind with USIS, took them easily and moved that whole thing over to the peso. The [indiscernible] behind is a shrinking business as you know and with that came about 2 points of headwind. Think about the health of the core USIS business, it actually grew with tough comps year-on-year because of mortgage last year actually grew when you adjust that direct-to-consumer business over 5% baseline. Now when you think of the acceleration going into second half of the year, it's really NPI and part of the NPI you alluded to was quite a data for Fannie Mae. But it's NPI generically. The total also then aided by the trended data for Fannie Mae. John Gamble : And very good continued performance expected in marketing services, in commercial, in identity in frauds. Those businesses that are growing very well are expected to continue to accelerate, drives the whole thing up. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, helpful. And then the other one for me would be on M&A, maybe a little detail on how Barnet Associates fits in with EWS and then more broadly, how the pipeline that we should expect further deals in the back half of the year? Thanks. Rick Smith : Thank you, Greg. Yes. Barnet, we've known for a long, long time. It might be 20 years plus and in his time, when he ran the business, Greg, and even before him Bill Canfield, established really good relationships with the owners of the company over the last four or five years and we're just getting to know them well. That's our philosophy we're close to doing deals, is to get to know the cultures of products opportunities. We've done that here. It's a small deal, but it's a nice deal. There are many EWS. They do everything. There's the synergies for us there and I think as I said, by time is we should close that in August. As far as the pipeline, it continues to be healthy and we did not include any other acquisitions in the guidance that we provided you. We continue to be very thoughtful, obviously driven by the strategy as to what we'll acquire, but we have the capacity, and the pipeline, and the ability to do more acquisitions this year if it makes sense. Operator : Otto Garrett of Deutsche Bank have our next question. Otto Garrett : Congrats on the strong quarter and increased guidance. Just one more question on auto and market. I know you guys called out some very strong results there, but just given the fact that we're seeing declining auto sales, or the seller, not a sale, I should say this year. Just go through and say how dependent is that business on the strong auto sales volume and how you're able to get some strong growth despite those trends? Rick Smith : One, obviously a growing market helps all and we are benefactor if the market itself is gone. Having said that, our forecast calls \u2013 and I don't know the exact numbers \u2013 but largely calls over the next X number of years, a moderation in growth in new and used car sales and we're talking in the U.S. So we don't expect the dramatic uptake from the market than we've seen post global recession to-date. Having said that, we are relatively under penetrated in auto. Number two, we have gotten great new products and we have been launching that help us penetrate the auto market. Within the penetration, a long [ph] we left still is the use of our award-number records to validate, verify and plug the net income. So that will fuel automotive growth for a number of quarters or years to come. Otto Garrett : Great. And also looking at the global consumer solution, you mentioned that you're getting some strong growth in your indirect channels in that. Can you just give us your comments or thoughts on some of the long-term agreements that some of your competitors are in that space or some of the transactions that have happened in that space? Thanks. Rick Smith : Sure. When we think of partners out there \u2013 I'll come back to that -- very, very nice and important good part of those that we had is a business called TrustedID who have got a variety of partners. You heard us talking about over the years and those continue to grow nicely. Specific to Credit Karma as you know, we had a contract with Credit Karma. That contract is far as the end of this year. This Karma practice with any good customer that we deal with. It's in both of our best interest to negotiate these contracts well before expiration. We have the teams doing that now. But beyond just that, we're looking really to enhance the partnership to add value to Credit Karma and that value would be through things like insights that we provide, the unique assets that we have and interest in partnering with them are what makes sense in countries around the world where we got very strong sizable platforms to help them expand their revenue streams beyond just the U.S. All of those are being intertwined as you might guess into the discussion of a contract negotiation and we remain very, very confident that the good resolution to the contract is Credit Karma. Otto Garrett : Okay. One last one. Just wondering if you have any updates on your contract with the Social Security Administration in terms of your fraud identity authentication revenue? Rick Smith : They're doing so well. It's still early. Otto Garrett : Great. Thank you. Rick Smith : Thanks. Operator : And we'll move next to Ramsey [ph] of Jefferies. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, guys. Great quarter. I wanted to ask you about the international margin expansion. They're very solid this quarter. Is this just a question of increasing operating leverages you scale in global markets? Are there other mix-related impacts? Are there other leverage you can work in order to get the margin going internationally? Rick Smith : I'll start and John, please jump in. It is consistent with the expectation when we gave you the multi-year guidance for margins for Internationals. First and foremost, no surprises at all. There are a couple of things I think about \u2013 John, you may have a couple more that I'd miss \u2013 that are coming together to aid that margin increase. Number one, you may recall sometime in 2015, we announced some restructuring, some recent innovation across the international marketplace. We did greater scale. That was an investment, we're now yielding some benefits. Number two, we talked about the government contract for debt management analytics in the UK who have investments in the cash in the revenue, you're now getting revenue. And number three is what our model is, just incremental margin. As you grow [ph], margin expands. Number four is as you know, we bought Veda. Veda had margins. We announced the acquisition and that were accreted for the international margins and now staying on focus. I think those four things are the vast majority. John, you know some? John Gamble : Those are the biggest areas and we're also globalizing platforms which allows you to reduce your cost more rapidly. Yes. Rick Smith : That's a great point. As we deployed these global platforms around the world, over the next X number of years, you should continue to see some margin enhancement from International. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, that makes sense. Did the small tuck-in Barnet, will that add an impact? Can you parse out the impact on the year in terms of revenue EPS? Rick Smith : It's small, Ramsay. It's nice for us. At the corporate level, it's very small this year because in August you'll have less than half a year of revenue. But we've got some great finance for percentages in growth as we take that asset under our wings for 2017 and beyond. Unidentified Analyst : All right, terrific. Thanks a lot, guys. Rick Smith : Sure. Operator : And Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley has our next question. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. This is Patrick in for Toni. I wanted to ask about global consumer growth because obviously, very robust this quarter, but remains well above 5% to 8% multi-organic growth framework you've talked about in the past. Do you have any sense of that market for providing consumers with credit scores on personal finance websites, credit card statements, et cetera? Is it becoming increasingly saturated? Rick Smith : It will become saturated at some point in time. We don't see any signs and we'll start the U.S. first. There isn't any signs that there's a saturation of that marketplace yet in the U.S. and having said that, you also know that we directly and indirectly \u2013 who partners [ph] questions is taken that capability to other markets around the world. Our global consumer in GCS business is truly global. So if there's a need and opportunity for us, we and our partners will directly build those pricing capabilities in other parts of the world, we're going to do so. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks. And then I wanted to ask about potential investments in alternative data. I know you're getting data from telecom and utility companies now. But I wanted to ask about that from an M&A and then OpEx perspective going forward? Rick Smith : We have under Ray Lockers [ph] leadership we have got Annie [ph] who runs data analytics in marketing for us, have a data team. They are very capable team and their team is coming back to our strategy. As you might guessed, Patrick, if you look at each country around the world, as you look at every vertical around the world, there's a strategy that says where are we playing our data capabilities? Where are the gaps in data capabilities? What is the process to fill those gaps? Is it to partner or is it to buy? That's a continual focus we have. That granular level of detail around the world. Unidentified Analyst : Great. And then lastly I do want to ask about growth in peer-to-peer lending in marketplaces over the last number of years and it's sort of a longer term question. But do you anticipate any impact from that trend, disintermediation on the USIS business over the long term? Rick Smith : I do not. I think obviously the marketplace is adjusting a bit. You can see challenges ahead of as you know. They're customers of ours, they buy our credit data as you know, they buy our employment data, they buy our income data, they buy some fraud data. They're good customers of ours. I don't know, but if I'd make a guess, I think in the future, if you think about that remote on secured lending, which you call peer-to-peer lending, it would surprise me if those become really part of banking capabilities as opposed individual entities. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thanks, Rick. Congratulations on the quarter, everyone. Rick Smith : Thank you. Operator : And we'll move next to Tim McHugh of William Blair & Company. Tim McHugh : Yes, thanks. Can I ask if you can help size, I guess what part of USIS at this point that said direct-to-consumer piece though that's declining and is that a business meant longer term decline? Should we just try and think about how much of a medium-term drag we should think about that being on the piece of the business? Rick Smith : Yes, Tim, maybe. Back some time in 2015, I can't recall, John, we've talked about what the world might look like direct-to-consumer business and we said that that business would be the low-growth, lowest single digit growth, maybe even decline. But the other partners and some so forth are trustworthy business. So within USIS, to be very specific, John, to find that for, if you take the USIS business, that PPC revenue created 2 points of headwind for USIS in the first half of the year. You can reverse, do the math yourself. I don't have it up on my head. You can do that math -- how large the revenue decline rate on that basis [ph]. John Gamble : But it's not a large business for us. No. But it did decline materially in the quarter. Tim McHugh : Okay. And then for USIS, you didn't really change the revenue outlook, but you said you feel better about where margins lined up for this year. I guess what changed if you look at the piece? Rick Smith : Just clarification on the revenue outlook, we didn't change it which is prior to guidance. Sequentially, it's going to go from three point something until a total year up, about 5% growth. So you have much higher growth in the second half of the year over the USIS and with that comes obviously margins, incremental margin in the USIS is significant. Growth acceleration in margin grows with it. Tim McHugh : Okay, but your full-year guidance, I guess wasn't any different than before, what you said your full-year margin guidance was different? Rick Smith : We said slightly higher. Tim McHugh : Okay. All right. Thanks. Rick Smith : Sure. Operator : And we'll move next to Gary Bisbee of RBC Capital Markets. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, guys, good morning. This is Anthony [ph] for Gary. Congratulations on the quarter again and I guess just thinking longer term, I think you mentioned that 2016 NPI is running 10% above planned for June. Any insight that was driving that? It would be kind of greater market potential that you guys are seeing, or penetration, or new adjacent market that somebody's products came? Do you have any use by or what is driving that? Rick Smith : I think it's a couple of things, Kyle. I think you may recall \u2013 I can't remember what the heck it was now, but we launched this thing called Innovation 2.0 maybe late '14 and that was a catalyst. Just when you think about integration, we think about NPI, also focused on how we become better at executing and we launched products at the time, the revenue is better. It was a big focus as well. The other thing you can recall, we've launched this capability called Cambrian. There's a lot of this that build products in a fraction of time. It used to take us to build products, modify products to the customer's needs. The combination of Innovation 2.0, higher level execution which means build and launch, we actually get the word sooner and faster and then the third element is Cambrian. Those three, you're seeing an alteration of those three now result in greater confidence in our revenue outlook for NPI to the point that it was just not NPI [ph], but was the growth coming out of our enterprise growth initiatives, which is substantially higher than one we thought and also the last year. Our team is actually very high-level as well. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thanks. I guess on a similar front, the International organic growth among some of the key verticals you pointed out accelerated pretty strong in there in the second quarter. I guess are there particular markets within those verticals, particular products that you guys are seeing particular strength or little more in there [ph]? Rick Smith : Kyle, the rewarding aspect is it is so broad-based. I think I mentioned a number of verticals International, but sequentially was stronger in the second quarter versus first quarter and if you broke that down like country by vertical, you see similar things. It's not that it's being driven by one vertical, one country should broad-based countries and verticals. That's largely due to the fact that the focus we launched a number of years ago to become experts in different verticals that were important to our long-term growth, but the resources the data assets, the technology platforms, the analytics focus on those verticals to drive growth and we're seeing as it continued benefit of that focus. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thanks. Rick Smith : Sure. Operator : And Jeff Mueler of Baird have our next question. Jeff Mueler : Yes, thank you. Can you talk about the employer services, new product pipeline? Obviously WSA is red-hot right now, but can you just talk about the pipeline and anything about that product development process in terms of how it's maybe similar versus different to developing products in your other businesses given that I think there's more of a BPO element to a lot of the products? Rick Smith : How should I tackle that? I'd say the process are the same. NPI, it doesn't matter what you're doing, it's rigorous to process and we've been at it now for 10 years. That applied as much too. We are not developing a lot of products to be very explicit, any WSA, BPO products. You don't get that kind of margin enhances we're getting in EWS to 400 basis points, which we said was over 50% total EBITDA margin, those are SaaS products. We talk about in the last couple of calls, this contract of compliance center and it's really the products underneath compliance center that Dan has started building out, now Marie is building out. Think of those as SaaS products largely; I-9 would be an example, ACA would be an example and others. But the staff margin as you know is a great revenue model, highly recurring revenue margin. So think about that, no differently you think about the rest of the Equifax as we think about new products. John Gamble : The largest is users has substantial investment there to make. Rick Smith : John, you said it great. Thanks. A big, big piece of employer service is part of EWS as you probably know, Jeff, is in our employment claims business and the team is investing heavily in moving that to a SaaS product as well, which if you think of the next five or ten years in the margin enhancement, you're getting, converting a model on these business to more of a SaaS product, that's huge margin. Jeff Mueler : Okay. And then super scores. How big of a business is that for you today? Are we at the early stages of it? Rick Smith : In the scheme of things, if you think of a major growth leverage we have in the genre, primarily is day-in day-out, super scores is not one of them. Jeff Mueler : Okay and then just finally I guess specific to Credit Karma, is it reasonable to assume that since you were the second in terms of order, time, data, provider to that relationship, that maybe you came in at a lower price, so as price gets reset every through your competitor that you would theoretically have lots to lose in terms of potential pricing adjustment? Rick Smith : Jeff in particular time, but know this -- and I think you know this well enough now, our philosophy, we think about the relationships. Probably if you continue to add, you unique value and insights that make their business better, that make their revenue stronger, that make their profit stronger \u2013 if we could do things about leveraging capabilities that we have that are unique to us about the employment data, the income data, some fraud data, Cambrian, I think I've mentioned in my comments earlier, helping them get that we are in and we are very significant players is a way to make their business better, stronger \u2013 you wrap all those things together as we've done over the years, you tend to move away from price discussion or the value discussion. But they are very, very good customers. I'd say even more than customer, a partner of ours and the attitude is along the lines that you just describe and that's value creation for both sides. Jeff Mueler : Good. Thank you. Great quarter. Rick Smith : Thank you. Operator : And we'll move to Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan. Andrew Steinerman : Hi, Rick. I know Equifax has many current strong growth drivers. I do want to ask more about the trended credit data specifically the Fannie Mae initiative and how much that might add to Equifax revenues by fourth quarter of this year? Our team calculated about 1.2% for that, thinking about the price increases that only go to Fannie Mae loans, but maybe that's too low. Could I think, I understand now, that the trended data price increases are also going to do it to Freddie loans as well? Rick Smith : I'm going to start the latter piece and I'll come to the first piece. What you're saying at current with the support of Fannie Mae making this standard for all loans securitize through them, they turned, we're saying merging is the only product being offered to the marketplace going forward. The mortgage will be a product that has data that has been trended. Freddie does not have the technical capabilities yet to consume, they turn the data. It's our understanding, they're highly interested in doing so, but being very clear, the product we're going to offer to the mortgage market in the U.S. is trended product only. That comes at a different price point than in the past when it started. You're pretty smart, you got ways to think about that, look at your number. I'm not going to disclose that here. Andrew Steinerman : Right. I understand the reason that price increased, but you do admit that when you add it all up, it's over a point of additional revenue for Equifax. Right? Rick Smith : You're good, Andrew. Yes, it will go to all of the resellers and our direct customers as well. We just not here to disclose. You know this, you've been a witness a long time. Wherever we could add value to a customer \u2013 in this case the mortgage market, make underlying decisions better and we can add value from our product, in this case trended and charge more for that. We've done that for years. We're always about trying to create value to our customers and I think trended data, we know for a fact as mortgages, we had investments and resources behind that, there's also the higher price. That's no different than what we've been doing for 10 years. It just happened to be a little different product because there's a trended element to it, but we're not going to disclose that percentage. Andrew Steinerman : All right. Thanks for the try. I appreciate it. Rick Smith : Thank you, Andrew. Operator : And Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel has our next question. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, good morning. Thank you for squeezing me in here. Rick Smith : Sure. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Rick, could you remind us where we are in terms of getting ACA clients to contribute more of the employment records to the work number database? You mentioned in the past that for the start, defaulting there, are that just happening in their contracts and are you actively working on migrating that? Rick Smith : Great question, Shlomo. I think we've talked about this generically before its ready and maybe a quarter or so ago. Think about what had to be done and number one was a technology-built that enabled a client when they signed up for ACA to seamlessly forward the data from the ACA database, into the work number database. That work was launched earlier this year and I believe went live in June, July. Guys, am I that right? June or July? Okay. So June or July, it is now out and warming today. If you check on the slides, one will think about is two buckets of customers. There are customers who have already been clients of ACA and there are new guys who will sign up for ACA. The new ones are easy. You sign them up, it ports over to the work number database. The team and I are going back to those times who have previously been customers of ACA and working with them. Now they're porting their data from ACA into the work number. Yes, we're adding records and have been adding records for at least a month or so to the work number database out of ACA. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. Are the customers amenable to that? In other words, the old customers, the relatively old customers there amenable to going back and actively putting it on this platform? Rick Smith : Yes. There's almost virtually no work required from them as well. Existing customers will be clients of ACA in the last years, yes are amenable to becoming to contributors to work number database. That's a process we put them through to make sure they're clearly aware of that population of the work number database. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay, thanks. And then John, in terms of second half free cash flows, we see some of those working capital items like really reversed? To have a pretty strong second half, or is there something going on that is going to make this just somewhat of a lower free cash flow year in general? John Gamble : The working capital items that affected the first half are really specific in the first half. So you should see better working capital performance in the second half. CapEx is up this year, so you're going to see that impact year-on-year, but in terms of operating cash flow before free cash flow, the working capital items should reverse. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. And then I hate to beat this horse again, but can you just give us an on-the-ground description of the part of the business that was retained in USIS that is shrinking? Are other euros are selling your scores, or you're selling their scores? I'm just trying to understand exactly what it is that's shrinking over there. Rick Smith : Yes. John have described it fairly well, you just hit it on the head and that is other players in marketplace and we've got extensive relationships with including PPC, so the other bureaus as you call have them and are buying those products they sell in the PPC marketplace. Because of the free marketplace, it's growing their business. The bureau's business is shrinking. When that shrinks, the USIS revenue shrinks. Okay? Thanks. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Yes, it does, but your own direct-to-consumer, is that business that we stable? Rick Smith : Repeat? Shlomo Rosenbaum : Yes. Where you guys have your own subscription-based business that I go up there on Equifax.com and sign myself up per month or something like that? Rick Smith : It's flat. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Flat? Okay. All right, very good. Thank you. Rick Smith : Thank you, Shlomo. Operator : And Oscar Turner of SunTrust have our next question. Oscar Turner : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Rick Smith : Sure. Oscar Turner : So you talked about the importance of your enterprise-wide vertical focus distribution strategy. Which verticals do you view as having the most wide space? Maybe both in the U.S. and then also international, and then also would it make sense to start reporting your business based on verticals? Rick Smith : I'll answer that last piece first and I'll go to the first piece. I'm a firm believer by verticals. They just have [indiscernible]. We have verticals focuses across the globe however which gives the domain expertise and the ability to invest specifically on products and technology and most of them \u2013 I don't see a time, Oscar, in the near future where that means or several years where you report at a vertical. That does not mean we're not running full speed around verticals. Having said that, we'll remain verticals as John -- that I think about the next five years, global will add a lot of excitement and energy for long-term growth. Obviously fraud prevention and identity management would be one. The government is another around the world. There are some really cool things in U.S. as you know, around government. The debt management platform in UK is government, so government is going to be a continued big growth there. Of course healthcare is I think when you talk about growing almost 200% in the second quarter would be another one. There's the traditional ones you always think about us, you under-penetrated auto, but growing nicely. Financial services are all of the important... John Gamble : Commercials and opportunities. Rick Smith : Commercials and opportunity. We've talked about, Oscar, with the early days, if your horizons are like ours, which is five to ten years, was like bringing our exchange capability and product capability from EWS on the world and opening up a whole new realm of growth opportunities there would be another. Oscar Turner : Okay, thanks. That's helpful. And then you mentioned government being a focus, but just looking at the UK government bill, can you provide more color on the status of that deal? What's the volume in the database and also how should we think about the timing of the revenue growth ramp? Rick Smith : Revenue is coming through nicely. It's high expectations and relationships are fabulous. They give us \u2013 you know hard to believe with pounds and they give us something about \u00a31 billion of debt. We've now analyzed and replaced things. At the expected level when we launched this thing, almost under any dimension you can think of for the management and complicated frauds like the UK debt management analytics platform, it's at or ahead our expectations. It's really going well. And as we talked about before, I hope they give us credibility, it's starting to yield right now in the other arms of the UK government to help build more revenue streams than we have today and take that product capability, once it's a certain point and bringing other countries as well and help other governments on the world solve the same problem. Oscar Turner : Okay, thank you. Rick Smith : Thank you. Operator : And we will take our final question from Brett Huff of Stephens Inc. Brett Huff : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Rick Smith : Sure, Brett. Brett Huff : Just one sort of housekeeping thing and then one general question. On the housekeeping side, I don't want to beat the Barnet thing to death, but your guidance raise was substantially above your 2Q beat and I just want to make sure how much of that guidance raise was sort of fundamental or organic and how much of it was from Barnet? I know you said it was small. I just want to make sure I understand that magnitude. Rick Smith : Good question. Thank you for the clarification. Zero is associated to the Barnet acquisition. Brett Huff : Okay, that's helpful. And then in mortgage, I recall when mortgage is good and you're selling a lot of 3-in-1s, that's a low-margin business. Did you see negative impact from that in the quarter on the percentage margin? John Gamble : What we saw on the quarter actually is a shift in our mortgage business for resellers, which is much higher margins. It's less revenue generation, but the margin is substantially higher. Rick Smith : Just one point of clarification that -- just try towards lower, it's still exceptional margin at the end of the business. Brett Huff : Okay. That's all I needed. Thank you. Rick Smith : Thank you, Brett. Rick Smith : Okay. I'd like to thank everybody for their time and interest. And with that, operator we'll terminate the call. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you everyone for your participation.",

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Dodge. Please go ahead, sir. Jeff Dodge : Thanks and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Jeff Dodge, Investor Relations. And with me today are Rick Smith, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today at www.equifax.com in the Investor Relations section under the About Equifax tab. During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our businesses are set forth in our filings with the SEC including the 2015 Form 10-K and all subsequent filings. During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA margin, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance. For the third quarter of 2016, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes acquisition related amortization expense, as well as the transaction and integration expenses associated with our acquisition of Veda. Adjusted EBITDA margin in defined as net income attributable to Equifax adding back income tax expense, interest expense net of interest income, depreciation, amortization and the impact of certain one-time items, including the transaction and integration expenses associated with our acquisition of Veda. These non-GAAP financial measures are detailed in the reconciliation tables which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our website. Also, please refer to our investor presentations which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website for further details. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Rick. Richard Smith : Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Thanks as always for joining us. I start up with some high my level observations for the quarter for the corporation, dig in some details of business unit level. John will go through the financial details and I will come back with some closing comments before questions. Third quarter was just another outstanding broad based performance by the team just really continuous to impress me. The growth we had in the third quarter accelerated on the first half of the year that added to our strong outperformance year-to-date. Our four business units continue to execute at a very high level, driving impressive expansion in our revenue, our adjusted EBITDA margins and the bottom line results. For the quarter, total revenue was $804 million, up 20% on reported basis and up 23% on local currency basis from the third quarter of last year. Organic constant currency revenue growth accelerated from the first half coming in strongly at 13% up over last year. In the quarter, FX created a $19 year-over-year headwind. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.9% compared to 34.6% in the third quarter of 2015 representing a very solid year-on-year increase and well above our annual 25 basis point target increase and well above our 75 basis point expectation we have for the full year of 2016. Adjusted EPS was $1.44 of 26% for $1.14 in the third quarter last year and better than our expectations when we gave third quarter guidance back in July of this year. So let me jump into the individual BUs as always, I\u2019ll start with USIS, they had delivered a solid 9% revenue growth, significant acceleration from the first half, driven by broad based new product revenue including trended data. We can talk more about trended data in a second and we\u2019ll get into in Q&A as well. Our tended data now is a reality. As expected Fannie Mae launched its desktop underwriter in late September. And as we indicated during our second quarter call, billing for credit data began in August for all mortgage related enquires. Revenue for the third quarter largely came in as we had expected. We have a very good relationship with Fannie Mae and initiated discussions on trended data within nearly three year ago, we continue to see opportunities to work with Fannie and transforming the mortgage space including the announcement just this week for the launched of Fannie\u2019s desktop underwriter validation services which incorporates verified consumer income and pilot information from workforce solutions. We believe that will be a nice catalyst for continued mortgage growth for EWS going forward. Additionally from our data and analytics team, they continue its efforts to complete a verity of analysis to access the lift from trended data for other decisioning activities. We\u2019ll talked to you about that in the past is really getting down the granular level by vertical by sub-vertical by day unique data asset understanding with the list. And trended data provide approximately 15% list in accessing prime accounts for open a home equity loan and a 20% lift in assessing prime accounts for default risk on home equity loans. With the advent of Cambrian which we\u2019re familiar with, we now have an analytical environment containing over 18 months or more of historical data across many of our unique data assets. Today Cambrian is a non-production environment providing unparalleled ability to deliver compelling customer insights. So today we are also building analytics and insights on trended data is 80 months or more including the credit file and other unique data assets in 2017 we\u2019re going to move to 24 months of trended data we have for the credit file to significantly beyond to 24 months in the production environment. I think outlook bring up a whole new room of opportunities to work with our customers and solve problems and we couldn\u2019t solve before. Sticking with USIS, on September 30, we reached a long term agreement with SBFE to become a certified vendor. We now will be able to combine our CFN commercial financial network data assets with SBFE data to deliver best-in-class solutions for small business information customers. USIS is expected to deliver revenue growth for the fourth quarter at the high end of the targeted range, which was communicated as 5% to 7%. And EBITDA margins will continue be above 50% in the fourth quarter and for the full year. International, they continue to make great progress on its most - on their most important strategic initiatives while delivering third quarter local currency revenue growth of 60%, and organic local currency revenue growth up 10%. In the quarterly, they reported adjusted EBITDA margins expendables by our 200 basis points from the year prior. The Veda integration continues to go well and remains on schedule. Some sub-hole underway, where we talked before our global platform deployment into Veda which includes close to Cambrian for Cloud platform are underway and especially be operational in mid-2017. The NPI process has been established with the local leadership team and will be incorporating the Veda NPI revenue into our vitality index beginning in 2017. We\u2019ve also identified a number of opportunities to exports some of Veda\u2019s products to other international geographies. Debt placement from the U.K. government is now up to 1.6 billion pounds and our performance year-to-date is exceeding the baseline performance we\u2019ve established. We now have all six founding agencies of the U.K. government boarded and have analytical projects underway with two additional agencies. For the initiative is still old in the early status, we\u2019re extremely pleased with both our relationship with U.K. agencies and the financial results we\u2019re delivering. Organic revenue in international\u2019s five largest verticals, FI, telcos, government, retail and auto and aggregate was up 13% for the quarter. International decisioning platforms, analytical services and debt management services revenue grew 19% in the quarter. These high value solutions continue to strengthen our relationships with customers and our market position. In the coming quarters, we will be installing more sophisticated technology platforms i.e. interconnect our wholesale platform and Cambrian throughout our international footprint to drive future revenue growth. Canada continued to grow very good momentum with trended data. In the third quarter, we launched Cambrian platform which will further enhance our competitive position with best-in-class solutions leveraging trended data. International is expected to deliver organic constant currency revenue growth in the fourth quarter and the full year above the upper end of its long term model of 8% to 10%. Reported revenue growth for 2016 is expected to approach 55%, adjusted EBITDA margins should increase sequentially and exit the year approaching 30%. Workforce Solutions they are strong momentum as resulted in another outstanding performance in the third quarter with 23% revenue growth and the 350 basis point expansion in the adjusted EBITDA margin. Total records in the work number database now approaches our short term goal of $300 million with over 6,600 different data contributors to that database. Our initiatives to further penetrate key verticals led a strong double digit growth in mortgage, auto, government and pre-employment enable few. Revenue from four Healthcare vertical comprised an income and employment verification for CMS and ACA analytics for employers grew over 240% in the quarter. In the quarter, Workforce Solutions completed the acquisition of Barnett/VJS, a small regional provider of employment and income verification and unemployment insurance services to further accelerate the growth of work number database. Early days that\u2019s going very well. As I indicated earlier this week, no more color from Fannie Mae, they\u2019ve announced the integration of our full suite of employment and income verification services into their desktop underwriting platform. Employment and income verification services includes data from the Workforce Solutions, the work number of database providing instant and waterfall employment and income verification services. With these services, unlike cycle times will be reduced and the lenders reliance on applicant providing W-2 pay steps or other income only documentation will be eliminated and this gives them protection should a mortgage now perform a protection of having the banks put the mortgages back to them. That\u2019s a great benefit for EWS. Workforce Solutions has had an outstanding year in 2016. Both organic and reported revenue growth are expected to exceed 15% in the fourth quarter and 20% for 2016 substantially above its long term range of 9% to 11%. Adjusted EBTIDA margins are expected to be nicely over 45% for the fourth quarter of 2016 and high 40s for the full year. Global Consumer Solutions continuously to make great progress on its strategic initiatives particularly building out a strong market position in both DTC reseller and indirect markets that include partnerships with the number of very successful companies that we\u2019ve talked about before such as Credit Karma, LifeLock, Harte-Hanks block and others. We\u2019re pleased to announce we have executed a new longer term partnership with Credit Karma. The new and expanded partnership is focused on growing both of our businesses by leveraging unique data assets, innovation and analytics, including the use of our Cambrian platform and expanding our partnerships beyond the borders of the U.S. This quarter, we deployed our new global consumer platform called [indiscernible] a best-in-class SaaS based ecommerce platform which provides much greater marketing flexibility to serve our partners. During the quarter, we successfully transition one of our largest customers to this new platform and by the end of 2017, we will deploy this platform across all portions of our U.S. business now will be well in our way to deploying across other geographies in which we operate. Global Consumer Solutions is expected to deliver fourth quarter and full year 2016 constant currency revenue growth exceeding 15% with fourth quarter and full year adjusted EBITDA margin at approximately 30%. Few high level points at the Corp level before John gets into the financial details, things we\u2019re talking about before those so important to our culture and our results. First is our enterprise growth initiatives which are our largest and most complex growth initiatives we have. They are performing very well in 2016 with revenue generation projected to be up over 35% from our expectations earlier this year and over three times the revenue generated from EGI in 2015. Our overall performance in new product innovations, initiatives in 2016 is also outstanding. The three year revenue from our 2016 launches is expected to be more than 170% above the expected three year revenue from our 2015 launches. This is the strongest NPI performance we had since it was built and created some ten years ago. Our vitality index that held last year and the pipeline of new products continues to be very robust. Today we launched approximately 40 new products and expect to launch another 20 products before year end. In summary, our strategic initiatives continue to perform well and are head of our expectations we have at the beginning of the year. With this continued focused on improving the process allows us to drive continues growth, I expect these initiatives will continue to drive and deliver incremental revenue growth in 2017 and beyond. So with that, John. John Gamble : Thanks Rick and good morning, everyone. As before, I will generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis. As a reminder, following to Veda acquisition, we started focusing on adjusted EBITDA margin to more consistently present the operating performance of the segments and the company as a whole. The non-GAAP reconciliation attached to our earnings release provides a more-detailed description of what is included in the adjusted EBITDA margin. Now let me turn to the business unit financial performance for the third quarter. U.S. Information Solutions revenue was $317 million, up 9% when compared to the third quarter of 2015. Online information solutions revenue was $230 million, up 7% when compared to the year ago period. Total mortgage-related revenue in USIS was up 39% in the quarter. The mortgage bankers\u2019 application index growth accelerated significantly up 35% in the third quarter compared to the 20% growth we saw in the second quarter. Given the much stronger mortgage market performance in 3Q 2016 and continued to accommodate interest rate environment, we now expect the mortgage market to grow solidly double digit in 2016. Financial marketing services revenue was $48 million, up 3% when compared to the year ago quarter. Our commercial products, we grew 8% in 3Q. We have made great progress building the Equifax commercial financial network which includes straight line data from banking and other financial institutions similar to the SBFE as well as communications and utilities, wholesale trade, printing, publishing chemicals and allay [ph] products and rental on leasing data. When combined with Equifax consumer credit data, we can now opera substantially differentiated data analytics to our U.S. commercial customers. Identity in fraud solutions also continue to grow strongly up 19% in 3Q and 23% year-to-date. USIS direct-to-consumer revenue principally our revenue with others CRAs was down over 20% in the quarter and largely in line with the first half. The adjusted EBITDA margin for U.S. Information Solutions in 3Q \u201816 was 50.6%, up from 49.9% in the third quarter of 2015. Workforce Solutions revenue was $171 million for the quarter, up 23% when compared to the third quarter of 2015. Verification services revenue of $115 million was also up 25% and continues to be driven by strong double-digit growth across mortgage, government, auto, pre-employment. Employer Services revenue of $57 million was up 23% from last year as well. Revenue growth from unemployment insurance, I-9, tax incentives and other retail services was consistent with the annual model of mid-single-digit growth. ACA analytics revenue was up substantially in the quarter versus 3Q \u201815 driving much of the growth. As we had indicated previously, ACA analytics revenue was down sequentially and from the first half run rate. As expected, given that the ACA business is seasonal with higher revenue in the first half of the year went 1095s are delivered to employee. The Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margin was 47%, up from 43.5% in 3Q \u201815 and in line with our expectations. Revenue from USIS and Workforce Solutions, our total U.S. B2B revenue was $489 million, representing organic growth of 13%. International\u2019s revenue was $214 million, up 47% on a reported basis and over 60% on a local currency basis when compared to 3Q \u201815. Organic constant currency revenue growth was approximately 10%. By region, Europe\u2019s revenue was $62 million, up 2% in U.S. dollars and 16% local currency. We have seen some moderate impact on local currency revenue following the Brexit vote with selected large U.K. financial institutions. Debt Management grew nicely in the quarter as our relationship with the U.K. government continues to perform as we had expected. The sharp depreciation of the British pound following the Brexit vote in late July significantly impacted U.S. dollar revenue growth in the region for the third quarter. The almost 7% decline in the British pound in early October will further impact 4Q \u201816 U.S. dollar revenue growth. Latin America\u2019s revenue was $47 million, down 9% in U.S. dollars, but up 9% in local currency. The over 60% depreciation of the Argentinean peso from late December 2015 through March 2016 has negatively impacted the U.S. dollar performance of our largest and most profitable country in the region. Asia Pacific revenue was $74 million, which is comprised mostly of revenue from Veda. Canada revenue was $32 million, up 4% in U.S. dollars and up 3% in local currency. Canada continues to perform in line with our expectations including substantial improvements in the new product innovation initiatives which include trended data. For the third quarter, International adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.4%, up nicely from 26.2% in 3Q \u201815. On a constant currency basis, margins expanded over 300 basis points versus 3Q \u201815 and almost 50 basis point sequentially. As Rick indicated, 4Q \u201816 adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to increase sequentially and approach 30% in 4Q \u201816. Global Consumer Solutions revenue was $101 million, up 12% on a reported basis and up 14% on a local currency basis. Growth again was driven by our direct-to-consumer reseller customers. For the third quarter, the adjusted EBITDA margin was 30% in line with our expectations. The adjusted EBITDA margin was down from 3.8% in 3Q \u201815 but up significantly from a 26.4% in 2Q \u201816 when we reporting LifeLock. In the third quarter, general corporate expense was $52 million consistent with our expectations. For the fourth quarter, total general corporate expense is expected to be slightly above $55 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.9%, up a 130 basis points from 34.6% in 2015. To strengthen adjusted EBITDA margins reflects year-over-year growth in USIS, Workforce Solutions and International. We expect the course 2016 adjusted EBITDA margins to be above Q3 adjusted EBITDA margin and our full year 2016, adjusted EBITDA margin to be up more than 100 basis points from the 34.7% we achieved in 2015. As Rick mentioned before, this is nicely above the target for 2016 of a 75 basis point expansion in our adjusted EBITDA margin. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter at 29.1% was below the anticipated level of 32.5%, which we communicated during our July earnings call. The lower effective tax rate reflects several discrete or onetime items which benefited our effective tax rate by over 3% points and our adjusted EPS by above $0.05 a share. Our current expectation is that Q4 tax rate will be approximately 32.5%. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $48 million and year-to-date are $131 million. We continue to expect capital expenditures for the year to be about 6% of revenue, which is at the high-end of our long-term range as investments are made related to our integration of Veda. Year-to-date, operating cash flow remained strong at $525 million. Total debt in the quarter was $2.8 billion. We continue to reduce our leverage following a Veda acquisition which is now down at 2.58 times. Our target is to reduce leverage back to approximately 2.25 times EBITDA, which we expect to occur in 2017. Now, let me turn it back to Rick. Richard Smith : Thanks, John. I trust you agree 2016 has been an outstanding year for the company, strong and consistent execution throughout the company has resulted in a broad base performance significantly see the expectations we had beginning of the year. We firmly believe this positions us well for growth in 2017. For fourth quarter currency exchange rates, we expect revenue to be between $797 million and $801 million reflecting constant currency revenue growth of just over 22%, partially offset by about 2% of FX headwind as reflects organic growth over 12%. Almost 7% depreciation in the U.K. pound in early October which charges John just referenced resulted in a majority of the incremental $6 million of FX headwind versus our expectations for the fourth quarter we gave guidance back in July. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between a $1.35 and a $1.38, which is up 18% to 21% for the fourth quarter excluding $0.03 per share of negative FX, which reflects constant currency adjusted EPS growth of 21% to 24%. With this out, look our second half organic constant currency growth is approximately 12% and in line with the outlook we gave in the second half revenue growth during our second quarter earnings call which we\u2019ll recall as we guided to 11% to 13%. For the year now, we expect revenue to be approximately $3.145 billion, reflecting constant currency were our growth of approximately 21% partially offset by 3% of FX headwind adjusting for the significant depreciation in FX principal to British pound, this is the high-end of the guidance we provided in July. This is also impressive performance by the team when compared to the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year, but revenue which you real we guided more than $3 billion and $3.1 billion in revenue. Adjusted EPS for the year is expected to between $5.45 and $5.48, which is up 21% to 22% excluding approximately $0.14 per share full year negative impact from FX. This reflects constant currency adjusted EPS growth of 24% to 25. This is up significantly from the guidance we provided in July and compares favorably to the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year for adjusted EPS with we remember was $4.95 to $5.05. For the year, we now expect adjusted EBITDA margins to expand by over 100 basis points up from the previous expectations, which was 75 basis points. As we look forward, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on a long term constant currency financial model of total revenue growth of 7% to 10% per year with organic revenue growth of 6% to 8%. As we look to 2017 considering only the acquisitions closed today with sort of refresh your memory will be there in the small Barnett acquisition. We expect to achieve revenue growth at the high end of our total growth model. As this is too early to make a call on the U.S. mortgage market, this is soon to the U.S. mortgage market will be largely flat in 2017 and as always, we\u2019ll provide you more detail on our outlook for 2017 during our February call, but this point in time with the way the team is executing on the growth initiative of EGI and NPI will remain very bullish for activities in 2017. So operator, with that John and I\u2019d like to open up the question for our participants. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from David Togut with Evercore ISI. David Togut : Thank you, good morning Rick, John and Jeff. Richard Smith : Hi, David. David Togut : Workforce Solutions continues to outperform my model both in the third quarter and indeed really year-to-date, could you comment a little bit about the hit ratio you're seeing as you approach the $300 million work number records in the U.S? Richard Smith : Yeah, I mean just talk generically then get the specifics, you heard before we talked in the past David, the things going on by growth perspective started with slowly Dann Adams five, six years ago continuing and rolling now are just phenomenon. There are so broad based . If you think about it, the penetration which is one way to think about hit rate in each vertical continues to go up. We continue to expand in the size of the database, continue to go to analytics on the data. Their growth opportunity and you know our long term model is very bullish presumably this is low double digits. Then their specific projects going on right now and continue to find ways to build the hit rate at work number of record. So generally speaking it is long term or highest growth opportunity business we have and we remain very bullish. David Togut : And combined with that your EBITDA margin at 47% up 350 basis points year-over-year, now actually approaching USCIS EBITDA margin, how do you think about the margin expansion opportunity of this business over the next 12 to 24 months? Richard Smith : Yes, as we\u2019ve talked in the past, this business - because of the great leverage we have most like the core USIS business are pockets of international, we get high incremental margin, especially in the verification side, but great things on the employer side at automation, enhance margin there. So there is no reasonable to believe that business over multiple years should not be approaching 50% plus our EBITDA margins. John Gamble : Yes, our long term model as we gave in right is direct to the in the low 50s and we fully expected to get there. David Togut : Got it. And then shifting gears to USCIS, mortgage continues to outperform and I thought your comment about next year and conservatively expecting flattish mortgage market. How do you think about the, what the Fed might do in the next couple months and how that might impact mortgage which has benefited from an incredibly positive environment with rates as low as they are? Richard Smith : Yes, I expect we are financing to issue and when they do get, they are all over the board, that\u2019s what we said in February we\u2019ll give you better look. We have hopefully some better insight that juncture. You're saying rate is from one rate increase to two to three rate increases up to 75 basis points as well as 25 basis points next year, still historically low rates, you may see some softening in refinancing, but continues to see good strength in home equity and home sales. I think the thing we'll keep our eye on in general terms on mortgages affordability sort of pricing it is pricing go across the country and what\u2019s affordability index work like. Beyond that there are so many great things we talk about that the team has done for, they done, I\u2019ve spent seven, eight, nine, 10 years which is outperform whatever the index does through penetration and innovation. And we talk about obviously trended data for Fannie Mae for USIS, we talk about the use now of the verification and employment, but it\u2019s just too small examples, but important examples of how we're trying to grow, we grow with the market does. David Togut : Understood. And just final question on trended data, just trying to assess competitively where you stand versus your Chicago based competitor which is also been pretty aggressive here, you\u2019re seem to have a very deep offering, they may have a little bit of a time lead, if that's an accurate perception, but it seems like you have a deeper range of services coming to market in the next 12 to 18 months? Richard Smith : I think I was trying to find a way around the trended data, we\u2019ve been very consistent with that. We were experience with out there first with batch trended there years ago. So clearly to you and that professional not the leaders, if you look at holistically to a batch and online, however we have moved aggressively have moved aggressively with years in all of our geographies to embrace trended data. I mentioned in my call, we have the most unique date assets, it was not just credit file, we talked that over an 18 months of trended data in Cambrian or in a local environment that's many different data assets, it\u2019s now just to credit file. And we're moving, you\u2019ll see this move dramatically beyond the 24 months of credit data that\u2019s trended in a production environment in 2017 well beyond even 30 months, which I think is a benchmark out in the marketplace today. So we're not handicapped in any, in fact I think we\u2019re leading in many senses on trended data. David Togut : Understood. Thank you very much Richard Smith : Thank you, David. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JP Morgan. Andrew Steinerman : Good morning, Rick. You mentioned 2017 are shaping up to be at the long term of a constant currency revenue growth range of 7% to 10%, I just want to check my math there that would be about two points of closed acquisition right, so we're talking 5% to 8% organic? And the second question is at that level of revenue growth where margin expansion pays above the long term range for 2017? Richard Smith : Yes, we\u2019re trying to say my word is there in total will be at upper end our 7% to 10%, so you can look what that means but\u2026 Andrew Steinerman : Okay. Richard Smith : \u2026comfortably in the upper end of that range, so the organic growth by default as your math to two points have to be within the organic range to 16%. But we also have a very strong pipeline of other M&A things we can be doing tuck-in acquisition that makes sense to us in all of our strategic areas and geographies around the world. So we\u2019ve been very disciplined this year with only the small acquisition of Barnett. We should expect is to be far and doing strategic M&A on top of that next year. And the margin, our target is to deliver 25 basis points per year of margin expansion over multiple years, so you should continue to expect margin expansion next year in that range. Andrew Steinerman : Okay. Thank you. Richard Smith : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Manav Patnaik : Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. Firstly congratulations on another broad based quarter. I'm sure we\u2019ll keep asking you for updates in trended area and the corrections contract and so forth, but what I wanted to ask you is of these 60 new products that you\u2019re scheduled to launch this year, as we look at into 2017 and 2018 like what are some of the other products or initiatives we should be focused on outside of just trended data and so forth. It sounded like the fraud platform you said that launch at next summer maybe one of those. I was hoping you could give us a sneak preview at other stuffs we should be looking out for ? Richard Smith : Thanks for that, thank you Manav for your kind words. NPI is so ingrained everything we do know. When you think about we're launching 50 to 75 products a year in this case 60 products. It's different by geography. Most of our NPI as you know tend to be singles and doubles of based up analogy. Everyone saw you hit some big ones like trended data. Fraud obviously is a very important growth opportunity for us in the international environment you talked, we talked about moving we call OSTRA [ph] around the world that will be a nice contributor. Mobile we\u2019re doing a lot now around the mobile world finding up ways to participate in the mobile environment, so that some great product launches planned later on this year and next year in mobile. 2002 is examples I can give you 100 more, but think about it, you can as you know we\u2019re so well. It\u2019s a lot of singles and doubles, that\u2019s what we win in NPI. Manav Patnaik : Okay. That\u2019s fair enough. And then just on the Credit Karma contracts, so I think in the past you gave us your revenue contribution from them I was hoping you could do that, that it does sound like the contract is much broader than what in the past, I think you guys were giving just reports and this course. I just wanted to confirm that if I heard that right. And in terms of expanding internationally when we heard from Credit Karma, the money 2020 conference, they mentioned Canada, but it\u2019s anything more than that you are referring to? Richard Smith : Yes, thank you. We don\u2019t disclose Credit Karma to tell you this, it has been great partnership, it has been a wonderful win-win partnership for two years. We\u2019ve now sign a multi-year contract much longer term, we utilize our environment Cambrian, which is different in the past it will be focus on innovation. So building products at Cambrian in together it will focus on our unique data assets way beyond this is the credit file itself. And then as you would tune your closing thoughts here you\u2019ll be going global as well and beyond Canada, our market discloses specific contracts, but there are some countries that they\u2019re very interested in and that we have a good market positions, good capabilities in, good data assets in together we both grow new business opportunities for us and consumers in those geographies is a really good, was a very complicated, long process, but the two team came to a great win-win for both of us for many years to come. Manav Patnaik : Got it. And just last question to me. When you start about this active M&A pipelines for some time now, I was hoping you could just characterize it in terms of the variance sizes of the deals you\u2019re looking at, because I think the one that you guys have rumor to be looking at in Australia, it seems a little bigger than tuck-in that I just was curious on, if you could give any color there? Richard Smith : Yes, I think known to three years, if you think about my revenues here with on three large deals we talks nine and half 10 years ago we did CSC, we did Veda, the vast majority of anything else we\u2019ve done a small tuck-in to this that one, two points to go per euro is our model you should expect us to be in that range looking for small tuck-in acquisitions we\u2019ll aligned our simple strategy, and one, two points of growth next year. Manav Patnaik : Okay, thanks a lot guys. Richard Smith : Thank you. Operator : Next we have George Mihalos with Cowen. George Mihalos : Great. Let me add my congratulations on another strong quarter guys. Wanted to start off, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not going to size the impact in the quarter of the trended data mortgage contribution, but is it, is it safe to say came in somewhere ball parking in a little bit below a percentage point of overall revenue growth. And then John, your comments on the margins for USIS, being I think at least 50% for 4Q, should we not expect a little bit of a step up from the 3Q levels given a full quarter trended data and then just sort of normal seasonality? Richard Smith : Let me jump into first part and John if you want to address margin and I\u2019ll give you general fit on margin. It won\u2019t go to break out trended data for as this specific line item. But do you think of this way the - as we set up guidance back in July, the second half of the year, and specifically for the third quarter the trended data contribution for USIS came in largely as expected almost no material deviation from our expectations, it was performing as expect is fairly predictable for us a model that contribution. As for as margins you\u2019ve got and you notice be a fluctuations month-by-month, quarter-by-quarter, there are mixed changes each and every quarter. The seasonality changes mortgage is lower volume in the fourth quarter, another quarter. So we put all together and I don\u2019t really worry about minor changes by quarter is really the multi-year trends in USIS start another very, very high margin trending. John Gamble : And you see really nice growth in that margin obviously in the third quarter, good performance in the second quarter. So I think the margin performance is accelerating and you should expect to continue to see very good margin accretion in the fourth quarter. We gave a range of over 50%, but you\u2019ll see very nice margin accretion of fourth quarter as well. And again consistent, the company\u2019s delivered outstanding performance overall, as we said year-to-year, USIS as a contributor to that and we expect it to continue and we feel very confident in our long term model moving towards 40% in our long term model. George Mihalos : Okay, great. Thanks for the color guys. And then just last question for me, as I relates to the Credit Karma expansion anything we should be mindful of from a pricing perspective as we model the consumer services, the consumer division go into 2017? Thank you. Richard Smith : Not, I descried really is an apples and orange contract. If we think the old contract there was one geography, one basic product in this, we alluded to this now multiple geographies, multi products and renovation. So it can be a growth driver for pro forma. It can be long term growth by process well. Operator : And next question comes from Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs. Andre Benjamin : Guys, good morning. As my first question, the lenders as we listen to commentary from large banks have been largely talking a lot about prime and super prime consumers, but I was wondering as you compare the roll out deeper analytic, how much your conversation is talking about the ability to Cambrian trended data, client data to get more comfortable lending to weaker credit consumer largely because I know when you frame trended data, you also talked about the uplift to prime loans with I don\u2019t know how but, what that\u2019s looks like for subprime as well? Richard Smith : Yeah. It is good question. So the answer is yes. So are and have actively engaged in leveraging our unique data assets to give the underwriters more holistic view of risk. And that could be as things like leveraging the - that the income data we have are not model but actual that income you can be using our NC plus database which gives inside to how consumers will pay off their utility obligations, may I have a score, in fact many of Latin America the credit markets, we are leveraging alternative data assets there to help bring people into the credit market. So that\u2019s an active part of our strategy and has been for the quite some time and will be going forward. Andre Benjamin : And more directly, is it fair to say that the uplift that you observe to analyzing some of those lower quality credits is the same or higher or lower relative to the prime bucket? Richard Smith : It really depends on the vertical you\u2019re looking at and geography you are looking. The work you might get in a credit card offering versus an auto loan would be difference in different parts of the country as well and will be different depending how you want segment subprime from super subprime. So then there is something they want is there\u2019s no one generic answer to get back and promise this out of the teams the DNA teams. I mentioned in my prepared comments are deeply engaged with our customers around the world looking at ways to make this smarter underwriting decisions including subprime. John Gamble : As far as that we launched using our alternative assets have brought a substantial number of additional consumers into the market where we can actually score them. Richard Smith : I think I gave you too - pay too less that in my prepared comments two examples here. Andre Benjamin : Yeah. My last would be, if I didn\u2019t miss it, where you stand on launching some of the verification process internationally and how that investment should impact the margins over the next couple of years? Richard Smith : Yeah, great, great, I don\u2019t think I did, I also I did not address it in my comments, but yes, it\u2019s going aggressively. I think all the enterprise growth initiative which are systematic way to manage complicated growth initiatives. The international word number is being managed through that initiative obviously with the team and we got a handful of countries are very, very important to us is going out as planned. Andre Benjamin : Thank you. Richard Smith : Thank you. Operator : Our next is question from Ramsey [ph] with Jefferies. Kristin Dahlberg : Hi, this is actually Kristin Dahlberg standing for Ramsey. Thanks for taking my questions. So USIS had very, very acceleration from the first half. Is your expectations still for the segment to be at the lower end of the 5% to 7% range, I mean it seems like with the new products and with such a robust mortgage market there could be some risk to the upside? Richard Smith : That you\u2019re referring to the fourth quarter or full year I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re saying next year or what you\u2019re referring to? Kristin Dahlberg : For the full year I believe you prioritize had been to the lower end of the 5% to 7% range? John Gamble : Yes, so for the fourth quarter we indicated we expected to be in the high end of the range. And for the full year it will be within the range absolutely. So, but first half starting slightly below the range, very good performance in the third quarter 9% we\u2019re expecting high end of the range in the fourth quarters only average those out will be nicely within the range for the full year. Kristin Dahlberg : Right. So I think last quarter you guys said that that it would be at the low end of the range, but now where just going to be somewhere inside the range is that correct? Richard Smith : Yes. John Gamble : Yes. Kristin Dahlberg : Okay. And my second question is there any way to parse out how much ACA has contributed a very robust growth within Workforce Solutions? Richard Smith : Well, I mentioned in my first comments and this has been couple of years in a row now it\u2019s extremely broad based, I want in different verticals ACA as we called Healthcare which ACA is a part of than offering with a 240% year-on-year, it\u2019s a good contributor, but there are so many other things going on across EWS driving growth it is far more of just ACA. John Gamble : And we give you verifier and we giving you and indication under growth of the other portions of employer, so there\u2019s quite a bit of information for you to do some analytics on that. Kristin Dahlberg : And then my last question is, have you been any surprises on the data integration so far and is the expectations still for EPS accretion of $0.20? Richard Smith : The answer to last part of the question is yes, and answer to the first part of the question is no, surprises I mean one time you buy a company you may have a surprise or never nothing material by any means. And it's going extremely well with we\u2019ll get numbers and view the team up here right now, team is down there. So it's your cultural integration will take as always does longer than process integration the acceptance from a customers of the things we can now bring to those markets has been wrongly receive, so all in all shown very well. Kristin Dahlberg : Great, thank you very much guys. Richard Smith : Thank you. Operator : Next we have Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Toni Kaplan : Hi good morning. Richard Smith : Good morning. Toni Kaplan : You mentioned the Fanny roll out of desktop underwriter integrating the employment and income verification. So when should we expect to see an impact from that in results and how could - how should you frame the lift that we should expect from that? Thanks. Richard Smith : That announced it I think was Monday or Tuesday of this week just takes a while to get this system - the underwriters changing behavior to do so there's a lot of opportunity for further penetration across the mortgage underwriter market. We have not financially disclosed what the lift would be for EWS, but clearly mortgage is an important part of what the banks do, mortgage is an important part of those and should be a growth driver for more I would say start in late 2016 and 2017. Toni Kaplan : Great. And then in terms of overall margins, in the past you\u2019ve given guidance target of about 25 basis points a year this year you'll be far above that as you mentioned in the earlier remarks and just what we've seen so far this year. Should we view 2017 as sort of a more normal year or would that still be elevated just given some of the large home run products that would still be flying through? Richard Smith : Let\u2019s say we\u2019ll give you more insights to silicon margin in 2017 in February. Remember our overall goal is to get 40% EBITD margin so in the years ahead. So we\u2019ll give you more color on saving, if I\u2019d expect 25 basis points or so next year. John Gamble : Again first to deliver on our long term model over the strategic period is kind of have to grow faster than that. And we're expecting - again we\u2019re expecting good another good year next year. Toni Kaplan : Thanks lot guys, congrats on the quarter. Richard Smith : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with R.B.C. Capital Markets. Gary Bisbee : Hi guys. Good morning. I guess I just wanted to ask Kathy, ask about the breadths of the various factors that are contributing to the EGI and NPI success this year. I mean obviously trended you said is sort of an outsized relative to the singles and doubles in target, but if you were to look at what you've done without trended is the momentum been in line with what it's been the last couple years, has it picked up and are there how do we think about the breadth of it? Thank you. Richard Smith : Hey Gary the kind of data as you may recall one life in August of 2016 and if you go back. So the EGI financial benefit and the NPI financial benefit are way, way, way beyond let trying do and now recall the exact numbers, but we talked about 2014, 2015 class of products in NPI being some more stronger classes in quite some time is not ever we talked about the full class in products in 2016 and with trends with one small part of that was up and shows your revenue some 170% above 2015. We talked about EGI our enterprise growth initiatives Gary, it ups and flows in one year or maybe eight big initiatives to I think the highest number when we were saying is 12, 13, 14 initiatives and in this case trying to see there is one piece of all those - in my prepared comments I talked about that being up some 35% I think it was over our expectations at the beginning of the year. So turn the data is important there's so much more going on in this company line innovation and growth initiatives just trying to do. John Gamble : And if you think about it every one to be used as the substantial EGI contributing, certainly you see front end in U.S. I ask you see in ACA and then other tremendous opportunities being delivered and Workforce Solutions the entire direct to consumer initiatives that you've heard about in GCS including the role out of the Renaissance\u2019s platform which we talked this quarter is the major driver in GCS, and THE great success in their management internationally driving growth also, right. So there's one in every BU as well ongoing success in NPI beyond that which is also substantial, so it's very broad based. Gary Bisbee : Okay great. And then just a follow-up question I given how strong and broad the result momentum has been this year are there any points this early in the process that you point out we should think about is really tough comp areas or anything for next year and I guess I trying to think about phasing of the U.K. contract to do we see Europe slow towards how you've described the longer term and in employer services is there ability maybe at least comment on those two to grow on top of such strong growth with ACA this year and anything else you can think of it? Richard Smith : Yes, there is a fact, you could talk in the micro stuff, but we go other micro head winds next year interest rate, I think they David Togut asked about. Mortgage - you said mortgage John was up strong double digit 25% or so, 30% this year. You should not expect and I said on my comments mortgage close to that next year and file to be could number. You always have the launches and for the challenge, Tray Walker [ph] and team have on NPI you have ramp ups of products and they do so right over some period of time with the next great product again I have been there for 11 years now, so that's nothing new. So specifically one part one part of your question which is a U.K. contract you should expect that a ramp in the next year and it went live within full year this year or rather full year next year so we expect that to continue ramp next year. So that was contemplated in the framework that John I gave you we talked about guidance for next year and the long term total growth rate 7% to 10%. John Gamble : And then we\u2019ve talked about Workforce Solutions and personal solutions that are both growing dramatically higher than their long term model. We said overtime they'll start to move back toward their model still with outstanding growth still next year growing incredibly well, but we had indicated they will start to move back forth their model overtime. Gary Bisbee : Great thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Otto Garrett with Deutsche Bank. Otto Garrett : Thanks for taking my questions. You guys have pointed out the strength that you\u2019ve seen within Workforce Solutions coming from your Healthcare or ACA compliance software this year, just as we think about going forward how much runway do we really have lacked as we think about 2017 are you likely to see the same kind of first half seasonality we saw this year? Richard Smith : May go generic and specific ACS generically there\u2019s a lot room we left in EWS to grow, there is show many levers they have to grow, ACA is one component of that. I would expect ACA had the surge of ACA in 2015 and 2016, it depends on what happens with fines into fines the intention of employers and then say renewed interest by another surge. Our expectation is ACA tends the module a bit going forward after two really good years, doesn\u2019t mean it goes negative or there's a problem growth the same rate has grown benefit 240% in the third quarter, but think about the overall model of EWS which is strong, strong up to single to low double digit growth and actually continue for not only 2017, but well beyond that. John Gamble : And in terms of the seasonality of ACA is the seasonal business there it's just from revenue recognition there's more revenue recognized in the first half and the second half because 1095 to deliver to employees in the first half, and of the way revenue recognition works you have to require - we have to record more of the revenue with the delivery of the product of 1095 then you do for the remainder of the year. So let\u2019s just accounting in terms of way revenue has recognized during the year. Otto Garrett : Great thanks. And you mentioned that now you have \u20ac1.6 billion already processed through that contract U.K. government and you're looking at on boarding two more government agencies just to happen - I came to discuss like what that's going to do the overall pipeline for the amount of debt that you\u2019re going to be placing of the contract and where you are and what there already been scared? Richard Smith : I alluded the fact there\u2019s early days right now Otto, not the primary focus right now is making sure we deliver the value proposition that the government expect on that \u00a31.6 billion and that \u00a31.6 billion grows great and we\u2019re saying our performance versus expectation from our prospective and our customers perspective which bodes well, but I continues that has effect because other A,B,C are doing some other data who want to break up the expectations at this juncture. We have more progress and the other agencies will be the first will you know that\u2019s gone. John Gamble : You do have to remember that HMRS is a contributor now and there are by far the largest sources of that, right, so, yes. Otto Garrett : Great thanks. And lastly just looking at your comments regarding the fourth quarter, you correct me if I misheard this, but I think you said that there is a $6 million incremental revenue headwind due to the depreciation in the British pound, now is that relative to what your expectations were when you last gave guidance in July or just want to think about how to frame that $6 million relative to your 4Q guidance? John Gamble : The $6 million FX headwinds since we gave guidance in July so versus our guidance in July. Otto Garrett : Got it. Okay, great. Thank you. And that's all for me. Richard Smith : Thank you. John Gamble : And specific to the fourth quarter to be clear, the $6 million is specific to the fourth quarter not the second half. Otto Garrett : Great. Operator : Next we have Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Andrew Jeffrey : Hi, good morning thanks for squeezing me in your desk. Lots of good information on a call as usual Rick, wanted to ask about data just in so far as it seems year-to-date that perhaps it's outperforming the expectations you had when you been you close the transaction, will we just characterize that and then as you think about Cambrian and NPI and enterprise investments in the region next year, what\u2019s the sort of ballpark organic revenue growth we should be thinking about for Veda? Richard Smith : As you mentioned Cambrian largely I take holistically when as expected maybe frankly slightly better than expected, when we talk about the increased discretion [ph] as one measure of that outperformance. As I mentioned in comments OSTRO was our flat platform and Cambrian and we will rolled out sometime mid way next year. I think about that as being in multi-year kind of the benefit. Yes, it takes a lot ramp that up and gain fractions I don't see significantly changing the financial performance of Veda in 2017. Veda we talk about being organic growth within our range to 6% to 8% over multiple years, and other thing we talked about is that Veda gives us access to all new geography, we\u2019ll look over months and years to come it using that platform to acquire other strategic assets in the region that make sense for us. Andrew Jeffrey : Okay. And if I can dig in just a little bit more on the TVX government contract quickly, can you just talk a little bit about how much of the total debt you might be able to address over time given that some of it is in collectible? Richard Smith : I\u2019m not sure. Thank about that. Andrew Jeffrey : I guess $22 billion or so. And maybe that's the wrong way to think about the TAM on that contract and if so distribution in nation? Richard Smith : We clearly not modeled for about quite that way, yes the universe of opportunities \u00a322 billion focused now and stuff that give us today, make sure is the right quality, right mix of that and our teams performing analytics at the right level to provide value that's to me case I'm a firm believer if you prove value to the customer in this case U.K. government they will contain to file ways to expand not only a \u00a31.6 billion up and get other agencies to contribute as well. So all over enjoy now is making sure deliver on the promise from the government. John Gamble : As important to remember that those agencies do collect some of the debts themselves internally. Richard Smith : Absolutely. John Gamble : Right, and have the right to do the within the contract. So at this point it\u2019s unclear is to what that mix will be overtime. Richard Smith : So when we\u2019re saying there is other \u00a322 billion they find a piece we think we get or analyst get add value they place that source so as we continue to add value and increase the risk on the collectability that give us more of it, don't think about doing all \u00a320 billion. Andrew Jeffrey : Okay, all right. Thank you. Richard Smith : Thank you. Operator : Next we have Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Bill Warmington : Under the wire, thank you very much. Congratulations on the strong organic growth. So one question for you, on mortgage related revenue it look like it was about 18% of total revenue just wanted to confirm that first? And then I think in your comment you mentioned that you view the mortgage market, your assumption for 2017 was at the mortgage market was going to be flat. So the NBA forecast that came at on Tuesday is projecting the 2017 market down 14% on a dollar basis, so assuming price appreciation on houses of maybe 6%, I get it to around 20% down in terms of unit volumes. So I guess my question is the expectation that the higher revenue per unit on trended data and the Fannie Mae do you validation service is going to be able to and other products are going to be able to offset that expected to decline in unit volume that the rationale? Richard Smith : Bill we don\u2019t - the mortgage business in U.S. is important for customers and is important for us. We told you we\u2019re in the range of 15% to 20% of revenue comes from mortgage related activities we\u2019re clearly still in that range we expect to stay that range by the balance of the year. If you go back and look historically at the mortgage banking index and forecast versus actual it's all over the board. We take a series of economists including our own economists and analyze different trends and from that make assumptions we've build guidance for we're going to historically that was in the framework we just gave you a flat next year. We\u2019re going to allow lot more come February. All trying to do for you as you have big more year you can make your assumption we think mortgage market is going to do. We think at this juncture a market performing someone at flat range is reasonable and we've - the market has been a long for a number of years on low side and high side lot more in February that\u2019s a good starting point for us. Bill Warmington : Okay fair point on the MBA forecast its\u2019 stuff. All right, well thank you very much and again congratulations on the strong quarter. Thank you. Richard Smith : Thank you. Operator : Next we have Jeff Meuler with Baird. Jeff Meuler : Hey good morning. How verifications services solutions of overtime and taken the things like more attributes collected you hit tightly on analytics maybe better leveraging the historical records, but if you could talk about innovation in that segment specifically and how much of the growth drives? Thank you. Richard Smith : Yes, it's important. So as I think about it Jeff, its continue to - workers to database, it\u2019s continue to penetrate more and more verticals at deeper level when we talk in the past by the automotive, car and others been good penetration to lot room to go still room to go and penetrating the mortgage market. We just talked about launching verifications business on global basis that\u2019s early days that\u2019s now I think pays dividends three, four, five, 10 years down the world as along from great growth level analytics will be important with this well so truly very broad based. John Gamble : Also there\u2019s been a lot of innovation and the way be obtain records and partners, right. So a lot of the investment has been around building our partnerships to get more records faster and also about the technology that we used to allow smaller employers to much more easily board their records aquabats [ph] so they get a benefits at a much, much lower cost. Jeff Meuler : Okay, thank you. And then finally John, can you just comment on year-to-date free cash flow and the full year expectation? John Gamble : Sure, so year-to-date free cash flow you think continues to be very strong, we\u2019re expecting to a have very strong fourth quarter. So for the full year we're expecting our free cash flow to be very, very good, you continue to be good as it has been. So little below where it was last year generally because in a year we have very strong earnings like we had last year, we pay out all of our incentive compensation in the next year it tends to drive down cash flow in the year following a very strong year, and we've got a little bit weaker working capital which we're working on to recover, so we're very strong free cash down. Jeff Meuler : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi good morning, thank you for taking my questions. Rick, can you give a little bit more of an update on Europe, it looks to me if I normalize for the FX headwinds in the quarter on a sequential basis the European business seems flat sequentially understand that do you have good growth year-over-year. But I would have expected it that the U.K. government contract would have put in some work growth there. Can you talk about some of the dynamics that are going on because of Brexit outside of FX in Europe? Richard Smith : Yes I have a numbers converted, maybe John does, but overall Europe continues to perform and year-on-year growth is good, and lot of things we are seeing is that the Brexit has create some uncertainty for the U.K. market and kind of a pause button if you will for some of our customers into a little slower in their activity there maybe we expected. But where that goes it's hard to say I mean it's still two year time on before the full exit. But overall you think about the U.K. you think about Spain, you think about that universe which we operate the team has continued to deliver solid growth results in a very custodies environment. John Gamble : And the pattern of our revenue sequentially is fairly normal with what you\u2019d normally see in Europe. Yes we\u2019re seeing growth in the U.K. government contract, but again it\u2019s not the largest piece of revenue we have in Europe, Europe obviously our traditional business is much larger. So we are seeing continued growth, but the pattern of revenue looks very normal for us. Richard Smith : This is almost Spain continues to do some amazing things and deliver some great results largely by NPI. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay that's a good color. And then so where we in terms of being able to use the U.K. government as a model for other countries, is there enough data that you can able to prove that you can do it or do you feel like you need maybe another year or before you can take it out to some other countries like that? Richard Smith : Well I think, I announced last quarter, the fact that we want a significant multi-year contract that would arrive this split on this year in the U.K. in Canada. So we're - we have operations in Australia, we have operations now in Central and South America specific to the IRS equivalents around the world. We're not yet attack those opportunities, we\u2019re attacking our traditional customer base with the analytics capability in many countries it's already revenue with force. Shlomo Rosenbaum : So from a government standpoint that\u2019s out there, but not as fast as it is in the commercial standpoint is that the way to think? Richard Smith : We just stood up a global government vertical, so standing up now last in a couple months that global government vertical all of our capabilities to bear to the governments around the world that make sense including the debt management collects analytics platform of Inffinix and TDX. So it's not yet yielding revenue, because we had not yet intentionally focused on it outside the U.K. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. Understand and then question I've asked you guys before just where do you stand in terms of getting some of your existing ACA clients to contribute their income data to the talk database. Richard Smith : Yes they done a great job, and systematically I think we talk about it in the first quarter I can\u2019t remember when it was we talked about in technology that allows it to be easier for the ACA platform users to onboard their records to us. So that was launched sometime this year Jeff Dodge and his team member and that was roughly second quarter. That was on the second quarter of this year, so we had a technology capability and it is a contributed to date to the odd number of growth that we're seeing. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay, great. Thank you. Richard Smith : Thank you. Operator : Next we have Tim McHugh with William Blair. Tim McHugh : Yes, thanks. Most of my questions have been asked, but just one, maybe Latin America if I missed it, but the growth it's kind of gradually slowed a little bit the last week orders, anything happening there, I guess that explain to that and any reason to expect that well accelerate obviously on a constant currency basis? John Gamble : Argentina is our largest country in the region, obviously Argentina\u2019s GDP growth is negative this year. So their performance are little weaker, but now we don\u2019t think so, we think Latin America continues to be an opportunity for us to grow. Richard Smith : Yes, one thing that Tim, that gives me great hope to Latin America, it\u2019s a great market forces as you know Johnson has been for years. I'm more bullish what the outlook for Argentina the government is doing locally in Argentina to fuel growth and the economist now see that that the projections for GDP growth for the outer years are stronger than a same quite some time. The projections for currency stabilization are better than that we've seen some time I guess another year, the forecasts right now we have for Argentina, John just alluded to is negative this year about a percentage, so GDP growth in the next three years the consensus forecast is between 3% and 4% GDP growth in 2017 and 2018 and 2018. So we're in a good position in Argentina, we\u2019re leader in Argentina in all verticals, analytics as well the core credit business. So I think better days ahead in Argentina when you see that that you see an updraft in Germantown\u2019s Latina America. Tim McHugh : Can you give us, is there any - would you be willing to tell us roughly how much in Latin America we should think about is coming from Argentina? Richard Smith : It's our largest operation in Latin America more than size that is rolling. Tim McHugh : Okay, thank you. Richard Smith : Thank you. Operator : And our last question comes from Brett Huff with Stephens. Brett Huff : Good morning thanks for taking my question. So just two one, first of all, you\u2019ve already called the season in the high end of your long term revenue growth range next year, but even given that break, is there any product or segment that you feel particularly hopeful about that if there's upside to that outlook where might that come from? Richard Smith : I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any one lever that on NPI EGI that gives us maybe at the business unit level. As I've said for quite some time EWS it's got the longest growth potential we have and now go through in 2017 as well. But the neat thing is the performance part as you\u2019ve seen so broad based comes verticals countries be used EGI and products. Might there be another big EGI that comes up or another big NPI may come up, I think mobile are some really interesting opportunity for us. I think fronted data, we are just a credit file offer some opportunity for us maybe will see this underwriter that\u2019s got rather platform that\u2019s incorporating the use of verification and employment that might provide from upside, but it\u2019s really is not broad based. Brett Huff : Okay and then the second question is again all the bigger picture is you guys have done a good job of creating or buying a proprietary database is you kind of using conjunction with a credit card that differentiate your products, what is the next phase of that is there a particular database or type of data that you're looking to build or buy the next to US so the next telco credit filing anything like that? Richard Smith : Yes we have in trade organization of the data analytics team is a strategy that's linked to each country in every vertical of the country. So we now stop people not generic answer might be in Argentina in the auto vertical is the data we want to buy a global partner with Australia might be something different there. So and that's a big core part of our strategy so we don't tend to vote on the forward looking basis which has that we want to build the right, but the one we have talking about you seen this is the work number is very strong global. Brett Huff : Great, thanks for the time. Richard Smith : Thank you. Jeff Dodge? Jeff Dodge : Yes, I'd like to thank everybody for their time and their support and interest in Equifax. And with that, operator we'll terminate the call. Operator : And that concludes our presentation. We thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Dodge. Please go ahead. Jeff Dodge : Thanks and good morning everyone. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Jeff Dodge, Investor Relations. And with me today are Rick Smith, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com. During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain Risk Factors inherent in our businesses are set forth in filings with the SEC including our 2015 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. Also we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA margin, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance. For the fourth quarter of 2016, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes acquisition related amortization expense, the transaction and integration expenses associated with our acquisition of Veda, the charge for our settlement with the CFPB which was announced earlier this year, and a charge for the realignment of internal resources which is largely concentrated in the International business segment. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as net income attributable to Equifax adding back income tax expense, interest expense net of interest income, depreciation, amortization and the impact of certain one-time items including the transaction and integration expenses associated with the acquisition of Veda, the charge for our settlement with the CFPB, and the charge for the realignment of internal resources. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our website. Please refer to our various investor presentations which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website for further details. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Rick. Rick Smith : Thanks, Jeff, and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us especially those who are up in the Northeast have got some inclement weather, we appreciate that. Not a very strong broad based performance in the fourth quarter completes which I think you will agree with an outstanding year for Equifax. The operating DNA of this company has enabled us to consistently and successfully execute the strategy that we've been pursuing now 11.5 years. With the momentum the team has created, I feel very good as is John about how we are positioned for continued solid growth in 2017; we will talk about that in fair amount of detail in my closing comments. Our performance for the fourth quarter was outstanding as this team sets up and delivered beyond our expectations. Total revenue for the quarter was $801 million, up 20% on reported basis and up 23% on local currency basis from 2015. For the quarter FX created a $20 million year-over-year headwind. The adjusted EBITDA margin was up 200 basis points year-on-year, up from 34.5% a year ago to 36.5% this year. Adjusted EPS was $1.42, up 25% from $1.14 last year and exceeded the upper end of the guidance range we provided to you, which was between $1.35 and $1.38. And given the strong performance in 2016, the Board of Directors approved an 18% increase in our quarterly dividend, which now is $0.39 a quarter. This is the seventh consecutive double-digit increase in our dividend rate. As I look back at the full-year of 2016 it too was another record performance and one we're very, very proud of on many fronts from integrating our acquisition of Veda, which was the largest in our company's history, to delivering results that exceeded our expectations again on NPI, EGI, LEAN, customer LEAN and just overall execution of many programs across the globe. For the year, total revenue was $3.1 billion, up 18% on a reported basis, and up 21% on a local currency basis versus 2015. For the year, FX created a $75 million year-over-year headwind. Organic constant currency growth was a very strong 12% for 2016. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.8% for the year, up 110 basis points from 34.7% in 2015 and that was well above the guidance we provided at the beginning of the year. Adjusted EPS was $5.52, up 23% from $4.50 a year ago and that was up significantly from the original guidance we gave you a year ago, which was between $4.95 and $5.05. Let me go through some of the business unit commentary and I will come back and talk you about some of the corporate highlights and then John will go into the financial details and also talk about framework probably thinking about 2017 as well. First, with USIS, they delivered a strong 7% growth in the fourth quarter ending the year with an impressive 6% revenue growth which was nicely above our expectations for the year. Some individual highlights for USIS : in December, we executed an enterprise-wide agreement with a world-class Silicon Valley firm to provide a number of products including our household income estimate, which will be used by the customers to select consumer audiences towards they want to advertise and promote products. This is a multi-year agreement that we will expect to position us very well in the digital marketing space in 2017 and beyond is what our first big foray of the digital marketing. We continue to make significant progress with some of our large financial institutions regarding opportunities to assets or Cambrian platform. Our customers are seeking greater speed to market and the Cambrian platform and demonstrably reduced development times for months to days. The co-development relationships we created trended data attributes, integrate their customer data and deliver more frequent redevelopment of decisioning solutions. These opportunities significantly enhance our relationships by deeply embedding Cambrian and our local expertise into our customers' development and go-to-market strategies. USIS fraud authentic management solutions continue to trend strong double-digit growth growing 21% for the year. While years it has been a big focus for us, an area where we are continuing to invest in both platforms and capabilities. We also achieved a significant milestone in the year launching online trended data solution for mortgage market or with our partner Fannie Mae. This solution contributed significantly to USIS revenue growth in 2016 and will make people more contributions to growth in 2017. Well still early there are some additional very promising opportunities to leverage credit data information to improve decisioning in other emerging categories. Automotive is one that we are very excited about for an example. In 2017, we launched an EGI focus specifically on trended data solutions. Our efforts include all of our major data assets trending data for up to 72 months and across all of our key verticals. We will also apply machine learning algorithms to assist and develop high value credit data attributes. This effort will be globally focused on U.S., Canada, Australia, and key countries in Europe and in Latin America. One last highlight for USIS is our commercial financial network comprises of tradeline data from banking and other financial institutions. Similar to the SBFE as well as communications, utility, wholesale trade, printing, publishing, chemicals, rental, and leasing data on approximately 30 million small businesses that provides very strong market position and enables us to offer our customers very unique and powerful decision solutions. Our CFN data is populated in Cambrian along for decisioning solutions that combine both our commercial and our consumer data. On to international, they delivered 54% local currency growth in the year 2016, organic constant currency growth was a strong 12% driven by double-digit growth in our Latin American and Europe, along with inorganic contribution from our acquisition of Veda almost a year ago. EBITDA margin increased over 200 basis points to 28.3%. Revenue from international's four largest verticals FI, SMEs, Telcos, and government represent almost 84% of organic revenue growing impressive 30% in 2016. Decisioning platforms and local services and debt management revenue delivered organic growth of very impressive 24% for the year. The team has done an outstanding job with the integration of Veda into the Equifax family. As a result, we are rapidly approaching a business as usual state for the business. For the year, Veda delivered the financial performance we were expecting and have previously communicated to you. Equifax COE sort of excellence model has been stood up with a formal operations function, a lean rebuild program, integration into our new product innovation process, and operating process including our global finance and human resource systems. We have also initiated a number of global platform deployments including fraud, Cambrian, interconnect on accelerated timeline, those were keys for us to generate incremental long-term revenue as you recall in that part of the world and we're ahead of schedule. We have also identified a number of Veda products that represent a potential to take their products to other segments, other geographies around the world, and our product teams are doing that as we speak. The teams in Australia and New Zealand have collaborated well with their counterparts in the U.S. and international. As a result, this has been one of the smoothest acquisition integrations, we've experienced here at Equifax. Our debt management business in the UK with UK government is performing very well. Revenue for 2016 exceeded the budget; we awarded all six of the founding government agencies and have added an additional agency in Ministry of Justice. We have signed additional contract for work and development and new debt solutions for HMRS which is the largest entity of the government we are dealing with right now. And most importantly, the team has exceeded the collection performance expectations that the client and we have established a year ago. In December, our UK operations leveraged the partnership we have with a very good global partner LexisNexis and have executed in UK a 10-year multi-million dollar agreement. We are provisioning data and jointly developing product offerings for their customers in the UK. Latin America continues to broaden its product portfolio, expand its set of solutions with socioeconomic information and geographic analysis to enhance customers marketing decisions in Chile and Peru. New product innovation in Canada is accelerating; and looks very promising for growth opportunities this year and beyond. In the fourth quarter, our Cambrian data analytics platform was launched enabling them to develop powerful trended data solutions for our customers across all verticals in Canada. The Canadian team also won and implemented our first major debt management contracts with very large strategic customer in Canada. And we're also fast forward as we launch our workforce solutions business in Canada, while the services and strategies will differ slightly from our U.S. based business we will be able to leverage the IT investments to operating platform and processes, we develop accelerating our time to launch in Canada and solve problems for our good customers, we couldn't solve before. Speaking of workforce solutions what a year they had, yet another outstanding performance, revenue was up 22% for the year, along with a very, very impressive 310 basis points margin expansion and the adjusted EBITDA margin. That business continue to reinforce power, innovation and execution as we develop new solutions for our customers. Verification services with very strong growth for 2016 was driven by double-digit growth across virtually all verticals including mortgage, auto, consumer finance, government, card, and predeployment. At the year-end 2016, the Work Number database approached 300 million records to over 7,100 companies contributing to that database. We're very excited about Fannie Mae's decision to incorporate our employment and income verification services into their underwriting platform. While the revenue impact for 2016 was minimal, the opportunities for 2017 and beyond are expected to be significant as it positions the workforce solutions as a premier provider of important and critical underwriting decision in the area of VOE and VOI. The auto vertical is a key focus for employment and income verification and we've made great progress in 2016. In 2017, we will further our presence in the industry through the partnership with Pfizer. As some of you may already know, we recently announced a partnership with Pfizer which integrated our employment and income verification services into their automotive loan originations system. Pfizer was one of the top providers of loan origination and servicing systems completing almost 5 million originations in 2016. Customers will now be able to quickly retrieve income deployment data and approve applications quicker for fewer stipulations and errors. Employer services they also had outstanding year in 2016 growing 24% for the year. Unemployment claims, I9, and tax management services which represent almost 80% of employer services revenue grew a very good 7%, particularly impressive given the very low unemployment claims environment. Our Workforce Analytics business, which provide solutions to allow employers to ensure their compliance with the Affordable Care Act grew substantially in 2016. John will provide more detail in our ACA-related revenue in 2016 and the expectations that we have with the regulatory changes we expect ahead of the earnings financial review that follows. On to our Global Consumer Solutions they grew 16% for the year and on reported revenue an 18% growth on local currency basis. That was just an outstanding performance. GCS also delivered a 30.3% adjusted EBITDA margin for the year. Our direct to consumer resellers which include great partners like Credit Karma, White Rock and number of others are driving good growth for us. In the fourth quarter, we signed as you never call a multi-year contract extension with Credit Karma representing almost comprehensive and largest in the company's history. They will also be using our Cambrian platform to provide greater credit insights to their consumer base and to better target more relevant offers. As many of you know LifeLock has been acquired by Symantec who operates on a global scale. We have a very good relationship with LifeLock and view this project as we anticipate even more opportunities for global expansion and revenue growth for GCS. International revenue for GCS was up a solid 7% for the year. Finally, we completed development of our new platform for GCS, we call that Renaissance. We talk about that before, it gives us great flexibility in building changing product offerings to the market and that is now going for GCS. Well John will give his comments on the financials let me transition back to corporate and talk about a few highlights at the corporate level. I will start with our 2016 class and new product launches, it was the strongest in the history of our company. For the year, we launched 53 products and our NPI revenue was 9.2% overall our target for the year. We feel very good about our ability to continue driving meaningful growth through our innovation process. Over the past few years, we have re-launched NPI we've talked to you about this; we called it NPI 2.0 that was really focused on increasing the funnel of ideas and improving our execution and importantly shortening our time to revenue. I can tell you that the NPI 2.0 the great work that the marketing team has done is working. As a result, the anticipated year three revenue for 2016 launch is expected to be almost five times what we expected full-year revenue to be from our 2014 launch that is really impressive. And the pipeline on 2017 launches is off to a great start with an initial portfolio of 106 products in the funnel. Also, our data and analytics platform Cambrian has significantly enhanced our product development cycle time and quality and value of our new offerings, the technology infrastructure continues to support our growth initiatives, the contemporary platforms or global capabilities include fraud, the consumer solutions, we did Renaissance, Cambrian, and our interconnect just to name a few. Operationally, our enterprise growth initiatives exceeded their target by almost 50% for the year that bodes well for 2017. And our lean initiatives exceeded their target by almost 30%. On the regulatory front, we most likely read that we reached a settlement with the CFPB and the CIV rate issues in connection with our Global Consumer Solutions business. The settlement requires changes to be made in how we market, to interact with our consumers who come to our website at www.equifax.com, many require changes were implemented more than two years ago, this settlement and our obligations under it do not change in anyway the opportunities for the financial health of that business. Additionally, the CFPB has closed their CIV investigation of the Workforce Solutions business that we talked about in the past with you. Obviously, we're going to have both of these issues behind us. That's my opening comments. With that let me turn over to John for some financial details and I will close out the call before we go to Q&A with a look at 2017. John? John Gamble : Thanks, Rick, and good morning everyone. Before I will generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis. USIS revenue in the 4Q 2016 was $316 million, up 7% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. For the full-year, revenue of $1.2 billion was up 6%. This compares favorably to our original expectations for USIS to be at the low-end of their 5% to 7% growth. The adjusted EBITDA margins for USIS was 51% in 4Q 2016 and 50.2% for calendar year 2016, up 230 and 40 basis points respectively. This is the first time USIS has delivered full-year adjusted EBITDA margins in excess of 50% an outstanding performance. Online information solutions revenue was $211 million in 4Q 2016, up 4% year-to-year and $879 million for the full-year also up 4% when compared to the prior year. Total mortgage-related revenue was up 41% and 36% in the quarter for USIS and Equifax respectively. We also saw a mix shift towards mortgage solutions versus online in 4Q versus 3Q. For calendar year 2016, mortgage-related revenue was up 25% and 24% for USIS and Equifax respectively and represented just under 18% of total Equifax revenue. Our 4Q and calendar year 2016 growth compared favorably to the average mortgage bankers application index, which was up 1% in the fourth quarter and 17% for the calendar year. Mortgage solution revenue was $36 million in 4Q 2016, up 29% year-to-year and $142 million for the calendar year, up 15%. Financial Marketing Services revenue was $69 million in 4Q 2016, up 7% year-to-year and up $215 million for calendar year 2016, up 5% year-to-year. Identity and fraud solutions also continues to grow strongly, up 15% in 4Q and 21% for calendar year 2016 driven largely by our multi-factor authentication and IT management solutions. U.S. direct to consumer revenue principally our online revenue with other CRAs was down almost 30% in the quarter and 20% for calendar year 2016. The decline in these customers negatively impacted USIS growth by over two points in 4Q 2016 and approximately 1.5 in 2016. The impact on OIS in 4Q 2016 was over 300 basis points, up over 100 basis points from the impact in 3Q 2016. Workforce Solutions revenue was $174 million in the quarter, up 21% year-to-year and $702 million in calendar year 2015, up 22% year-to-year. The Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margin was 45.8% in 4Q 2016 and 48.2% in calendar year 2016, up a very strong 150 basis points and 310 basis points respectively. This reflects continued very strong growth in verification services, up 24% in the fourth quarter and 20% year-to-year. Employer Services also delivered a very strong performance up 15% in 4Q 2016 and 24% in calendar year 2016. As Rick indicated, our unemployment, I9, and tax services products offered independently and through our compliance center offering represent almost 80% of Employer Services revenue and grew stronger than expected in 4Q, up 16% with organic growth of over 10% and up 7% for calendar year 2016. Our ACA Solutions delivered high single-digit percentage growth in 4Q 2016. As a reminder, total revenue related to the Affordable Care Act in 2016 was only 2% to 2.5% of Equifax total revenue. Approximately 75% of that revenue was in workforce analytics, a part of employer services, which provides a service to ensure employers are in compliance with the employer mandate of the ACA, margin for this products are below the average for Workforce Solutions. The remaining 25% is in verification services, where it provides current income validation for people who enroll in the Healthcare Exchange through Federal or state sites. This was part of the means test and had margins higher than the Workforce Solutions average. Our current planning reflects the expected repeal or substantial modification of the ACA including an expected transition period, so that the repeal or modification takes effect in 2018 or later. As such, we expect our ACA revenue to be about flat in 2017 with 2016. Combined revenue for USIS and Workforce Solutions, our total U.S. B2B revenue was $490 million in 4Q 2016, representing growth of 11%. Full-year revenue was $1.9 billion also up 11%. International's revenue was $212 million in 4Q 2016, up 49% on a reported basis and up 62% on a local currency basis. Revenue was $804 million for calendar year 2016, up 41% on a reported basis and up 54% on a local currency basis. Constant currency organic growth in international was a strong 13% in 4Q 2016, the strongest quarterly organic growth for the year and 12% for calendar year 2016. International's adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.3% in 4Q 2016 and 28.3% in calendar year 2016. By region, Europe's revenue was $64 million in 4Q 2016, up 4% in U.S. dollars and up 21% in local currency. For calendar year 2016, Europe revenue was $254 million, up 7% in U.S. dollars and up 18% in local currency reflecting the impact of the sharp drop in FX rates in the second half due to Brexit. Latin America's revenue was $48 million in 4Q 2016, down 4% in U.S. dollars but up 11% in local currency. Revenue was $184 million for calendar year 2016, down 8% in U.S. dollars again but up 12% in local currency. Latin America showed outstanding local currency growth throughout 2016 led by strong growth across Argentina, Chile, and Paraguay. Canada revenue was $31 million, up 4% in U.S. dollars and up 4% in local currency. Revenue for calendar year 2016 was $122 million flat in U.S. dollars, but up 3% in local currency. Asia-Pacific revenue was $71 million in 4Q and $244 million for the year. As Rick mentioned, for 2016, data performed well and ahead of our expectations. Global Consumer Solutions revenue was $99 million in 4Q 2016, up 18% on a reported basis and up 20% on a local currency basis. Revenue in calendar year 2016 was $403 million, up 16% on a reported basis and up 18% on a local currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 34.5% in 4Q 2016 and 30.3% for the calendar year. Our B2C business grew over 35% in 4Q 2016 and was up 60% in calendar year 2016. Our consumer business both directly through Equifax.com and through indirect white label applications grew almost 5% in 2016 despite the tremendous growth free offerings that drove the growth of our B2C business. In the fourth quarter, general corporate expense was $69 million. Excluding the integration expenses associated with the Veda acquisition, the CFPB settlement, and the realignment charge, general corporate expense was $56 million and in line with the expectation we indicated during our 3Q earnings call. For calendar year 2016, corporate expense excluding the Veda integration expense and the other one-time items was $210 million, up from $198 million or 7% from 2015, driven by an increase in technology spend as we expand our global technology platforms. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 36.5% in 4Q 2016 and 35.8% in calendar year 2016, up 200 basis points and 110 basis points respectively. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 31.7%. This was modestly lower than expected primarily reflecting a decrease in the tax rate in some foreign jurisdictions. For the full-year, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 31.8%. Looking forward into 2017, our expectation for the effective tax rate is approximately 32.5%. For 1Q 2017, our expectation is for the effective tax rate to be slightly above 33%. Operating cash flow was $260 million in 4Q 2016 and $785 million in calendar year 2016. Free cash flow equal to operating cash flow less capital expenditures was very strong in 2016 at $618 million. We expect free cash flow to be up again in 2017 however as in past years; 1Q will be weaker than the other quarters due to employee variable compensation payments following a very strong performance in 2016. Capital spending, which includes our capital expenditures in the period plus commitments we have made that will be paid in 2017, were $53 million in the quarter and $192 million for calendar year 2016 just over 6% of revenue. As we look forward into 2017, we expect capital spending to again be about 6% of revenue and in the range of our long-term model of 5% to 6% of revenue. Total debt at year-end was $2.67 billion. We continue to reduce our leverage following the Veda acquisition which is now down to 2.39 times EBITDA. Depending on the pace of acquisitions, we expect to be repurchasing shares again in the second half of 2017. Now let me turn it back to Rick for a for a discussion of our 2017 outlook, for perspective, the outlook for 1Q 2017 and 2017 that Rick will discuss is based on foreign exchange rates as of February 1, 2017. Rick Smith : Thanks, John. I will start with some summary comments for the corporation and give you some framework thoughts at the BU level and then will go to operator for the questions they may have. 2016 quickly in summary, I think on so many dimensions characterizes what I would say is the best year since I joined the company 11.5 years ago. Each of the business units delivered outstanding performance to leverage our key disciplines around new talent acquisition, new product innovation, enterprise growth initiatives, value-based pricing, enterprise channels, and marketing verticals, acquisition integration, all the things this company has done, I think fairly well for the past 10 or 11 years. These disciplines have been routinely refined and are integral to the execution of our overall strategic initiatives. These disciplines will also make important contributions to what we feel strong 2017 and beyond. During our third quarter earnings release in October we shared with you our preliminary views on the revenue growth through 2017. At that time, we stated that we remained confident in our ability to deliver revenue growth at the high-end of our long-term constant currency financial model which you know is 7% to 10%. We also indicated that our outlook was based upon a flat mortgage market. Since that time, as you know since the elections, the outlook for the mortgage market has deteriorated significantly and while these estimates vary a great deal depending on who you want to talk to, the consensus, these originations to be down double-digits in 2017. Our current outlook is for mortgage originations to be down about 50% in 2017 and flat to slightly down in the first quarter. In addition, our expectation for ACA revenue in 2017 is flat when compared to 2016. As John discussed, in 2016, ACA was very nice growth driver for EWS and for Equifax. Combined, these two items, ACA and mortgage versus the discussion back in October represent about approximately 3% headwind to our 2017 growth when compared to October expectation. However with that headwind, we still remain very confident that we can offset the mortgage and ACA drag and deliver total constant currency revenue growth in 2017 in the top half of our long-term 7% to 10% range. We are exiting 2016 with strong momentum across our businesses driven by new product innovation and expectations for accelerated growth in our non-mortgage segments of USIS, Workforce Solutions, and continued very good performance from GCS and International. So with that preamble, as a result our guidance for 2017 is for total revenue to be between $3.375 billion and $3.425 billion, reflecting constant currency revenue growth of 8% to 9%, partially offset by approximately 1% of FX headwinds. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $5.96 and $6.10 which is up 8% to 10% year-on-year excluding slightly over $0.02 per share negative impact from FX. This reflects constant currency earnings per share growth of 9% to 11%. We also expect adjusted EBITDA margin to expand by at least 100 basis points for the full-year coming off again another 110 basis point expansion in 2016. Onto the individual business units, I will give the framework here, first USIS growth we expect that to be somewhat below their long-term range of 5% to 7% reflecting the expected weak mortgage market we've discussed. EBITDA margins are expected to increase slightly from very strong levels delivered in 2016. Workforce Solutions is expected to deliver growth at or above the high-end of their long-term growth range, which you'll remember is 9% to 11% and that is despite again the expected weak mortgage market and flat ACA business versus historically a growth ACA business. EBITDA margins are also expected to increase from strong levels delivered in 2016. GCS is expected to continue its growth above its long-term growth range of 6% to 8% with EBITDA margins above -- remaining about 30%. International is expected to deliver growth above their long-term model of 8% to 10% principally driven by another record year of NPI organic growth and the growth from Veda acquisition; we get approximately two months of incremental benefit in 2017 versus 2016. EBITDA margins are expected to increase nicely. We see 30% in international for 2017. Quick look at the quarter. For the first quarter we expect total revenue between $822 million and $826 million reflecting constant currency revenue growth of 14% partially offset by almost 1% of FX headwind. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.39 and $1.42 for the quarter which is up 13% to 15% excluding just under $0.01 per share negative impact from FX. This reflects constant currency organic growth of 14% to 16% for the first quarter. One final announcement before we open up for Q&A and that is that we got a individual amongst us very important partner for us who is after 25 great years with the company has announced he's going to be retiring, he's going to leave us Jeff Dodge, we will see on the phone no Jeff intimately and all of us around this table thanks Jeff for a fabulous 25 years. Jeff has been doing great work since my last 12.5 years you've even held the job. And there will be plenty of time for farewells and fanfare and [indiscernible] where you can gather en suite for those of you interact with Jeff. We also are pleased to announce we have got a very smooth and thoughtful transition plan that we have announced here internally and that is Doug Brandberg he was with us here this morning. Doug will be transitioning into the role it will be a smooth process we have been working together already for a couple of months and Doug will shadow work with Jeff and with John Gamble for the entire year and calendar year from now for the start of 2018, will be ready to take over the IR role. Doug is a seasoned financial executive. He has been with us for a number of years. He was the CFO for us in our P-Sol business, CFO in our USIS business he has been CFO for 20 years, he is a CFA Chartered Holder, he has been with First Data, BellSouth, AT&T, holds an undergraduate degree from Virginia and a MBA from Georgia Tech. And I'm convinced this will be a very smooth transition for us. With that, thank you Jeff for your 25 years and again plenty of time to celebrate and Doug welcome to board. With that operator, we'll turn it over for any questions that guys in the call might have. Operator : Thanks. [Operator Instructions]. We will take the first question from Gary Bisbee from RBC. Gary Bisbee : Hi good morning and congratulations on a strong quarter. I appreciate all the color on mortgage, I guess can you give a little more color on what the drag is at the Workforce Solutions business and I guess as part of that the growth you're projecting continues to be incredibly strong. What are some of the areas that are -- mostly to be accelerating or just really driving strong growth to offset what should be much weaker mortgage volumes over the course of the year? Thank you. Rick Smith : Yes, thanks Gary. I will take a crack at that, this is Rick and John will jump on the same, first my comments. Overall for company I think we discussed three points of headwind and from mortgage and a little bit more headwind when you add in Workforce Solutions. We don't break out exact headwind for EWS versus USIS; you've got enough data I think you can break that down for a pretty good estimate. But mortgage is a very important part of Verification Services and has been an important part of all EWS. The components that give us confidence in our ability to offset was the same thing renewal for 11 years and I gave some color, Gary our pipeline -- our success of NPI last year was unbelievably strong and we expect the revenue in third year to be five times our revenue was in 2014, so that's unbelievable. So we just want very comprehensive review with Greg Locker and his team working for pipeline of products 2017 and 106 of breadth and depth, quality of those products in the pipeline are unbelievable. We will not launch all 106 but the number of products we're going to launch or confident in launching in again 2017 which is income or revenue are fabulous. Number two the enterprise growth initiative process we've been at now for wherever it's been seven years or so is we'll have a record year, I said that in my comments in 2016 which positions us very well for 2017. With all the core things that we have been -- the team has been delivering for our customers now for seven to 10 years. John Gamble : EDS -- EWS performance in the fourth quarter as you know it's outstanding right, so again north of 20% growth, so we are not really seeing a slowdown in the performance, all you are seeing as Rick mentioned is you will see an impact from mortgage next year and then some of the growth that was contributed in 2016 from ACA we just don't see repeat. But the rest of the businesses are growing very, very well. Rick Smith : Gary one last thing, one final color might be that another contributor to incremental growth in 2017 is going to be slightly improving economies in some major places which we operate in U.S. will be modestly better in our opinion, UK will be modestly better for the full-year and Spain will be modestly better, I mentioned this before Argentina we are confident Argentina will have a GDP perspective most better year and 2017 versus 2016. So again global so modest global economic health and 80-plus-percent of all the revenues is non-mortgage we have did 15%, 17% mortgage closed. So on economies tend to grow that tends to help our core business. Gary Bisbee : Great, thanks. And then just one quick follow-up, you mentioned this digital marketing opportunity in a Silicon Valley company. Could you help us understand what exactly that opportunity is what you are providing and should we think this is more of a one-off or the beginning of what you see is it incremental new opportunity? Rick Smith : It's just short I will give Gary; it's a world-class so nothing sourced [ph] in any. You can think from our digital marketing companies in Silicon Valley and we have partnered with, it's a great revenue generator for us this year. More importantly than that it is giving us a market credibility in the digital marketing space by leading -- by working with and building products and solving solutions for world-class digital marketing company and we will leave it at that think of it as an on trade sales force. Operator : We will take the next question from David Togut from Evercore ISI. David Togut : Good morning and thanks for everything over the years Jeff. Jeff Dodge : Yes Dave, thank you. You are welcome. Rick Smith : You're welcome. David Togut : Rick I appreciate you calling out the expected headwind from mortgage for 2017 putting some numbers around it. I noted that you grew 25% in mortgage in the fourth quarter despite the NBIA being up only 1%, so in that 3% headwind you are calling out, are you sort of baking in a very significant impact from mortgage in line with the NBIA outlook or you incorporating some continued expectation that you would likely significantly outgrow the mortgage market as you have in the past? Rick Smith : Great question, David. So the commentary on the guidance was for mortgage market to be down 15% and equates three points of headwind for us. Our expectation as you kind of noted there is to continue to innovate and gain share build new products and grow at much faster rate in the market or in this case decline at a much slower rate than the mortgage decline. David Togut : Got it. And then just as a follow-up, if you could talk about some of the other big drivers of consumer credit reporting demand for 2017 for example, auto, credit card, what is your outlook for those? Rick Smith : Yes, for us if you think about the enterprise channel what we use we will take all of our products in EWS products and credit products, we are expecting automotive to be as a market relatively flat with 2016, we expect credit card issues to be up, we expect mortgage to be down. Then when you look at other markets, home equity lending to be up on the mortgage side, it's tale of two stories refinancing will be extremely negative make sure it's the exact number but home sales is expected to be up and then when you think about businesses in that environment, you think about EWS and even though automotive is a marketplace is expected to be flat, we expect significant growth in EWS because we are widely penetrated. We talked about Pfizer partnership which gives us platform to fully distribute our products to them. So we've got improving markets in some cases, stable markets in others, and declining others in aggregate that's why we get the kind of forecast we gave you for USIS but also continued strong growth in EWS because of market penetration I think is still significant. David Togut : Understood, thanks. Nice to see the 18% dividend increase. Rick Smith : Thank you. Operator : We will now take the next question from Brett Huff from Stephens. Please go ahead. Brett Huff : Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Two quick ones. One of the things that I think folks always try and contemplate with your guidance is how conservative is it how comfortable do you feel with that is often you sort of raise that guidance through the year, given that you sort of accommodated this 3% headwind that you originally didn't, can you comment on how much comfort do you have with that achievability or conservatism in that guidance? Rick Smith : Brett, this is Rick. We take obviously as most companies do, the framework of guidance extremely service label to all parts of business John and I and many others from the company and we go into a period like this on a quarterly basis with updated guidance with those all the facts we possibly have at our fingertips and we give guidance following any unforeseen macro changes we cannot expect to follow through may be but we give guidance we think we are very likely to attain. So we try to say actually it's structuring a plan that if we tell you we're going to deliver $3.375 billion to $3.425 billion, we're going to hit that number. So I wouldn't call it conservative, I just call it, it's balanced and it's based on all the facts I hope it's done. Brett Huff : Okay, thanks. And then you talked a little bit about qualitatively some of the new products that you have been working on including TDX or the new project some things like that and you said they are going to be good in 2017, is there any qualitative measure that you can start putting around those four so we just get lot of questions from investors on that? Rick Smith : Let me give you a response and John will jump in. The qualitative framework we are talking to investors about our ability to continue to grow with two segments so on and so forth is again the product class of 53 months last year is the strongest class we have had ever. We expected revenue five times in 2014 combine that with EGI continue to outperform and that bodes well for 2017 that's the enterprise focus its breadth and allows to budget pipeline of 106 new products in the front-end for this year. So those are all the qualitative things that I talked about that we are doing -- have been doing for quite some time on innovation. Brett Huff : Okay. And then just one last question anything in the guidance from the change in the stock-based comp accounting rules? John Gamble : Yes, so we have assumed that we are going to remove that from our non-GAAP reporting. So we will just exclude that, since it will be very difficult for us to forecast the impact of any given quarter, our current thinking is we will exclude that. To the extent there becomes a trend in either direction that makes us have to revisit that decision, we certainly can but our guidance assumes that it will be excluded. Brett Huff : Okay. So it's an apples-to-apples to 2016? John Gamble : Absolutely, yes. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Ramsey El-Assal from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ramsey El-Assal: Thanks guys. Your ability to offset these mortgage headwind speaks to some resiliency in the model obviously, can you speak to the degree to which changes in your mix or diversification over the past two years have changed your overall sort of macro cyclical sensitivity. I think that's been an ongoing trend but this -- does this represent some kind of an inflection point in that direction? Rick Smith : Yes great question. I think Ramsey the change really started strategically and then exactly from an execution perspective 10 years ago when we made the decision to pivot from being solely dependent on credit based data assets and largely U.S. geographic exposure to a units assets company with more geographic focus in just in U.S. and secondarily when we have the technology platforms invested in data assets or ability to build products and innovate and where you see that we have never done before, you navigate changes in macroeconomic environment that we couldn't do before. As you know, that process takes time we launched with the acquisition of TALX and NPI back in 2007 we gained momentum that we had a recession and we come out of the recession with this great robust processing capability and we continue to add the data assets and done nothing but mature, mature, mature get better every year, talk about the NPI 2.0 we launched with [indiscernible] we've got to reinvent and reinvigorate innovation that's paying great dividend, I should say. Ramsey El-Assal: That makes a lot of sense. I mean given sounds like your guidance obviously your 2017 guidance would have been 3% higher without mortgage in ACA. And it doesn't really sound like you had to put any emergency plans into effect, it seems like a lot of the stuff was in the pipeline already. I mean is the implication of your long-term guidance is getting to be a little bit too conservative for those factors? Rick Smith : I don't know, I think about 118-year-old company growing top-line and bottom-line and NPI and EBITDA margin that has been certainly conservative. I think it's something we are very proud of. That to your point there are no emergency plans that have been pulled off the shelf it's just that one thing it'll reflect back upon the quality of the solutions we developed last year in NPI and you had the hindsight of pretty similar months of visibility that was just stronger than we expected then. Ramsey El-Assal: Got it and thanks so much. John Gamble : To be specific in our long-term model we are not envisioning change in the long-term model. Ramsey El-Assal: Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : We'll now take the next question from Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs. Andre Benjamin : Thanks good morning. I know you guys have talked a bit about the use of trended data potentially going to other loan categories besides mortgages. I was wondering any color you can give on how those conversations are going about the tradeoff between cost and incremental lift to some of those categories and how are you thinking about making it more cost effective for say lower dollar value categories like credit cards. Rick Smith : Yes I think Andre we are making great progress like I mentioned in my prepared comments that we are not looking Cambrian gives us great ability to use all of our data assets we never could before. And this will be a needle where we are going to take all of our data assets and use to our company, putting in Cambrian turned about 72 months in some cases actually application value will be determined on the ROI if the customer gets them. I mentioned one more seems to be very helpful is automotive. Obviously we are doing mortgage undoubtedly another top routinely about you need to get to a point that no longer talking at 5,000 foot level at an industry about where you trended, you go to look at what type of data are you trending, how long are you trending it, what vertical you are looking at, what geography and what vertical and which sub-vertical and vertical, so is the automotive improved, sometime with the list you get there and then hence with those value, you can determine the price. We've made great progress there and we'll continue to make very good progress. I'm confident over the prior year, we have earnings calls update we will continue to have visibilities throughout this. Next step is the on payment. Andre Benjamin : And then just one follow-up on Personal Solutions, I know you said you expect the growth there to remain above your long-term trend it is definite in the case over the last couple of years. Any color you can provide on how you expect the growth for the direct versus indirect channel? Rick Smith : Obviously the indirect channel has been and will be a greater revenue contributor. But we expect growth out of both and we expect growth globally, not just in the U.S. and I think one of things you can't underestimate is the multi-year journey that that business has been on to build, launch, and work globally, we in fact we call it Renaissance it's our platform and the goal that gives you on the direct side to build, modify, launch, create products much faster than we ever did before, create a user interface that is much more friendly not knowing to do in the past as well. So that would be a great enabler for growth for those guys. Operator : We will take the next question from Tim McHugh from William Blair. Tim McHugh : Hi guys, thanks. Just can you elaborate on the trends you're seeing in Europe, the growth continues to be incredibly strong I know, you talked about the TDX contract? But I mean this is more than that, so I mean can you talk about bit more about what's driving the strength there and connect, can you determine? Rick Smith : Yes, I think strategically, Tim, it's the same that goes to the world, you are saying that the ballpark in EDI and EPI. So the core processes we will use to grow around the world it's on Europe. In addition to those core processes, yes you do have the industrial contract, TDX contract and you know TDX is not just in the UK, TDX is now part of our debt management strategy globally but is revenue being generated beyond just investor or government contract in the UK. Beyond that as I mentioned in my comments we are seeing a modestly improving economic environment even with Brexit in the UK, we are seeing really good performance by our team and we are seeing that for years now, we continue to really good job and executing core growth in NPI and EGI. So it's broad based. Tim McHugh : Okay. Thanks and then international margins seems to be a big part of kind of the margin story as we think about at least above average sort of expansion for 2017? Is that just leverage on growth, is there something is it savings from some of the realignments that you have done there and then implication of Cambrian, I guess what is -- what is it that's driving a little faster expansion now as we go into 2017? Rick Smith : Great question. One we did great framework, the commitment we have given you our investors and ourselves is to continue to drive EBITDA margin up to that 40% range, approximately 40% once we've carried around including international. International by default is less efficient in where they operate in a USIS or a EWS is because so many geographies. So you continue to see us through couple of things. We took after reposition the business to take inefficiencies out and we've done a lot of that and we've not slightly short from on this earnings call to do just that. Number two for years now we have been at the standardization of technology platforms around the globe where you can transfer platforms from U.S. with one part of the world to another part of the world take cost out drive efficiency. So those are the two main things we have done and third if you do acquisitions over time those acquisitions become more efficient that will run and as the incremental margins. So those were and I think we guided long-term model for international in mid-30s and you are seeing a nice step up in 2016, you'll see another nice step in 2017. Operator : We will take the next question from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Toni Kaplan : Congratulations on the strong quarter guys and Jeff congratulations on your pending retirement. Rick I think you mentioned you expect margins will expand at least 100 basis points in 2017, which is obviously, well in excess of the 25 basis point annual target you've talked about in the past. As you think about our models in 2018 and beyond, I'm wondering if 25 basis points is still sort of the right number and then I have a follow-up. Rick Smith : Again our goal is to exclude, as you know is to manage levels of investment to give us the growth rate that we, we want to customers desire the price we need to build to satisfy the problems with maximizing margin and the model we have a 7% to 10% growth, 11% to 14% multiple year -- 11% to 14% EPS growth and at least 25% margin expansion. We have a goal to get the 40% margin. There you see years like you saw last year we get 110% you can see years like you see this year we're guided over 100 basis points again and you'll see years we're down 25 basis points. So just think of the long-term model growth on revenue growth on EPS and getting to that 40% margin. Toni Kaplan : Got it. That makes sense. And just sort of as a follow-up I wanted to ask about Global Consumer Solutions margins which were up obviously very nicely compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 is there anything to call out there that was sort of one-time high margin revenue or anything else that might be driving that. John Gamble : No I think the fourth quarter that the investment and marketing was a little lower than normal. Actually you're seeing margins a little higher than you would normally see. And then if you remember, earlier in the year they had quite a bit of expense to board a new major customer LifeLock and that was pretty much completed by the time you got to the fourth quarter. So you put those two things together and our margins look a little better. That's why we indicated we expect next year's margins to be slightly over 30%, but on average that's where they played out this year, we would expect the same type of thing to play out in 2017. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Manav Patnaik : Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. Rick you said a lot of great things in the core and then you left the worst to the last announcing Jeff retirements so you could done the first way you thought. Congratulates -- congratulations and thank you, Jeff. So I hope we would still have some more time with you. My first question is just in the offset to be 3% headwind that you're seeing. I understand it's obviously a clear testament to your NPI initiatives, EGI and so forth but in terms of the components that offset was there -- did you have to pivot into different products and areas that maybe work better in a rising rate environment or is that how we should think of it or was it something that you sort of already had in your armory and you just sort of using it now. Rick Smith : Yes, it's more the latter in pivoting on product innovation is always speed but you can just quickly change it is a pipeline that's been developed for quite some time and really what happened look Manav, is we gave guidance, sort of framework, you shouldn't call guidance in October and that was a value of the time looking back in February, number of prices launched already are out that are being used are at a one rate far higher than we had thought, we could achieve at that point in time. So it's really more the latter rather than pivot to say it was launched our products do well high in share development. Manav Patnaik : Got it. And then in Workforce I think you said you guys are launching in Canada. I guess what I'm trying to just understand is, how we should think about the timeline on how that plays out? Rick Smith : Yes, I think, yes, be patient with us. We have the ability to make multiple -- multiple investments for the long-term benefit of our shareholders and customers. I think its international number of Canada, UK, Australia, some places. Latin America has been a longer-term Vietnam versus a 2017. These are working really hard you will see, have seen peel back some margin and look at the assets an example, we invested nicely in the fourth quarter we will continue to invest in 2017 and standing up capabilities for the international were number. And we can do that by the way, we can do that, what you guys do, you'll have to still hit we're committed year over at a more to mid-50s kind of EBITDA margin for EWS. But think about being revenue being generated international numbers being kind of 2018, 2019 timeframe. John Gamble : In terms of your concerns about Jeff Dodge, let me hear from your end, you can do a farewell super. You'll have an opportunity to see him again don't worry. Jeff Dodge : That's okay. I think it's going to be a revenue generator. Manav Patnaik : Last question for me was just around M&A pipeline. You've obviously got your leverage bring down you're pretty close to getting to your official target. How should we think about -- what's in the cart there especially may be you talked about Brazil, getting better. Does that increase your attractiveness there? Rick Smith : Yes. Thank you. Goal number one we make sure that the Asian experienced Veda was integrated properly and we're getting the resources they need long-term to grow. As I mentioned in my prepared comments that is going to extremely well I see as being behind us now. So just to be on sure we're delevering as you mentioned before we got a clear strategy. We got a solid pipeline, we got a balance sheet to do acquisitions and you should expect us to think about getting back in the market of M&A. Operator : We'll now take the next question from Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust. Andrew Jeffrey : Hey good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Very thorough job as usual Rick, the comments on data and in particular are pretty encouraging. I'm wondering if you could frame up a little bit what the internal growth rate is there and how much that might be contributing to the 2017 organic growth as that business anniversaries. Rick Smith : Yes, I think we bought the company we bought it because it was a great franchise, it was a great cash, there is a geographical expansion in the area we like a lot. But the gross rate as we stand up would about be the rate of internationals [indiscernible] growth rate so. When you think about the organic growth of Equifax think of Veda bringing us in a range we're taking for a company. Andrew Jeffrey : Okay. So neutral to the consolidate company outlook? Rick Smith : Yes. Andrew Jeffrey : And I assume that some of the efforts Cambrian and EGIS et cetera are poised at some point to accelerate that growth? Rick Smith : Yes, we're ahead of schedule in deployment of platforms as you know it's taking time to contraction we get customers that from to get technology in place through could be a adoption of the customers. And the hope would be over multiple years in the future that those are enablers with different areas of growth which is facilitating potentially in faster growth. Andrew Jeffrey : Okay. And to the extent just kind of looking forward and thinking about this remarkable ability to offset a three PPT headwind if we think two kind of worst-case scenarios if ACA is 2 to 2.5 point headwind in 2018 can we think about momentum from NPI the class of 2016, the classes, may be not 2017 quite yet, but those things potentially offsetting that the framework of your long-term growth targets. John Gamble : That\u2019s a goal. Our goal is to deliver over multiple years that 7% to 10% top-line growth and that's organic growth, that's the M&A and stay committed to that. So innovation big part of it, we are going up to 10 years and also thinking today and we'll know more -- you will know more and more as we go throughout the year. What does a repeat and replace really mean? And will that be means testing. Will it be a corporate mandate? We're just taking a look-alike and our goal is to make sure we're innovating this fact as we can today to navigate headwinds as we've just did in 2017 any new headwinds making up 2018. Operator : We'll now take the next question from Kevin McVeigh from Deutsche Bank. Kevin McVeigh : Great, thank you very much. And congratulations I wonder the new administration being so per growth as you think about growth opportunities obviously seeing being a potential headwind but there are other areas that could be sources of growth as the government tries to enhance economy beyond traditional GDP. And is there any sensitivity beyond that we've been in this less than optimal GDP environment to the extent we do get 3%. How does that impact the longer-term organic growth target? Rick Smith : Kevin may be three points; obviously strength in the overall economy is good for us. Our customer who go to faster rate that helps us do more. Number two, corporate tax reform, if corporate tax reform is passed in a comprehensive manner the ability to company generate more earnings and [indiscernible] best practice and that ability to grow, which will help us grow that's beneficial to us. Number three is if there is a meaningful change in the regulatory landscape that helps our customers, be able to attract more customers underwrite more products and expand those are three areas that all help us. John Gamble : Specific to us corporate tax reform we're likely on the good side of the ledger, positive. We have been specific about how much, and we'll have a way to wait to see what it looks like. But generally speaking, it would be a positive forever. Kevin McVeigh : Super. And then just a great boost to dividend in terms of 18% boost how do we think about that relative to buybacks. And then I know you mentioned buybacks potentially in the back half of the year is that already incorporated in the guidance or would that be a potential source outside. Rick Smith : Yes so, again as our leverage comes down we will execute buybacks based on the pace of our acquisitions. So I think we're extremely successful in acquisitions, you'll see a lower level of buybacks. But, yes, we've already assumed the level of repurchases in the second half of 2017 in our guidance. John Gamble : Kevin, you may recall, I can't years ago was the -- well, we committed to the dividend policy that was 25%, 35% of our adjusted net income, we go back every year in the form of the dividend, that is safe as far as some of that. Operator : We now take the next question from George Mihalos from Cowen. George Mihalos : Great, congrats on another nice quarter guys and Jeff congrats on your retirement, it sounds like we'll have a fair amount of time to tell about you, which is good. Rick and John I'm going to trying to ask this question a bit of another way but if we sort of look at 20% of your business between ACA and mortgage being down effectively double-digit. That means the other 80% to get to that 8% to 9% constant currency growth for the whole company that's up almost kind of in the mid-teens. And I'm just wondering if you might be order to rank order, what are some of those drivers whether it would be verticals or geographies that really stand out for you to give you that strong growth? Rick Smith : Let me see if I can deconstruct your view which is a good view as stated it is in the teams you also have not too much of Veda benefit in 2017 than you have in 2016 so that's part of the contributor. Then what you are saying is true, you have very high once again very high kind of organic non-mortgage, non-HCA growth and there is no magic there, George that is the same thing we've been doing in NPI and ETI. So it's truly is broad based and if I went through I can't remember that's an example I think I gave and even U.S. the number of verticals have grown double-digit, I can do the same thing in international, I pick different countries and different verticals of different countries, I can take that verticals in the USIS and see how they are growing. It is so broad based, it's not one vertical, it's not two verticals it's not one part, two part it's a combination of all those things coming together. John Gamble : And as Rick mentioned in his script we are seeing continued very strong double-digit growth out of EWS and then out of international and then GCS growing above their long-term model rate. So the areas of growth are really concentrated there. USIS still performing well relative to mortgage but the growth is concentrated in those businesses as we have talked about. George Mihalos : Okay great. If I could sneak one more in the financial marketing line, I mean that was up nicely, I think it was almost 7% in the quarter, should we be viewing that as a sign of your customers, your banks wanting to get more aggressive on the lending front? Rick Smith : Yes traditionally that has been the case but pre-screen is the pre-cursor to underwriting which that puts your online stuff. So we have not explicitly baked that into guidance, what we expect though rather than what pre-screen that was actually go more lending which is good for us. Operator : We now take the next question from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Andrew Steinerman : Hi it's Andrew, Rick, I just want to make sure I understand the 3% headwind that 3 percentage only from mortgage right and when you say the ACA being flat rev, that's in addition to the 3% headwind. And then on the offset are you saying that the increased revenue activity fully offset those headwinds or mostly offset those headwinds, I know you are counting on that activity from banks higher interest rate environment in addition to higher NPI? Rick Smith : Good point. So to answer your first question is ACA was not directly counted as percentage of mortgage headwind alone. We kind of say, [indiscernible] said what we knew you can do the math was a growth driver in the past; it was the growth driver to flat that is a headwind for us. The EWS has got to offset and we got to offset, thinking about the guidance that we gave you as being offset by things we are already doing, so it's a combination of NPI and EGI. Andrew Steinerman : Okay, thank you. Rick Smith : Thank you. One of the things may be before hopefully you guys starting to phone is I -- just I could just two points, came up with a few right of thought things that will probably be addressed. One was around the OIS revenue when compared to others we got 4% versus what you expected from your larger point of clarification you just made some you just is that was -- that is burdened by two points, there is two points, three points of headwind from what we call direct to consumer business. Now we credit GCS, you said most of our consumer business going [ph] with the GCS. We left behind reports month to [indiscernible] experience that has been declining, that declined even faster in the fourth quarter, we've heard experience announced that reach last year in the fourth quarter and then repeat. So that three points headwind this year versus less that one in the first few quarters of the year. The other question was raised sequential margin change in EWS. I will just quickly talk about that. That was driven by two things. We got to see now total cost with mix we're still lower in the high margin from [indiscernible] you may have seen in the third quarter. Secondly as I mentioned and John mentioned we are investing nicely in setting up the international. So those are two small points that are sequentially looking to margin, EWS explain that, that business is still well and trading at 50 and mid-50s margin, so I can clarify that one. Jeff you want to finish on just talking about that is that. Jeff Dodge : I want to thank everybody for their interest and their time in Equifax and I've got a lot of time and job and you've all been a big part of that, we will get to meet again in the coming months. We also wanted to thank Rick and John for giving me the latitude and the support to do a job I enjoy and once again I want to thank everybody and with that operator, we will terminate the call. Operator : Thank you. That will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, ladies and gentlemen. You may now disconnect.",

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Dodge. Please go ahead, Sir. Jeff Dodge : Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Jeff Dodge, Investor Relations; and with me today are Rick Smith, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section of the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com. During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2016 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. Also, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA margin, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance. For the first quarter of 2017, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes the acquisition-related amortization expense, the transaction and integration expenses associated with our acquisition of Veda, the income tax effects of stock awards recognized upon vesting or settlement and adjustments resulting from the conclusion of tax audits. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as net income attributable to Equifax, adding back income tax expense, interest expense, net of interest income, depreciation, amortization and the onetime impact of certain transaction and integration expenses associated with our acquisition of Veda. These non-GAAP financial measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our website. Please refer to our various investor presentations, which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website for further details. Now I'd like to turn it over to Rick. Rick Smith : Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. As always, thanks for joining us on this call. Comes off of a really strong start in '17. A solid first quarter performance across every business unit, every vertical in different geographies around the world. Once again, the growth that the team has delivered was very broad-based. We entered 2017 with great momentum than 2016, which I think you'll agree was a record year on so many fronts, including new product innovation and the international expansion with our acquisition of Veda last year. The management team is building on the momentum from 2016 with each of our business units and COEs executing at a high level. Total revenue for the quarter was $832 million, up 14% on a reported basis and up 15% on local-currency basis in the first quarter of 2016. For the quarter, FX created $8 million of year-over-year headwind. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 36%, up a solid 180 basis points from a year ago, well above the guidance we provided for the quarter and for the year. Adjusted EPS was $1.44, up 17% and now I'll jump into individual BUs as I typically do. I'll start with USIS. They delivered a solid 5% revenue growth in the quarter driven by mortgage, new product innovation and enterprise growth initiatives. In the quarter, USIS had strong double-digit growth across the mortgage, government and communications verticals and high single-digit growth in several areas, including Prescreen and Identity and Fraud Solutions. But much of this growth is supported by continued strong growth in our enterprise and alliance channels. USIS delivered this growth in the quarter despite a drag from DTC resettle revenues of 1.4 percentage points. You remember, we've talked about that before. That's a piece of DTC that's not in GCS, it resides in USIS. EBITDA margins remained very strong at 48.6%. Last several quarters, we've discussed the outstanding progress the teams have made with our Cambrian data and analytics platform and the opportunity to help our customers launch products and solutions with greater speed and insights. This quarter, we announced Equifax Ignite, a portfolio of data and analytic capabilities and solutions for customers powered by Cambrian, which we've talked about for quite some time. It is a best-in-class solution that leverages our very unique data assets. Ignite offers our customers a breadth of tailored approach delivered in a very smart and user-friendly manner to fuel our customers' growth with expanded insights. Our go-to-market portfolio for Ignite includes Cambrian direct, which is direct access to our high-speed analytical environment for a rapid model and score development and Cambrian marketplace, which is a user configurable app that deliver actual insights for easy consumption, typically by a -- the business usual or analyst versus the data scientists, be more likely to use Cambrian Direct. This comprehensive approach allows us to meet both the needs of the traditional user as well as our customers' analytical experts who will have the ability to combine Equifax data with customer data and third-party data to build custom solutions -- the custom models and solutions to solve problems in a new and innovative ways. While it is early, we see tremendous potential with Ignite, which has the flexibility and analytical tools to meet multiple market needs. In first quarter, we launched our InstaTouch mobile solution, including -- with a major financial partner. InstaTouch provides a simple way for personal identity information to be securely pre-populated into an application, helping to improve the conversion and reduce fallout -- application fallout, which is typically caused by friction. We believe this product capability has applications for both customers, as well as Global Consumer Solutions and our other consumers support operations around the globe. NPI, New Product Innovation, will continue to be a powerful driver for USIS as a future growth. We see great opportunities for USIS/NPI efforts in 2017 and 2018 in fraud, digital media, mobile and auto. Trended data mortgage was a big driver of NPI and USIS in 2016, and we'll continue to realize benefits in 2017. We continue to make good progress on our enterprise growth initiative to determine the benefit of trended data as well as our machine learning capabilities. And this focus is across all major verticals, as we've talked about in the past. We expect to complete this analysis in 2017 and believe it'll be significant opportunities for trended data beyond mortgage in areas such as auto, home equity and card. Although this will drive revenue growth over the longer term, trended data outside of mortgage we're not assuming will be a big driver for NPI revenue in 2017. An important driver for future growth is our enterprise vertical alliance strategy. Across USIS and Workforce Solutions, we continue to strengthen our sales and marketing efforts, as well as integrated delivery capabilities in our verticals, including mortgage, auto, government and communications. This will further differentiate the competitive advantage of our integrated income, credit and analytics offering. Our enterprise alliance strategy, which for us includes partnerships with other leading data and analytics companies, as well as other reseller and connected partners, continues to deliver substantial growth. As we continue to rapidly expand the credit, fraud and income-related data and analytics assets we share with partners, we expect this to be a continuing growth driver throughout 2017 and beyond. International. International delivered an impressive quarter with strong revenue growth and margin expansion. It delivered 41% local-currency revenue growth. Excluding Veda, growth was 14%. Additionally, adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by an impressive 590 basis points. International continues to make great progress on their strategic initiatives, leveraging NPI and EGI to drive growth and they also executing Lean initiatives and the regional strategies to drive operational efficiencies. That's really fueling that 590-basis-point margin expansion we just talked about. It's now just over a year since we closed Veda. In this quarter, we rebranded Veda to Equifax. Integration process has been outstanding, with the team executing at a high level on all the more important initiatives. We're also on track to deploy our global platforms in Australia and New Zealand, including Cambrian and fraud over the next few quarters. Our management disciplines, such as NPI and Lean, our global technology capabilities are being rapidly adopted and are adding to the strength of a business that was already operating at a very high level. We now have a very strong presence in management infrastructure in that region as we look forward to opportunities for future growth and expansion. Europe performed really well in the quarter with 15% local currency revenue growth, driven by growth in Spain and our U.K. debt management business. The debt management business in the U.K. continues to be a growth driver and is off to a very strong start in 2017. The U.K. government remains committed to growing the business with us. We are now working with 8 different government agencies with the addition of the government's child maintenance group. The total debt placed from the program to date is now up to GBP 2.9 billion and our collection performance with analytics continues to be strong. Latin America had an impressive quarter with 20% local currency revenue growth. We just returned from a trip to Latin America and spent time with our management team there. Our customers, government officials, economists and some of the very top business leaders in the region. There are a number positive trends on the economic front across those regions and within our business. Governments there are increasingly focused on financial inclusion. Financial institutions are aggressively looking for new customers and are in need of scoring models and unique data to make their decisions. We continue to expand our technology capabilities in the region, and in 2017 we expect to deploy Cambrian in Argentina. We're optimistic about the economic outlook as well as our performance across the region, particularly in Argentina, Chile and Peru. Canada had an outstanding quarter, our local currency growth exceeding 10%. The team continues to execute on several key initiatives, including new products, debt management, trended data and Cambrian, which we launched in Canada last quarter. Workforce Solutions delivered an outstanding performance of 11% revenue growth in the quarter and expansion of EBITDA margins up to 50.2%, up 70 basis points from a year ago. Verifier grew a very strong 16% in the quarter. We saw the highest growth rates in card, consumer finance, government and auto with continued strong growth also in mortgage and preemployment. In Verification Services, the team created another innovative solution, the consumer employment and income report. This report augments employment and income verification data with credit data from the credit reporting database and other unique data assets to help our clients meet their specific verification needs. This new report can be tailored to any vertical and/or specific need of the verifier. This is just one example of how we're leveraging our differentiated data assets across the business and combine them with our technological capabilities to deliver high-value insights and solutions to our customers. That was launched in the second quarter -- or in the first quarter and should be a revenue contribute for us throughout the balance of the year. In Employer Services this quarter, we launched a fully automated wage audit compliant solution, which relieves the growing burden employers face to fulfill state mandates for wage and employment data used to detect unemployment benefit over payments and fraud. We continue to help our employers with innovative compliance solutions like this that are contemporary to our existing offerings -- top measures for our existing offerings in unfunded claims and other areas. This also positions us to provide these employers a way to seamlessly contribute their data to the Work Number database. Workforce Solutions is leading the way for enterprise-wide government vertical. Expanding and growing this vertical is a key enterprise growth initiative. Team has had several wins in the quarter. The pipeline of opportunities is strong, and the results are nicely ahead of our expectations. We also continue to make good progress towards launching a Verification Services business in Canada, and we're in discussions with several partners that will accelerate the record acquisitions. And to date, the number of records we've had at the data base are nicely ahead of our expectations. Global Consumer Solutions reported 13% local currency revenue growth and expanded EBITDA margins by 90 basis points in the first quarter. GCS continues to focus on expanding the consumer channels they serve, in addition to continuing to expand our relationship with direct to consumer partners like Credit Karma, LifeLock and ClearScore of U.K. We're also expanding other indirect channels, including expanded solution and offerings in the breach, remediation, tax-return, fraud and broadening white label channels. Working with our key direct-to-consumer and indirect partners, we continue to expand these relationships into Canada and the U.K. as well as looking at other markets around the world. As I usually do, before I hand it over to John for the detailed financials, let me make a few comments on a few of our enterprise-wide -- company-wide initiatives. Let me start with enterprise growth initiatives, and again, it's an NPI. Enterprise growth initiatives are fundamental drivers to our -- both revenue growth and global process and technology transformation across the company. This year, we had 15 EGIs designed to drive revenue growth and create long term value. Year-to-date, these initiatives are running nicely ahead of last year. We're making very good progress on several EGIs focused on transformation -- transformational initiatives, including global deployment of Cambrian and insights activation through Ignite Direct and Ignite marketplace. We'll talk about that maybe more in the Q&A. New Product Innovation, or NPI as we call it, continues to be a driver of both near term and longer-term revenue. Through March, revenue from these initiatives is running 20% ahead of expectations. Our vitality Index is up from last year and a number of new products in our pipeline is even greater in 2016 pipeline. And as a reminder, as we've discussed before, 2016 was our strongest NPI class since we launched it back in 2007. We're driving toward another very strong year in our Lean initiatives, with over 400 initiatives to drive revenue and profit around the world. In the first quarter, our Lean initiatives exceeded the targets by more than 15%, and we expect continued strong execution in 2017 across broad portfolio initiatives. Our customer Lean activities also continue to deliver increased value and strengthen our relationships with our customers around the world. The innovations that the teams continue to deliver, I believe, are truly market-leading. We hold the most unique data in the industry and add value to our data through our leading-edge analytics and technology. This unparalleled combination provides the knowledge that enables our customers to make even better critical decisions. To reflect this vision, we recently introduced our new corporate tagline : Powering the world with knowledge. This renews our promise to deliver powerful and actionable insights to our customers throughout the world. Executing on that vision will deliver meaningful results for our customers and our shareholders in the quarters and years to come. We're off to a strong start this year and continue to have a clear path to deliver on the guidance we provided for 2017. Team is energized about the strategic initiatives we've made around the world in data assets, technology and talent to power that growth. And with that, let me turn it over to John for the financials and I'll come back with some closing comments on the quarter and some color for the full year. John Gamble : Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As before, I'll generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis. As Rick discussed, in 1Q '17, we performed ahead of our expectations, putting us nicely on the path for 2017. The mortgage in ACA headwinds we discussed in our February earnings call impacted us, as expected, in USIS and Workforce Solutions. USIS revenue in 1Q '17 was $310 million, up over 5% when compared to the first quarter of 2016 and consistent with our expectations. Online Information Solutions revenue was $225 million, up 3% when compared to the year-ago period. Online Information Solutions revenue was driven by growth in mortgage, telco, government and fraud. USIS direct to consumer revenue, principally our revenue with other CRAs, declined in the quarter, negatively impacting 1Q '17 Online Information Solutions and total USIS revenue growth by approximately 1.9 and 1.4 percentage points respectively. Our commercial rich related revenues, which are also included in OIS, were also down in the quarter. Total mortgage-related revenue for USIS was up 27%. Total mortgage-related revenue for Equifax, including Workforce Solutions mortgage revenue, was up 22%. Mortgage Solutions revenue and USIS was $39 million, up 22% year-to-year. In 1Q '17, mortgage market volumes were generally in line with our expectations. Our revenue performance was much stronger than the market, reflecting trended data, as well as new products and further market penetration. In 2Q '17, we expect mortgage market volumes to be down mid-single digits year-to-year. Compared to 1Q '17, this creates a drag on total Equifax 2Q '17 organic growth of over 1%. For all of 2017, we continue to expect mortgage market volumes to be down about 15%, and we expect continued over-performance versus the market. Financial Marketing Services revenue was $46 million in 1Q '17, up 2%. The adjusted EBITDA margin for USIS was a very strong 48.6%, about flat with last year. For 2Q '17, we expect to see acceleration in USIS total revenue growth rate, despite the expected weaker mortgage market, as other areas within USIS strengthen in 2Q. For all of 2017, we continue to expect USIS to show revenue growth slightly below their long-term range of 5% to 7%, reflecting the expected 15% decline in overall mortgage market volumes for the full year, as well as approximately 1% of headwind for the full year from our direct-to-consumer revenues. We expect -- we continue to expect USIS to modestly expand EBITDA margins versus 2016 levels for the full year. Workforce Solutions revenue was $200 million in the quarter, up 11% when compared to 1Q 2016. Verification Services delivered revenue of $115 million, up 16%. Growth was broad-based with double-digit growth across many verticals, including auto, card, consumer finance and government. Employer Services revenue of $85 million was up 5% from last year. Our on-boarding products grew nicely, along with continued growth in our Workforce Analytics business, which benefited from employers completing tax reporting for 1095s and 1094s earlier than in 2016. Workforce Solutions growth at 11% was strong in the quarter and consistent with our expectations. Growth was impacted by the headwinds and mortgage and ACA, which we discussed in February. Compared to overall 2016 growth rates, industry mortgage volumes and the slowdown in ACA revenue account for approximately 2/3 of the change in growth. The remaining 1/3 reflects timing in our work opportunity tax credits revenues. We continue to expect, as we indicated in February, that total ACA-related revenue for 2017 will be about flat versus 2016. ACA-related revenue, as expected, showed growth in 1Q '17 as 2016 tax reporting was completed. ACA-related revenue in 2Q '17 and the remainder of 2017 is expected to decline, reflecting uncertainty regarding the structure of the federal healthcare program going forward. The Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margin was a very strong 50.2% in 1Q '17, up from 49.5% in 1Q '16. For all of 2017, we expect Workforce Solutions to show revenue growth at or above the high end of their long term 9% to 11% range, despite the expected 15% decline in the overall mortgage market and the uncertainty regarding ACA. We continue to expect Workforce Solutions to expand EBITDA margins versus 2016 levels for the full year. International revenue was $260 million in 1Q '17, up 37% on a reported basis and up 41% on a local-currency basis. Constant currency growth, excluding Veda, was very strong and above our expectations at 14%. By region, Europe's revenue was $62 million in 1Q '17, up 2% in U.S. dollars and 15% in local currency. As Rick mentioned earlier, the U.K. debt management business continues to be a growth driver, and Spain also delivered double-digit growth in the quarter. Latin America's revenue was $51 million in 1Q '17, up 20% in U.S. dollars and up 20% local currency. Revenue growth was broad-based with strong double-digit local currency growth in Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Central America. Canada's revenue was $31 million, up 15% U.S. dollars and 11% in local currency. This continues the trend of improving growth in Canada, reflecting the strengthening of their NPI funnel. International's adjusted EBITDA margin was 31.2% in 1Q '17, up from 25.3% a year ago. We saw strong EBITDA margin across Latin America and Europe with Canada continuing to deliver the strongest EBITDA margins in the segment. International is also seeing the benefits of their restructuring programs, which began in 4Q '16 and their ongoing regionalization efforts. 1Q '17 is also benefited by having Veda for the entire quarter. For the remaining quarters of 2017, we continue to expect strong year-over-year EBITDA margin expansion in International, but to a lesser degree than will be realized in the first quarter. For all of 2017, we expect revenue growth for International to be above their long term 8% to 10% range and above our previous expectations. We also continue to expect EBITDA margins to be nicely above 30% for all of 2017. Global Consumer Solutions revenue at $106 million was stronger-than-expected in 1Q '17, up 11% on a reported basis and up 13% on a local-currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 31.7% in 1Q '17. The consumer direct business executed through both equifax.com and our white label properties was slightly weaker than we had expected. We did see growth in our broader indirect channels, which Rick referenced earlier. Our reseller business delivered revenue growth of over 25%, much stronger than we had expected. As you remember, in 2Q '16, GCS in total showed very strong 22% growth with our indirect and reseller businesses up over 70%, as we added a new partner in 1Q '16. As we discussed at the time, revenue in 2Q '16 was particularly benefited as this new partner made an initial purchase of a substantial amount of tribe year credit data. In 2017, this purchase occurred in 1Q '17. Although it did not have a substantial impact on income, it did positively impact GCS Q1 revenue by over $5 million or more than 5 percentage points. Given the timing of this project, our 2Q '17 GCS revenue growth will be negatively impacted. For 2017, we expect GCS revenue to be in their long-term model of 5% to 8% revenue growth. We also expect first half '17 GCS revenue to be at or slightly below the end of the long-term range, with stronger growth in the second half. First half '17 reflects slightly weaker consumer direct in white label markets, as well as the anniversary of large direct to consumer reseller partner wins in early 2016. Growth accelerates in second half '17 as these partner relationships continue to expand and the indirect channel's growth accelerates. In the first quarter, general corporate expense was $63 million, excluding integration expenses associated with the deed acquisition general corporate expense was $61 million, up 3% year-to-year and consistent with expectations. For Equifax, adjusted EBITDA margin was 36% in 1Q '17, up a strong 180 basis points from 34.2% in 1Q '16. As we indicated on our February earnings call, we are excluding from our non-GAAP results the income tax effects of stock awards recognized upon vesting our settlement. Our GAAP effective tax rate of 20.6% includes a $14.9 million benefit from the income tax effect of stock awards, as well as the benefit from discrete items principally related to adjustments resulting from the conclusion of tax audits. Excluding these items, our 1Q '17 effective tax rate would have been approximately 32%. We continue to expect our full year 2017 non-GAAP effective tax rate to be consistent with our February guidance at approximately 32.5%. In 1Q '17, operating cash flow was $104 million and free cash flow was $53 million, both consistent with our expectations. We continue to expect strong growth in cash flow in 2017, relative to 2016. As we indicated was our expectation in February, 1Q '17 operating cash flow was down versus 1Q '16, principally reflecting working capital, including the Veda acquisition-related items, which positively impacted 1Q '16 working capital; increased employee variable and other compensation payments in 1Q '17 following our very strong performance in 2016; and changes in other assets, principally tax payments, timing and prepaids related to software investments. Capital spending incurred in the quarter was $40 million for 2017. We continue to expect capital spending to be approximately 6% of revenue. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $2.7 billion. We continued to reduce our leverage following the Veda acquisition, which is now at 2.26x EBITDA. Now let me turn it back to Rick. Rick Smith : Thanks, John. For the second quarter, we expect revenue to be between $857 million and $862 million, reflecting constant currency growth of 7% to 7.5%, partially offset by 1% of FX headwind. Guidance reflects the shift that John mentioned, of over $5 million in revenues in GCS that we previously expected to hit in the second quarter but delivered in the first quarter, and that negatively impacts the second quarter growth by approximately 0.7% of a percentage point. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.55 and $1.58, excluding a dollar -- $0.01 a share of negative FX. This reflects constant currency EPS growth of 10% to 12%. In the second quarter, our mortgage outlook for the market volumes is down mid-single digits. Compared to the first half of 2016, our outlook reflects first half constant currency revenues up 11% and first half adjusted EPS up 14%, well above our long-term model. Furthermore, our multi-year growth has been very strong, I think you'll agree, from a perspective compared to the first half of 2014. Our first half of 2017 outlook reflects compounded annual growth for revenues of 12% compound annual growth for adjusted EPS of 18% over that period of time. On to the full year. Our full year 2017 guidance for Equifax revenue and EPS are solid and are unchanged from our February call. As we discussed on this call, our 2017 revenue expectations for International has increased from our February earnings call. While our expectations for GCS revenue has moderated a bit, but still within their long-term trends. In total, we continue to expect Equifax revenue for the year to be between $3.375 billion and $3.425 billion, again unchanged from our previous guidance. This reflects constant currency revenue growth of 8% to 9%, partially offset by 1% of FX headwind. Consistent with our February guidance, this assumes total mortgage volumes decline of approximately 15% in the year. We continue to expect adjusted EPS to be between $5.96 and $6.10, up 8% to 10% slightly -- excluding slightly over $0.02 per share of negative impact from FX. This is also unchanged from our previous guidance. We continue to expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to expand by a healthy 100 basis points for the full year. So, in summary. For USIS, our outlook is as previously expected and communicated during our February call. We expect that to be slightly below their long-term model of 5% to 7% revenue growth with mortgage headwinds impacting them by approximately 4 points for the year, mostly concentrated in the second half of 2017. For Workforce Solutions, our outlook is also as previously expected. We expect them to be at or above their long-term model of 9% to 11% revenue growth, again, despite 4 percentage points of mortgage headwind. Again, mostly concentrated in the second half of the year. So, outstanding performance in both those business. For GCS, we expect them to be within our long-term model we've communicated to you a 5% to 8% for the year. For International, our outlook is better than previously expected and above their long-term model of 8% to 10% growth. And for Equifax's total, again despite approximately 3 percentage points of mortgage headwinds and some additional headwinds from ACA at the company level, we expect to remain -- we expect that we remain confident in our full year outlook with constant currency revenue growth of 8% to 9% for the year. Hopefully, that's helpful. With that, operator, we'd like to open up for any questions for John or I. Operator : Thank you. [Operator instructions] And we're going to take our first question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Manav Patnaik : Yes. Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. First, just a near-term question. In terms of the guidance you've given, even though there are a bunch of headwinds you called out in USIS, just curious why are there any particular products or pieces that gives you confidence that it still improves in the second half? Rick Smith : Manav, specific to the USIS business or in general terms? Manav Patnaik : Well, I guess general as well, but I think USIS to start off with maybe. Rick Smith : Yes, I'd say USIS is the microcosm of the entire confidence we have for the company, and that is the thing that you know so well that we've been doing now for 10-plus years. It's all the stuff we have in NPI. We've talked about the classifieds last year have been very strong, they're starting to ramp up, in fact the last part's 2017. In fact, USIS is NPI progress at the end of 2016 and in the starting of 2017 is as strong as it's ever been. So, specific to USIS is what that comp is, but also, they're leveraging the same things everyone else is leveraging, things like EGI. Over 15 EGIs, USIS participates in those as well. So, there's no magic. But one of the things I love to think about is sitting back here, talking to you guys back in fourth quarter pre-election, we gave a framework for 2017, which was, we thought robust, you thought robust and all of a sudden, the world changed with Trump's election. And we thought \"My God, the world will change and mortgage rates are going to go up, ACA is going to be repealed.\" And yet, because of the continuity of execution and consistency of our initiatives for the past 10 years, we're able to maintain that guidance this year. So, I'm as confident now and John is as confident now in USIS's ability to deliver those numbers and the company's ability to deliver those numbers, as I've ever been. Manav Patnaik : So basically, what you're saying is it's just a broad-based NPI through all those, but you have the visibility? Okay. And then just on a bigger picture, clearly, a lot of good things still going on in the company, sounds like we have been getting better. I'm just thinking more, given you've digested, well, somewhat digested Veda and it's going well, like how should we think about capital return at this point in time to balance between doing the strategic M&A versus picking the buybacks back up? Rick Smith : We're deleveraging as expected. We're thought to be getting our leverage back around 2.25. We'll be there as we exit the second quarter. At that point, John and I will look at both getting back into share repurchase, as well as getting back in M&A. So, everything is performing on track. In fact, then we'll be levering at slightly faster rates on than maybe what we've anticipated last year. John Gamble : Absolutely. And we don't feel any constraints with executing M&A. We're continuing to go as fast as we can, and we continue to think we have a nice pipeline, as we look at the rest of this year. Manav Patnaik : Okay. And then just last one. The commentary you made, I think you had expected that last quarter as well, in the improvement in Latin America. Can you maybe address your latest news on Brazil? John Gamble : I was just down there, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, in South America. And what we always do is meet with business leaders and meet with economists. And even though we have a small operation in Brazil, as a country, I still remain concerned about Brazil short term. As you know, they had a significant recession last year. I think the outlook this year is for modest improvement with positive GDP but very, very modest. So, short term, I'm still bearish on Brazil. I like our partnership in Brazil. We continue to work close with our Brazilian partners, and I don't feel that right now is the time to make a decision to be bigger, stronger, better in Brazil at this juncture. Manav Patnaik : Got it. Thanks a lot, guys. Rick Smith : Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from George Mihalos from Cowen & Company. George Mihalos : Great. Good morning, guys and congrats on the nice start to the year. Wanted to start off on the guidance. It looks like, from a revenue perspective, you're talking about a pretty consistent 7 percentage type growth over the remainder of the year. And I'm just wondering, given that the mortgage comparisons will get tougher in the back half and you've lapped the trended data pricing benefit, what do you expect to sort of perk up to maintain that level of 7% constant currency organic growth? John Gamble : Great question. As we've talked about -- remember -- if you remember the call in February where there was significant concern at that time because of the mortgage market rates going up and mortgage market declining, ACA being repealed. And we talked then about our confidence levels driven by EGI and NPI, that remains the case today. I alluded to, in the February call, I think even a couple of times last year, George, that our classified last year was an unbelievable classifieds that will bode well for that year, minus ramp up at the back half of the year. Secondly as I said in my prepared comments, the class of products that we're launching, the pipeline of products in 2017 is as strong as ever. John Gamble : And if you look at the constant currency growth we're talking about in 2Q '17, if you add back the drag from mortgage, it really looks pretty consistent what we delivered in the first quarter. And then if you take a look at total constant currency growth for the first half, we're looking at 11%, right? So, I think the performance overall in the first quarter and the second quarter and when you take a look at the entire first half growth at 11%, it looks very, very good. Rick Smith : Well said. George Mihalos : Yes, that's great. If I could just sneak in two quick follow-ups. Just John the, within USIS, the financial marketing line, that's been a little bit more volatile the last couple of quarters. It seems to have a really strong quarter, then the growth rate comes in a little bit, a little bit more volatile than what I think we've been used to seeing historically. Any sort of commentary or insight around that? And then as it relates to the USIS margins, they were pretty much in line with the year ago. We've kind of gotten used to them sort of expanding consistently. Just any color you could provide around that. Thank you. John Gamble : Sure. Financial marketing line, as you know, that can be a little bit lumpy. We're seeing nice growth in prescreen, and we think that's an area where we're probably going to see good performance throughout the rest of this year. But it will be lumpy as you look through the rest of the year as well. In terms of USIS margins, we're very happy with our margins. They were basically flat. We're continuing to expect them to go up. The small movements that you see in any given quarter are really just mix related, and sometimes related to the lumpy revenue that we just talked about. But generally speaking, USIS margins have been outstanding and we're expecting very good performance this year. Rick Smith : George, the model we gave, if I could just add on, is for USIS's margin to be -- EBITDA margins to be in the low 50s over time. That's still the goal and you'll see movement throughout any 1 quarter. As you know, there's just a lot of moving parts and, but they're still well on track to make that mid-50s over time and I -- we expect to -- second quarter 2017 to be better than first quarter 2017. George Mihalos : Great. Thank you, guys. Operator : We'll take our next question from Brett Huff with Stephens Inc. Brett Huff : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. As you look forward to guidance, Rick, I asked you this question in the last call and there's just some concern in the market that you guys usually have some cushion in your guidance that allows you to kind of have some raises through the year, but there is some concern, given you had to absorb the 300-basis-point headwind from mortgage and a little more from ACA. I think before, you said it was kind of a balanced view of guidance. Anything to update us on that given that mortgage seems to be a little bit better maybe than we're expecting, at least it was in 1Q? Maybe a little bit more insight into the NPI drivers in the back half of the year? Any sort of updated thoughts on your take on guidance? Rick Smith : Sure. I, and John and I feel as confident today towards the year outlook and guidance as we were when we gave it to you in February, we take that very seriously. As far as mortgage goes, no, as I said in my prepared comments, the mortgage performance for us came in largely as expected in the first quarter. The team continues to significantly outperform the market, but the actual revenue drive for mortgage was in line with our expectations. At this juncture, we continue to stick to our 15% total market down for the year. So, no little change there. So, it's just now a matter of the team continue to what they've done for years, which is execute on NPI, execute on EGI, execute on Lean and deliver those goals. So, I remain very confident. Brett Huff : That's helpful. And then just my follow-up is, as we look, I know we're not talking about guidance for '18 and that's a long way away, but what are the puts and takes on growth that we should be thinking about as we move into '18? And, I guess, just thinking out loud, mortgage, as well as maybe the even better '17 class of NPI products that you've been talking about. Maybe TDX gets a little bit better. What kind of the -- what are the pros and the cons we need to think about as we think about '18? I think many investors are thinking about what does that growth look like? Rick Smith : Yes, Brett, just off the top of my head because you're right, that is a long way away. One thing you have is you got about 5, 6, 7 weeks of Veda this year we didn't have last year, which we'll anniversary that. We have anniversaried that. That goes away. Mortgage, I got to believe that majority of the mortgage will bottom out this year, maybe some stability next year, that could be a help. Number three, may have improvement with the classifieds. As you know, with the classifieds from '16, we launched extra few years to truly materialize and reach their full inflection points, so that should be a benefit, same with classified '17, so. I also think that if the economists are right and the parts of the world in which we operate, we just got an economic update the other day, that the economies that are important to us should continue to improve. And if they improve, our business improves. Brett Huff : Great. That's what I needed. Thanks for your time guys. Operator : We'll take our next question from Kevin McVeigh with Deutsche Bank. Kevin Damien : Great. Thank you very much. I wonder if you could just give us a sense. It sounds like trended data in mortgage is the largest opportunity. I'm trying to really frame out what it would be in auto and other areas as you roll that out. Rick Smith : Yes. Thank you, Kevin. We're optimistic. And we've talked about this now for about a year. I think the industry got a little ahead of itself in the optimism on trended data, before the analytics was completed. We're largely, as I said in my prepared comments, we'll complete that analysis very, very soon in the U.S. then we'll take it to other parts of the world where we're looking at verticals and the sub-verticals. So, auto versus prime vs sub-prime card, prime versus sub-prime versus neoprime, home equity so on, and so forth. So, this year, you should think of the revenue as far as the guidance goes, including trended data benefit from mortgage only will be the outer years, will get the lift in other verticals, but we're not prepared to frame that up yet. Kevin Damien : Got it. Helpful. And then just real quick. If we did get these changes in terms of personal, obviously the corporate will -- is beneficial, but personal income tax rate changes. How does that impact the business, particularly TALX? Does that provide incremental revenue opportunities as we work our way through '17 and into '18, based on just new rates? Rick Smith : All right, by individual tax reform in the U.S, is that your question, Kevin? Kevin Damien : Yes, sir. Rick Smith : In theory, any time that we get more cash in the pockets, they're more likely to spend the cash, to do as to fuel economic growth. So -- and again, as the economy grows, our business grows better. Kevin Damien : Awesome. Thank you, guys. Operator : We'll take the next question from Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs. Andre Benjamin : Thank you. Good morning. For my first question, you talked a little bit about the progress of the verification product in Canada. I was just wondering if you can maybe give us an update on -- or a little more detail on potential timing of when that could be up and running. What's left to get it across the finish line? And then maybe, I know it's a little long term, but how that size is versus what you're thinking -- what will you see in the U.S. Rick Smith : I missed that last part Andre, if you could\u2026 Andre Benjamin : How -- I know it's long term, but how big you think that opportunity could be versus the business in the U.S, given what you've seen about, in that vein. Rick Smith : Overall, we're thrilled, as you know, with the overall progress in the context with the EWS in it. It's been an unbelievable home run for us. It's hard to believe it's been 10 years now. And the Work Number is one of the, obviously, the gems within that business. And long term, as you know, it is not just Canada. It's taking you to other developed parts of the world where we have a need. We've got a full-time dedicated team now. We've got dedicated technology platforms, we have strategies beyond Canada. So, expect to wake up in a few years and see us in far more than just Canada as we talked about Australia and interest goes, U.K. and other places. Specific to Canada it's going well, as I alluded in my prepared comments the contribution of records is exceeding our expectations. I caution everyone to think about that as a multi-year return and not a single return. And once you get into a country with a platform like that, your ability to add different products, to solve different problems for customers in that arena are expanded. So, the opportunity would be beyond just the Work Number and Verification Services in Canada and other parts will augment it with other products as well. But think of it as a nice way of a multiple years to continue to expand the size, the profitability of EWS. Andre Benjamin : And then on the opportunities for trended data outside mortgage, we understand you're kind of working through the sizing of that and what customers, ultimately, will want from you. Could you maybe talk a little bit about just based on what you're seeing so far, maybe a handicap, which ones you think are likely to become earlier contributors between all autos, cards and home equity? Rick Smith : I would think auto will be #1, followed by card and home equity. If I had a handicap, it seems similar order, and that's in the U.S. and we're still doing work outside U.S. Andre Benjamin : Okay. Thank you. Rick Smith : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Tim McHugh with William Blair. Tim McHugh : Hey guys. Thank you. Just want to -- I think you mentioned you thought USIS would grow faster in the second quarter than the first, this is some improvement in some parts of the business, besides mortgage, I guess. Can you elaborate on what you see performing better as we move into the second quarter? Rick Smith : Yes. Tim, I'll start and John can add to it. But anytime you look at it, a particular quarter, particularly BU, you're going to see lumpiness. And that's probably what you've seen in the second quarter versus the first quarter of USIS is probably some contracts, new product innovation and USIS is ramping up. I talked about InstaTouch that's starting in USIS. Some fraud products that are being launched and will benefit in the second quarter. So, it's a variety of things you'll see in the second quarter that you didn't see in the first quarter. But again, I think the more important thing is to try to get context for the full year. And we gave guidance for USIS the framework for that back in February, and they're going to be in that range for the full year. So slightly maybe below, actually they're in the range in the first quarter. Will be above that range in the second quarter, but full year, solidly within the range. John Gamble : And the growth is really across multiple segments, right? If you take a look at USIS, we think, we're going to see expanded growth, generally speaking, across the bulk other segments, other than mortgage, right? Tim McHugh : Okay. And -- I think you said commercial was down. Is there any change in -- or was that just timing as well for, I guess, for Q1? Rick Smith : Yes, John did say that in his prepared comments. And Tim, 2 things. Again, any context is important commercial, small as you know is slightly down in the first quarter, but we're making a transition, as you know, from this platform exchange called SPFE to a new exchange called CFN. CFN is starting to ramp up. That has some impact for SPFE and you won't fully see CFN fully ramped up until later on this year. And as we exit this year and go in 2018. So that's what you're seeing this lumpiness during SPFE and CFN. John Gamble : The nice thing about CFN at this point is in terms of the creation of the exchange and the contributors it's just gone incredibly well. And we, at this point, have garnered the vast majority of the contributors we hoped to achieve, including Telcos, including other top side of the traditional banking industry. So, we think it's a superior exchange, and we're very happy with the way it's been built. Rick Smith : Well said. Tim McHugh : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from David Togut with Evercore ISI. David Togut : Thanks. Good morning. Rick, could you give us an update on where you stand in Workforce Solutions and in terms of building out the number of work number records? And in connection with that, any insights you have into hit ratio on that business would be appreciated? Rick Smith : Thanks, David. I am thrilled. I was just out in St. Louis, I think it was last week ,for a review with Murray and his team. And the progress they are making is unbelievable. On active records, total records, partner relationships was established to solve problems and create a network effect is unbelievable, and I gave you some comments there in -- my comments -- in my prepared comments today, which is now we are linking together the credit, the data in the credit file with The Work Number records to augment and expand our ability to deliver value back to the customer. So, in the past, I couldn't find someone on The Work Number database. But if I can combine with the credit file, I can enhance that, deliver a yes, move some insight back to the customer, which is proving to be hugely valuable to our customers, which will accelerate growth for us. We just launched that capability of our product late in the first quarter. So that's a way to think about we augmented credit data with a work number database. It's a way to, as you call it, record, get a hit rate or a yes back to a customer for a higher rate than in the past. So, they are -- they're clicking on all cylinders out there. David Togut : Got it. And then just as a quick follow-up. On mortgage, we appreciate all the helpful detail. With Equifax's total mortgage revenue up 22% in the quarter against the down U.S. mortgage market, why shouldn't we expect this level of sustained out performance to continue and perhaps, your expectations overall, for mortgage to turn out to be too conservative for this year? Rick Smith : Let me give you some color on that. The mortgage market was as expected in the first quarter. And by the way, when you look at the -- what they call the mortgage banker's index, that's an application look versus the volume look, there's always a lag in application of the volume, we tend to look at volumes. So, the volume performed about as expected. You are correct we did outperform, but clearly expect us to continue to outperform in the second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter in '18 as well. However, we do expect the volume activity in mortgage, if this 10-year target's is doing we're talking about do decline, the mid-single digits in the second quarter and strong double-digit in the third and fourth quarter, for a total of 15% for the year. John Gamble : And keep in mind, right, we get the benefit from trended data pricing in terms of the lift for the first effectively 2.5 quarters of the year because we started shipping trended data in August last year. Rick Smith : And Dave, one last thing, we're expecting rate increases. We're expecting 10-year treasuries to go up, obviously, between now and year-end. If they don't go up as strong as we expect them to go, yes, you're right, that would be a tailwind for us. If they go up, or higher than we expect, that'll be more headwind, but right now I think we're in a balanced position. David Togut : What assumption do you have for 10-year treasury yields then, by year-end? Rick Smith : We're expecting it, and I'm not sure of the exact number, a couple I think two or three rate increases between now and year-end, David. Similar with what we were talking about, yes. David Togut : Okay. Thank you very much. Rick Smith : Thank you, David. Operator : We'll take our next question from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Patrick Halfmann : Good morning, everyone. This is Patrick in for Tony. It sounded like growth from the direct-to-consumer business came in maybe a little bit lighter than you'd previously expected. Do you think you're beginning to see an impact from the rapid growth of your indirect channels and partners like Credit Karma? Rick Smith : No. I think, again, this is lumpy but the thing maybe to frame is this, we gave a multi-year framework a couple of years ago. We have reinforced that framework last year and this year of 5% to 8%, and we do expect direct-to-consumer to be in that 5% to 8% for the year. Patrick Halfmann : Got it. And then one quick follow-up, if I could. I'm wondering if you've begun to see a discernible change in demand for the employment and income inquiries since The Work Number become integrated into the desktop underwriter system late last year. Rick Smith : I don't know that. I don't think I have that trend. That's a great question, Patrick. And obviously, if any of you may, I don't have that answer off the top of my head. Patrick Halfmann : No worries. Thanks Rick. Rick Smith : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. Gary Bisbee : Hey guys. Good morning. I guess given the mortgage in ACA drag this year that you've talked about and what was obviously a benefit from mortgage last year, is it reasonable to say that your underlying organic revenue growth without that is actually accelerating solidly this year? Is that a fair assessment just from all the NPI success? John Gamble : Can you ask that one more time to make sure we're clear on what you're parsing there? Gary Bisbee : If we just -- if we backed out, right, the benefit you had last year for mortgage market volumes but also ignored the negative hit this year and, obviously, the fact that Veda helped growth last year, is the underlying growth ex that accelerating? I mean, just given the commentary in NPI in the last 2.5 years, it would suggest that it should be, and I think it is, I just wondered if you'd confirm that? John Gamble : In terms of the math, right, last year's organic was very high at around 12%. And yes, mortgage was a benefit we also had a really nice benefit from ACA growth last year, right? So, as you do that analysis, you just need to make sure you take both of those things into account and -- to determine where you think that shakes out. But the growth related to mortgage in ACA were a nice contributor to growth last year, and we're not really going to see either of those this year. So, if you're just backing out mortgage, that maybe a tough comparison. Rick Smith : So, the only thing with that is backing out mortgage and ACA, you'd expect to see organic constant currency growth rate well above, nicely above the long-term range in this year again. Gary Bisbee : Yes. Yes. It just seems to me if it was several points benefit last year, several points drag this year. You're actually doing better this year without those cyclical market factors from your organic underlying performance, but that's fine. That's good. I'll move on. On the Ignite product, the product launch, what's the revenue model? And can you help us understand how that works with customers? Is this more just increasing the stickiness by giving them more functionality in how they're using the product? And over time if they build new models themselves using it, that's an incremental revenue? Or is there actually going to be a charge associated with the two parts of that offering? Rick Smith : Thanks, Gary. The thing about Ignite and, again, two different buckets. One is direct, one is marketplace, and direct has created this environment, the cloud has our data, their data and these -- the data scientists, more customers can access that, anytime they access it they pay for the data that they're accessing, and also it helps us facilitate the building of new products in the marketplace. Just think of an app-- like an app on your phone where there are configurable apps that the business community where our customers can download those, use those. So, there's typically -- there are two ways you make money. One is there tends to be, in some cases, a fee for setting up the environment for our customers; number two, is obviously they pay if they access the data. So financially the model is very much majority of the model, will be very much like you've seen across the rest of the business, which is accessing our unique data assets. Gary Bisbee : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Andrew Jeffrey : Hi. Good morning, guys. Rick, your enterprise initiatives seem to be proving out really nicely. Can you sort of characterize the contribution from enterprise spending or enterprise clients in your current revenue composition? What it might tell us about where we are in the credit cycle or if that's even sort of relevant to the growth you've laid out? Rick Smith : Yes, I think strategically it's relevant. What we're trying to do is combine technically, analytically and data and that our go-to-market strategy across multiple -- be used to solve problems for customers. So, we get into it. If you could take a piece of our product more likely a USIS product and a EWS product, bundle those product offerings technically and analytically together, delivering a single solution to the customer that no one else can deliver. That enterprise solution is a differentiation versus others in the marketplace, enables us to take share and drive pricing and drive revenue. So, I don't break it out that way. I just know it's the right thing to do. And we've done the vast majority of the vertical alliance or verticals we've attacked have been driven by USIS. I alluded to in my comments that we still have this government vertical where we had more expertise, bigger channels and pipes through EWS. EWS is now dragging along all of the capabilities we have to solve these problems. So, it's a strategic differentiator is the way to think about it, we don't break out the actual revenue contribution. Andrew Jeffrey : Okay. And with regard to auto in particular, what is the risk as you look forward in the back half of '17, maybe '18, if we are indeed at peaks are. What might that mean for revenue growth? Is that a call out, potentially the way mortgage in ACA are? Rick Smith : No, I don't think so. For a couple of reasons. Not nearly as big, number one. Number two, is our assumption that we peak, so the guidance within the industry. And this is the U.S. The guidance we gave -- the framework we gave last year and the guidance we gave in February and the guidance we're reaffirming today is assuming new sales of vehicles in the U.S. and a peak at 17-something. I can't remember what the number is, 17-something for the year. I don't expect that to go up at all. You kind of -- that's a new high for us. However, I do expect us to continue to find ways to partner with others that have pipes and relationships with the channel partners we talked about, Andrew, for quite some time, to continue to help us fuel growth. So, I think in our prepared comments, we talked about auto and EWS was a growth driver for them. I expect that to continue to happen. So, one, you've got to make sure we're putting in context is nowhere near the size of the mortgage for us; two, the result will let it penetrate; three, these channel partners are vital to us and a good source of growth. Andrew Jeffrey : Okay. Perfect. Thanks. Operator : We'll take the next question from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Andrew Steinerman : Hi John, could you just give us the Veda revenues for the first quarter and just give us some sense generally how you expect to do for the year? John Gamble : Yes. We think for the first quarter, we gave it in the script, right? So those revenues, Asia-Pacific is virtually all Veda revenues. There's almost nothing that was there before. And that the performance of Veda was pretty much as we expected in 2016. I think we indicated when we acquired them long term, we're expecting them to grow kind of consistent with our growth rates, and we're very, very happy with the way they're performing and we expect them to perform on about that basis, as we look at '17 and beyond. Andrew Steinerman : Okay. Thank you. Rick Smith : Okay. I want to thank everybody for their time and their interest in Equifax. And with that, operator, we will conclude the call. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you, for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Baird Kevin McVeigh - Deutsche Bank Andrew Steinerman - J. P. Morgan Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Equifax Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Dodge. Please go ahead. Jeff Dodge : Thanks and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Jeff Dodge with Investor Relations; and with me today are Rick Smith, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer; and Doug Brandberg with Investor Relations. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax's tab of our website at www.equifax.com. During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2016 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. Also, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA margin, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability and the underlying operational performance. For the second quarter of 2017, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes acquisition-related amortization expense and the income tax effects of stock awards recognized upon vesting or settlement. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as net income attributable to Equifax, adding back income tax expense, interest expense, net of interest income and depreciation and amortization. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our website. Please also refer to our various investor presentations, which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website for further details. Now I'd like to turn it over to Rick. Rick Smith : Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Thanks again for joining us for our call. The second quarter was another solid, broad-based performance by the team. Revenue performance at USIS, Workforce Solutions and International was very strong in the quarter with all 3 units meeting or exceeding our expectations. Global Consumer revenue was weaker-than-expected, which I'll discuss later. Overall revenue performance for the quarter was strong and within our expectations, even though the FX headwind was stronger-than-expected. Adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted EPS performance were both very strong in the quarter. Both were better than our expectations. Strong revenue growth and very high margin, USIS and EWS Verifier and in Canada and Argentina led to the strong margin and profit performance. The performance we have coming out of the second quarter positions us very well for the second half of 2017. Total revenue for the quarter was $857 million, up 6% on a reported basis and up 7% on a local-currency basis when compared to second quarter 2016. For the quarter, FX created about almost approximately $10 million of year-over-year headwind, which is more than we had expected. Revenue for the quarter adjusted for the higher FX impact, again, was within our expectations. The adjusted EBITDA margin was very strong at 39.1%, which is up 250 basis points over a year ago with very good expansion across all of our business units. Adjusted EPS was also very strong at $1.60, up 12% year-over-year. As I always do, I'll jump into some BU activities and come back to some corporate highlights and then turn it over to John. Let me start with USIS. They delivered a strong 8% revenue growth in the quarter, up from 5% in the first quarter. We delivered a stronger growth despite a weaker mortgage market in the second quarter. The growth was broad based in the Marketing Services business at 15% growth was very strong. This reflects both new products and our expanding capabilities driven by Cambrian analytics, and the new delivery platforms we've talked to you about in the past. Adjusted EBITDA margin performance was very good, up over 100 basis points from 2016 coming in at 51.5%. Last quarter, we announced Ignite, our portfolio of data and analytics solutions powered by our Cambrian platform. Customer reception of our Ignite portfolio of solutions has been extremely positive. Ignite's capabilities are comprehensive and enable a full range of offerings from predefined to configurable to highly customized solutions that again leverage Equifax's broad and unique data assets, including trended data. We're incorporating trended data and other unique data into additional scores and insights for multiple verticals within our Ignite portfolio. Combination of Equifax Ignite and trended data in one platform is powerful in many ways, including allowing our customers to create their own trended attributes and use those along with our unique data in their custom models. Our solutions enable customers to create unique analysis through simple configuration of an extremely wide range of parameters, including things like data assets utilized, risk score type, peer group period, update frequency and segmentation. Ignite is used not only to develop new models, but also to continually validate predictiveness of existing models. Both our Ignite Direct and Marketplace solutions are resonating with our customers. Ignite will be deployed everywhere we deploy Cambrian. By the end of next year, we'll be in Australia, New Zealand, Europe, Argentina, Chile, Peru, U.S. and Canada. It's still early days, but Ignite is ramping up nicely and being very well received. We're excited about the meaningful medium- and long-term opportunity for our Cambrian platform and our Ignite portfolio solutions. Staying in USIS. Last quarter, we discussed our launch of InstaTouch mobile solution. InstaTouch provides a simple method to verify the identity of the user of a mobile device and for the user to access Equifax data assets easily and securely pre-populate personal identity and payment information into an application or complete a purchase, improving the conversion rate and reducing the abandonment rate because the friction has been reduced. We're deployed with a major financial institution and expect significant expansion opportunities and new customers over the remainder of 2017 and 2018. While this product is led by USIS, this also has tremendous application in Workforce Solutions employer services, also in Global Consumer and International. So said another way, InstaTouch will be a platform we're deploying around the world. As InstaTouch leverages our global decision platform InterConnect, which you're familiar with, it can be deployed globally, taking advantage of that infrastructure. A great example of leveraging the NPI process and our global IT infrastructure to accelerate product development and revenue. Onto Workforce Solutions. They continue to deliver strong performance with 10% revenue growth in the quarter. The team continues to make great progress penetrating key verticals, introducing innovative new solutions and expanding the business model beyond the U.S. Adjusted EBITDA margins continue to expand, up 100 basis points to over 51%. Verifier grew a very strong 19% in the second quarter despite weaker mortgage activity for the quarter. The strategy is hitting on all cylinders as the team executes on a number of initiatives, which are driving a record level of additions to The Work Number database. Performance in the second quarter was very broad-based with strong growth across government, card, preemployment screening, auto and mortgage. Last quarter, we told you about our progress towards launching a Workforce Solutions business in Canada. In May, we launched our verification of income, verification of employment and record of employment solutions in Canada. We have a growing list of clients across multiple verticals, including government, consumer finance, mortgage, auto and background screening. Just like in the U.S., the strategic focus in Canada is on record acquisition, adding verifiers and a network effect that, that creates. We're now receiving records from several large employers, and we're making very good progress in adding more employers and more records. As some of you know, lending practices in Canada, particularly in mortgage, have come under increased scrutiny recently. We're furthering our market leadership position with the launch of our income and employment solutions in Canada. It's come to a good time for us and for our customers. We're more focused now than ever on improving the quality of their underwriting decisions and minimizing fraud. Speaking of Workforce Solutions, beyond the U.S. is a great example of our enterprise growth initiative process that we've talked to you about for years now. We often use, as you know, for more complex initiatives that cut across multiple business units and/or geographies. The Workforce Solutions business model is very attractive and a great addition to our core financial information services businesses around the world. The global opportunity here is significant. We have a leadership team with an experience and in-depth understanding of how to make that happen, a good technology platform and working diligently right now in Australia and the UK In longer term, there are additional geographies beyond Canada, UK and Australia that we hope to take Workforce Solutions to. Global Consumer Solutions revenue performance in the first half of 2017 saw some significant annual customer delivery shift between the first and second quarters, as we discussed with you in April. As such, to gauge performance, we need to look at the total first half versus the individual quarters. At 2% local currency growth for the first half, performance is weaker than our long-term range of 5% to 8% in our previous guidance. As we've discussed, Equifax recognized the shift occurring in the U.S. consumer market several years ago as new entrants, including those with lead generation-based business models entered the market. We've broadened our strategy to embrace those new channels and partners and the expansion into new geographies as we do across our B2B businesses and performed extremely well, exceeding our growth targets. Our long-term growth targets reflect the expectation of a softer U.S. pay consumer market. GCS will deliver 5% to 8% growth in this environment through a four pronged approach : number one, expansion of partnerships with these new entrants as well as traditional players; number two, expansion into new geographies with paid offerings where Equifax's unique data will allow sustainable growth; number three, expansion of channels to reach consumers in the U.S. and other markets where Equifax's unique data assets and relationships provide a competitive advantage; and four, NPI, driving new products based on Equifax's unique data assets like our tax fraud product and additional credit identity protection or warning and breach products in our NPI pipeline. We've executed well on the partnership expansion. We're making good progress on the geographic and channel expansion and also on NPI, but the progress was somewhat slower than we expected in the first half. Our confidence in the ultimate success of these initiatives, however, is unchanged. However, the slower progress has negatively impacted revenue performance in the first half of 2017. And as we go into the third quarter of 2017, we expect revenue for GCS to be likely approximately flat when compared to 2016 of third quarter. However, we are expecting to see improving growth in Q4 2017 with GCS getting back into their long-term range of 5% to 8% growth leading also to a stronger 2018. International delivered another impressive quarter, delivering 10% local currency revenue growth with strong performance on new product initiatives that are performing well above our targets. International also delivered 250 basis points of margin expansion through both strong growth in our higher margin countries and continued focus on cost management and our ongoing program to consolidate global functions. Europe had another strong quarter with 12% local currency revenue growth. The debt management business in the UK continues to be a growth driver, as we broaden our relationship with the UK government. Collections performance continues to be -- continues to improve, and the outcomes are ahead of our expectations. Additionally, the amount of debt placed remained robust in the second quarter, and we have a strong pipeline of additional new business opportunities with both new and existing customers. Our core financial data business in the UK and Spain also saw a good growth in the quarter, driven by Decision Solutions growth, reflecting our accelerating growth in deployments of our global interconnect and EID platforms through both expansion in existing and winning new customers. Our Asia-Pacific business grew 4% in local currency and was in line with our expectations for the quarter. Our acquired Veda business grew at over 5% in the quarter with a nice adjusted EBITDA margin performance above 35%. In the second quarter 2016 in Australia, we delivered a large onetime project that drove significant revenue in the year-ago period, impacting the year-over-year growth this quarter. We're expecting to see good acceleration of growth in the second half of 2017 starting in the third quarter with overall organic growth for the period in high-single digits. As we announced last month, Paulino Barros has moved to city to become President of Equifax Asia-Pacific. Paulino delivered great results as President of our International business and most recently, our USIS business. We're confident with Paulino in place, we'll see successful implementation of our critical management disciplines of NPI, EGI and Lean over the coming years as well as quickly restarting our focus on M&A in that region. Latin America had another impressive quarter with 14% local currency growth. Growth continues to be broad-based and led by outstanding performance in our largest countries in the region. We continue to expand our technology capabilities in the region and we're on track to deploy InterConnect and Cambrian across the region within the next year. Team in Latin America delivered strong results on New Product Innovation with NPI revenues more than 20% ahead of our second quarter targets. Canada had a very strong quarter with local currency growth in the second quarter of 8% and over 9% growth for the first half of the year. Team is driving improved new product innovation, accelerated by their implementation of Cambrian and those new solutions are resonating well with our customers and help us continue to drive share gain in a market where we already have very high share. Canada had several nice wins in the quarter, including a contract with a large financial institution to provide unique Lean monitoring solutions for auto loans, which helps reconcile vehicle registration data with Equifax credit reporting data to ensure the integrity of the Lean throughout the life cycle. Before I hand it over to John, let me make a few comments at the corporate level, and then John will get into the financial details. First, our NPI portfolio continues to perform very well. The performance is broad-based across business units and verticals. NPI revenues and our vitality Index were nicely above our expectations for the second quarter and for the first half of the year. Number of products launched year-to-date were up 36% over 2016; and our pipeline of products, which we were talking about in the past, is up 45% over 2016. Both those metrics bode well for the end of 2017 and 2018 and beyond. We continue to realize significant value on our Lean initiatives across our business units and geographies. In the second quarter and for the first half of the year, we exceeded our Lean target by more than 20%, with the portfolio of Lean initiatives for every business unit performing ahead of our expectations. We continue -- we expect continued strong execution in the second half of the year. Lean is a fundamental process to drive both revenue and operating efficiencies, and you continue to see the team's execution and focus reflected in our top line growth as well as our margin expansion that you're seeing over the past few years. Client Lean where our teams work directly with customers at their locations this year, our Lean expertise to help our customers solve problems, has also had a great and strong first half of 2017. Increasingly, Cambrian Ignite is becoming a tool for our client Lean teams as we help our customers accelerate their ability to utilize Cambrian in their own process improvement initiatives. Last quarter, I briefly discussed the importance of enterprise vertical and alliance strategy and its importance in driving revenue growth across USIS and Workforce Solutions. You will see continued integration of delivery channels across USIS and Workforce as we move throughout 2017 and 2018, including significant expansion of third party partner relationships. This is a significant focus of our investment in 2017. Enterprise vertical and alliance strategy is also a driver of growth in GCS, partnering with Workforce Solutions to expand customer access. In summary, our performance in second quarter and the first half of 2016 has been very strong with first half local currency revenue growth of 11% and adjusted EPS growth of 14%. Equifax continues to demonstrate a consistent performance delivered by our focus on and continuous improvement of our critical growth processes of EGI, NPI, Alliances and Lean. Equifax has the most uniquely data in our industry, and we're building on our leadership position in the U.S. and around the world. We're uniquely positioned to turn data into actual insights through leading-edge technology and data and analytics capabilities. The opportunities in front of us are simply tremendous, and a high level of execution gives me confidence as I look ahead to the second half of 2017 and 2018 and beyond. And with that, let me turn it over to John for the financials, and I'll come back with some guidance and full year color. John? John Gamble : Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As before, I will generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis. We had a solid 2Q and first half, which puts us on a good path to deliver 2017. Revenue adjusted for FX was within our expectations, and adjusted EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS were very strong and well ahead of our expectations. USIS revenue in 2Q '17 was $332 million, up 8% when compared to the second quarter of 2016. This is very strong when considering the impact of the decline in overall mortgage market increase. Online Information Solutions revenue was $233 million, up 6% when compared to the year ago period. Online Information Solutions reflect double digit growth in Identity and Fraud Solutions and telecommunications revenues. The 6% growth in Online Information Solutions represents very nice acceleration from 1Q growth despite the impact of a weaker mortgage market in 2Q. Mortgage market increase weakened in 2Q versus 1Q, declining in the high single-digit percentages in the second quarter, which was consistent with our expectations. Total market-related revenue for Equifax -- total mortgage-market related revenue for Equifax was up 13%. We continue to expect a significant decline in mortgage market inquiries in 2017, but we now expect the decline to be somewhat less for the full year than the 15% we had discussed in our 1Q earnings release. For 3Q '17, we expect the mortgage market to be down 10% to 15% year-to-year with a significant decline also expected for 4Q. Financial Marketing Services revenue was $61 million in 2Q '17, up 15%. While revenue performance can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter due to project-related revenues in this segment, we were very pleased with our 2Q growth of 15%, which was up nicely on a sequential basis from 1Q. Performance was broad based within the segment, and we are encouraged with trends we are seeing. We saw strong double digit growth in both our traditional credit marketing services to financial institutions as well as double digit growth in our other marking-related revenue streams, including our unique asset and wealth database. Through the first half of the year, Financial Marketing Services revenue was up 9% compared to 4% in the first half of 2016. The adjusted EBITDA margin for USIS was very strong 51.5%, up over 100 basis points from 50.4% in 2Q '16. As you remember, selling trended data reports to the mortgage industry on August of 2016. USIS revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth in 3Q and 4Q '17 will be negatively impacted as we lap the launch of trended data in mortgage. Also, the expected 10% to 15% decline in overall mortgage market increase creates an approximately 400-basis-point headwind to USIS revenue growth in 3Q '17. Excluding these impacts, we would again expect USIS revenue to exceed our long-term range of 5% to 7%. Reflecting these impacts, we expect USIS revenue growth to be low single-digit percentage in 3Q '17. For the year, USIS revenue is expected to be stronger than we previously expected, but still slightly below their long-term model of 5% to 7%, with this again driven by the headwinds created by the expected decline in overall mortgage market activity. Workforce Solutions revenue was $195 million in the quarter, up 10% when compared to 2Q 2016. Verification Services delivered a very strong quarter with revenue of $130 million, up 19%. Growth was broad-based with strong growth in government, card, pre-employment screening, auto and mortgage. Our enterprise vertical strategy is working very well as our enterprise sales teams across USIS and Verification Services work together to penetrate markets and deliver innovative solutions to our customers. Combined revenue for USIS and Verification Services revenue was $462 million in the quarter, up 11%. Employer Services revenue of $64 million declined 5% versus last year. Employer Services, excluding our Workforce Analytics business, grew over 7% in the quarter, driven by nice growth in several of our tax and compliance and on boarding solutions. Workforce Analytics, our business that helps employers stay in compliance with Affordable Care Act, was down about 40% in 2Q '17. We mentioned in our last call that employers completed tax reporting for 1095s and 1094s much earlier in 2017 than they did in 2016, benefiting Workforce Analytics revenue in 1Q but creating a difficult comp in 2Q. Our revenue for Workforce Analytics has progressed in line with our expectations so far in 2017, down a little over 1% for the first half. We continue to expect our total ACA revenue to be about flat for 2017 versus 2016. Looking forward, we expect employer to grow high single-digit percent in the second half of 2017. The Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margin was a very strong 51.2% in 2Q '17, up 100 basis points from 50.2% in 2Q '16. This reflects continued strengthening of mix as high margin Verifier continues to grow aggressively as well as good cost control. Workforce Solutions grew at 10% was very strong, but down from 1Q '17 due to the significant timing-related decline in 2Q '17 Workforce Analytics revenue. As a result, we expect Workforce Solutions' overall growth to increase in the second half. For the full year, we expect continued strengthening of Workforce Solutions revenue at levels above our long-term model. Global Consumer Solutions revenue at $99 million in 2Q '17 was down 8% on a reported basis and down 7% on a local currency basis. As we discussed in April, 1Q '17 revenue growth was benefited by more than 5 percentage points, as the timing of an expected annual purchase of data by our reseller partner occurred in 1Q '17 versus 2Q '16 in the prior year. Adjusted for this occurrence, GCS 1Q '17 revenue was up about 7% on a local-currency basis and 2Q '17 revenue was down just over 1% on a local-currency basis. For the first half of 2017, local currency revenue is up about 2%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 31% in 2Q '17 and was 31.4% for the first half. As Rick discussed, revenue performance was weaker-than-expected in 2Q and is performing below our full year expectation as growth on our geographic channel and NPI growth initiatives has been slower than we had planned. As a result, we expect GCS revenue to be about flat in 3Q '17 and for the full year to be below their long-term range of 5% to 8%. However, as Rick indicated, we do expect to exit 2017 with stronger growth rates and improve the growth again in 2018. Adjusted EBITDA margins in GCS will decline sequentially in 3Q and rebound in 4Q. International revenue was $231 million, up in 2Q '17, up 6% on a reported basis and up 10% on a local-currency basis. By region, Europe's revenue was $69 million in 2Q '17, up 2% in U.S. dollars and up 12% in local currency. Asia-Pacific revenue was $77 million, up 6% in U.S. dollars and 4% in local currency. This performance was in line with our expectations for the quarter. Our acquired Veda assets grew at over 5% in the quarter, slightly below our long-term expectation, reflecting that in 2Q '16, Veda delivered a large onetime project, which drove significant revenue in the year ago period. As Rick indicated, for second half of '17, we're expecting growth for Veda, we're expecting growth for Veda and high-single-digit growth overall for the nine months ending 2017. Latin America's revenue was $53 million in 2Q '17, up 13% in U.S. dollars and up 14% in local currency. Canada's revenue was $34 million, up 4% in U.S. dollars and up 8% in local currency. International's adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.9% in 2Q '17, up from 28.4% a year ago. Margin expansion was outstanding and reflects the focused growth in high-margin products as well as continued execution on a long-term project to consolidate support services. For all of 2017, we continue to expect revenue growth for International to be above their long term 8% to 10% range. In the quarter, general corporate expense was $48.1 million. For Equifax, adjusted EBITDA margin was 39.1% in 2Q '17, up 250 basis points from 2Q '16. This was an outstanding performance and reflected positive revenue mix across the BUs and within the BUs themselves and very good cost control in the BUs and centrally. Looking forward, we expect continued significant year-to-year improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin but not to the degree we saw in 2Q. Revenue mix is unlikely to be as positive as the overall mortgage market weakens and lower margin GCS revenue recovers. Timing of equity compensation grants increases variable compensation expense in 3Q. Investment spending related to EGIs and other significant programs increases in 3Q. This is mostly timing effect. And also, acquisition and integration cost will increase. Our GAAP effective tax rate was 30.9% in the quarter and includes $4.8 million benefit from the income tax effect of stock awards. Excluding this item, our 2Q '17 effective tax rate would have been approximately 32.9%. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the full year is expected to be approximately 32.5% and somewhat below this level in 3Q '17. As a reminder, our non-GAAP effective tax rate in 3Q '16 was only 29.1% due to the benefit of discrete items. As I mentioned earlier, we expect to continue to see significant year-to-year expansion of adjusted EBITDA margin in 3Q '17, which will drive growth and operating income and adjusted EBITDA at a higher rate than revenue. However, items below operating income, principally the tax benefit in 3Q '16 as well as higher shares outstanding as we have not repurchased shares since the Veda acquisition, negatively impacts 3Q '17 adjusted EPS growth by about 4 percentage points. In 2Q '17, operating cash flow was $225 million and free cash flow was $176 million, both consistent with our expectations. Through June, operating cash flow was $329 million and free cash flow was $229 million, up 10% and 6% respectively. Capital spending incurred in the quarter was $47 million. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $2.8 billion and our leverage was 2.32 times EBITDA. We raised cash in the commercial paper market in the last week of June to allow us to repay $272.5 million of bonds maturing in early July. Excluding the additional $272.5 million in commercial paper used to prefund the bond maturity, leverage would have been 2.1 times EBITDA. As we have delevered from the Veda acquisition consistent with our plans, we will restart share repurchases in 3Q. As Rick indicated, Equifax performance in first half of 2017 has been outstanding with local currency revenue up 11% and adjusted EPS up 14%. As Rick will describe shortly, for the full year, our expectations for both revenue and adjusted EPS are improving versus when we gave guidance in February. At that time, we expected the mortgage market to be down about 15%, principally in the back half of 2017, driven by increasing interest rates. We indicated that we would offset the overall 3% revenue headwind caused by the weakened mortgage market by accelerating new product innovation, accelerating growth in nonmortgage segments of USIS and Workforce Solutions, driven by product innovation as well as improved market conditions as increasing interest rates cause an acceleration in growth of credit card and other nonmortgage markets and continued very good performance from GCS and International. As we look at our current expectations for the full year, we expect to continue the strong performance we have shown to-date, executing on what we had committed. For the full year, we expect NPI continues to be strong. Overall mortgage market revenue decline will be somewhat less than the 15% we expected, and therefore mortgage revenue in USIS and Workforce will be stronger than expected. USIS and EWS nonmortgage revenue will continue to be strong. We expect market conditions to continue to be favorable, but not at the accelerated rate expected earlier in the year as interest rates have not increased as expected. International growth will continue ahead of schedule. GCS revenue growth being weaker-than-expected is now expected to be below our long term 5% to 8% range for the year. Taken together, performance looks to be better than our expectations when we started the year. Now let me turn it back to Rick. Rick Smith : Thanks, John. Let me just give you a little color first on the third quarter and then the full year, then the operator will open up for some questions for all participants. For the third quarter at current exchange rates, we expect revenue to be between $853 million and $861 million, reflecting a growth rate of 6% to 7% with limited FX impact for the quarter. Mortgage market headwinds impact third quarter revenue growth by approximately 300 basis points. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.50 and $1.54, which is up 4% to 7% for the third quarter also with minimal FX impact. Mortgage market headwinds impact adjusted EPS growth by over 500 basis points in the quarter. Also John mentioned earlier, third quarter 2016 had a tax benefit that did not reoccur in third quarter 2017 and that will impact adjusted EPS growth by about 300 basis points. As you know, our long-term growth model of 7% to 10% revenue growth and 11% to 14% adjusted EPS growth, adjusting for the expect mortgage headwinds. Our outlook for both revenue and adjusted EPS for the third quarter is nicely within our long-term model. The full year of 2017 guidance has improved as we've narrowed the range and increased the midpoint, shifting both revenue and adjusted EPS toward the upper end of our previous guidance. At current exchange rates, we expect revenue to end the year between $3.395 billion and $3.425 billion, reflecting constant currency revenue growth for the year of about 9%. We're increasing the bottom end of our range by $20 million in the guidance we had given earlier, which was $3.375 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin for the year to be above 37%, which is up nicely from our previous guidance. We now expect adjusted EPS to be between $6.02 and $6.10, which is up about 10% and up from our earlier guidance of $5.96 to $6.10, and this reflects the high level of execution by the team and the strength of our diversified business model. And this is -- just to refresh your memories, on top of 23% adjusted EPS growth we delivered last year. Within framework of our long-term model and adjusted for mortgage market impact this year, our full year guidance for both revenue and adjusted EPS is also at the high end of our long-term model. So with that, operator, if you could open up for questions, please? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Patrick Halfmann : This is Patrick in for Toni. John, you referenced in your prepared remarks that total mortgage-related revenue was up something like 13% this quarter, while inquiry volumes were down in the high-single digits. I believe you reported a similar level of outperformance last quarter. So I'm just wondering as we think about the third quarter, three point headwind from mortgage and sort of the guide for the back half, whether or not that mortgage guidance might be overly conservative? Rick Smith : Patrick, let me jump in first and then John -- well, this is Rick. The performance you saw, one, we don't think is over conservative, to answer your question. Two is the performances you saw in the second quarter of outperforming the market and market is defined in many different ways, has not been a 1 quarter or 2 quarter or 1 year or 2 year anomaly, it's been long-term trend. So we continue to expect ourselves to outperform whatever the market does. We've given guidance, assuming the mortgage market that I think is pretty consistent with many economists, we expect to outperform that. John Gamble : The big gap you saw in Q2 and Q1 between our performance and market performance, a chunk of it is trended data, right. So we had a nice growth from trended data, which started, as we said, in the third quarter of last year. And so part of that very wide gap is because of trended data revenue. But as Rick said, we'll still outperform the mortgage market as we go forward. Patrick Halfmann : Great. And then a quick follow-up, if I could. I believe in the past, you've talked about Canada as more of a mid-single-digit grower. Given the stronger performance in the first half of this year, I'm wondering if at least over the next couple of quarters, whether or not we should expect that to be more like high single-digit grower. Rick Smith : You get a lot of noise quarter-to-quarter and geography-to-geography. And I don't pay much attention to that. We get great momentum in NPI, great momentum in Cambrian and across many verticals. So you may see quarter-to-quarter something outperforming and some quarter is underperforming, but long term, we still felt very good about being in that mid-single-digit growth as we spoke of high margins. Operator : And we will take our next question from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Greg Bardi : This is Greg calling on for Manav. I appreciate all the color on the mortgage segment. I was just wondering if you could give a little color on how you're thinking about some of the other consumer classes like auto and cars, just given the interest rate backdrop. Rick Smith : I think from macro perspective, with interest rates not rising as maybe the economy had expected earlier in the year, it's not as -- you're not seeing the growth at the macro level maybe in the car business as you would have expected earlier in the year. But we have a wide range -- array of customers, and we've got some that are doing extremely well. You saw the performance in our marketing services, prescreening was really strong in marketing. Auto, even though you're seeing a plateauing of new car sales in the U.S. projecting it will be something over $17 million for the year. As, we participate on used car, Greg, as well as new car. Used car continues to grow. And we talked about our EWS business being lightly penetrated with a lot of room to grow. We signed a great contract with a partner in that arena in the last 6 months. That's continuing to fuel growth. So even though new car sales are plateauing, we continue to expect place like EWS and auto to be a good growth driver for us. Greg Bardi : And then on the fraud and ID side, you sounded pretty excited about the InstaTouch and some of the other things you're doing there. A bunch of your peers have also talked about fraud and ID as being an important growth driver. So I'm just hoping if you could give some color on what you think can be the differentiator for you guys versus the peers? Rick Smith : Well, one, it's important to know, Greg, that we thought about fraud and ID is not just in the U.S. where we have the traditional competitors. It's in countries where we don't have necessarily traditional competitors. You go to Latin America, we plan on bringing fraud and ID we have into those countries. You think about Australia, we're really excited about bringing products like InstaTouch to Australia. So it is a global excitement that you're hearing from us, not just in the U.S. And InstaTouch is very unique. And what makes InstaTouch unique is not just the technology itself and the first mover advantage. And that's one small piece of fraud, by the way. It is also that coupled with our unique data assets that makes InstaTouch really powerful. And by the way, Greg, we also alluded to InstaTouch being a really exciting capability we're bringing to Workforce Solutions. And as you know, Workforce Solutions has the unique capability that we have in our business. Operator : And we will take our next question from George Mihalos from Cowen. George Mihalos : Just wanted to ask, Rick, on the financial marketing again, which historically has kind of been -- if that's strong, it's sort of a harbinger of future growth coming your way. Do you still view that sort of relationship intact, that if you have the prescreen and everything else going up that, that will lead to a bit of an acceleration, if you will, in some near-term revenue? Rick Smith : Good question, George. So the strength, first of all, was in three unique areas. It was the portfolio management, it was prescreen and it's out IXI business, all three exhibited really strong growth. The correlation and connection between prescreen and online, and we talked about this last few years. There seems to be a slight decoupling. It used to almost be a one quarter lag between prescreen growth and an uptick in online. We're not seeing that necessarily that correlation. We're keeping an eye on it going forward. And if it does correlate, obviously, that's nice upside for our online business and USIS. We've not seen that direct correlation for the past few years. George Mihalos : Okay. I appreciate that. And then just I might have missed it, but just your confidence on consumer coming back in the fourth quarter. It just a matter of there was a push out again of some new products, and is that the driver or anything going on in the customer base that might worry you a little bit? Rick Smith : The confidence level, George, is extremely high, and we've got great visibility into contract-level details. And again, if you look at the first half in compared to third quarter, we saw modest growth in the first half, slight decline to flattish in the third quarter. We got that visibility. It gives us high level of confidence that fourth quarter will exit nicely in the range, and that will bode well for 2018. Okay. Operator. Operator : And we will take our next question from Brett Huff from Stephens. Brett Huff : Two quick ones. One, you'll mentioned that you're going to try and get back to doing some buybacks later in the year or in 3Q. On a broader question of capital allocation, how are we still prioritizing things? I know you want to invest a lot organically. But as you look around, is there anything that you're particularly more focused on now inorganically? Rick Smith : Yes. First of all, strategically, Brett, the priority remains the same. It's investing in organic growth, it's protecting the dividend we talked about and it's investing in share repurchase and inorganic growth. As you might guess, we have been focused the last whatever it's been, 18 months or 19 months or so, on the integration of Veda and de-leveraging. So as you think about capital allocation in the back half of this year and going into 2018, John mentioned share repurchase. We're back in that arena and expect us to get back in the arena of acquisitions as well. We do a good job of that and it's tied to our strategy. We've got a good pipeline and we have the financial capacity to do so. Brett Huff : And then second question is when you think about prioritization of sort of the growth opportunities at some -- I know you have a lot of them, but do you think -- do you see a greater opportunity of simply taking the existing products you have in your most developed markets like the U.S. and spreading them around the world to different geos? Or is it do you feel there's more growth opportunity in sort of your NPI and just generating brand new products or maybe there's a balance? Richard Smith : Yes, let me start at a high level and drill down. Number one, if I had to prioritize a single highest growth prospect we have over the next three to five years, it's obviously The Work Number. We alluded to that, that we have had a record number of adds of employers and records to the database. We talked back, I think it was October of last year, that we had a short-term goal of getting 300 million records on that database. We have blown through that number and are over 320 million and we're on our way to 350 million. And you couple that with the penetration of different verticals, you penetrate it's get smarter in that arena and taking that then global. So Work Number is by far the number one area that I see for growth over the next five years in the U.S. and globally. Number two, obviously, NPI is always a very strong part of our growth, and that hits across many verticals and many countries. Categorically, we've talked about fraud being a very, very important market for us. We talked about InstaTouch just a second ago, and that hits all markets. Your comment on moving products around the country, we're getting better at that. That's a big part of what we are. It's cost efficient and it's effective to do. We'll continue to move things like our OSHA platform globally, Cambrian globally. Ignite will be another area in both direct and marketplace. It excites us as we port Cambrian worldwide. And oh yes, and debt services. Debt services. Interesting point in debt services, we tend to talk a lot, and there may be some questions today about Indesser. Debt Services in Indesser that the government in the UK has been a great growth driver for us. And interesting thing is over 50% of our revenue for debt services now comes from opportunities outside of Indesser and roughly 30% to 40% of it is outside of UK all together. We're deploying debt services now in virtually every country we operate around the world, and that's a great driver of growth this year, next year and beyond. Operator : And we will take our next question from Tim McHugh from William Blair. Tim McHugh : You probably explained this, but I may have missed it. I guess what part of consumer underperformed in the second quarter, relative to what you had expected? I think you had said. And then as you think about 2018, can you elaborate on, I guess -- I know you said you have line of sight to specific contracts, but I guess what parts of the business just more qualitatively are you expecting better performance in? Richard Smith : Yes. The miss, Tim, was -- I don't know if I mentioned specifically or not but it was in our direct business. And we're trying to reposition the business as we talked about, before we have four-pronged approach that Dan Adams and his team have been operating on. NPI is a very important part of that, globalization is a very important part of that, working with our indirect partners, getting new indirect partners. So it's not a silver bullet. It's a continuation of repositioning of the business that he's been on now for six to nine months. John, you want to add something? John Gamble : Actually, the biggest area was really consumer direct business and also some of the white label areas just didn't quite show the growth that we expected. And as Rick said, we didn't see the expanded growth through channels and geographies that we had expected we would see in the quarter, and that's just lower than we thought. Rick Smith : And Tim, to reiterate, so we have great transparency. We can look at contract level, customer level, product level, channel level and we wouldn't see replacing. We've got confidence in returning to that long-term growth model in the fourth quarter unless we saw it, and we do see it. Tim McHugh : Okay. And then just some model questions quick. On the debt, that was, I think, fairly expensive debt. So is that just a change in kind of the absolute debt level will run at going forward? Or I guess, will you replace that? Or how should we think about the balance sheet in that regard? I mean just the guidance -- sorry, go ahead. John Gamble : We refinanced it with commercial paper. So the debt level didn't change but the mix of debt did. Tim McHugh : Okay. And the guidance -- the small acquisition you did earlier or at least announced, I don't know if it's closed yet, is that incorporated into this at this point? Rick Smith : It is, but it's extremely small. It is not closed yet, to be clear. The hope is that gets closed sometime here in the third quarter, but it will be de minimis in the third and fourth quarter. More importantly, it's strategically an opportunity for Dan to get in that world of the benefits world and sell and monetize products. So long term, we're very bullish on that, I mean in 2018, but 2017, yes, it's in our guidance but it's de minimis. Operator : And we will take our next question from Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets. Gunnar Hansen : This is Gunnar Hansen in for Gary. I just want to touch base. I guess going back to Veda, you guys cited the onetime project making for a tough comp last year. I guess any sense as to how big that was? And I guess, just the underlying growth in Australia and Veda in particular? And any particular product or verticals that are seeing strong growth or maybe a little more insight there? Rick Smith : Yes, it was -- by the way, the guidance we gave in the second quarter, obviously, we have full transparency in the onetime contract we had last year. So it was not a surprise on our end. Two, we remain very bullish on Australia and Asia as a whole. It can end the year with great growth. It will have a great third quarter and have a great fourth quarter. Well positioned for next year. Economic outlook remains very good for Australia. The consensus is 2.3 4 5 6 7% growth next year. Paulino, as I mentioned, is down there if he'll accelerate the adoption of some of our platforms and products and processes. So I remain very bullish on the entire region. John Gamble : We also said that we're going to see for the last 9 months of 2017 growth in the high-single digits, so that includes the second quarter. And that high-single digit is at the high end of the range we indicated we'd see for Veda when we acquired them. So again, we feel very good. Gunnar Hansen : Okay. And then, I guess, just you guys, I think, in December announced the enterprise-wide agreement with Silicon Valley firm. It -- has that driven a meaningful contribution to revenues? And has that established or driven any new partnerships that you guys have been working on? Rick Smith : Gunnar, the latter is the more important. As we talked about, it's a nice revenue contributor. But more importantly, it gives us the kind of the cache, the credibility in the digital market space, and we're seeing the benefit of that. Operator : And we will take our next question from Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust. Andrew Jeffrey : Couple of questions for you. I guess, first of all, Rick, it's good to hear that Verifier is enjoying new vertical growth. Can you talk a little bit about how penetrated you think you are at some of those new verticals and how long the runway might be for sustainable growth in that subsegment of EWS? Rick Smith : Yes. Andrew, it's amazing. I say this all the time. It is -- one, the visibility into the long-term growth is phenomenal. Meaning we see the levers that we can pull to continue to grow. If I look out 5 years, I see significant growth over the next 5 years for that business just in the U.S. alone and it could even be longer. And then you say growth, planting the seeds we're planting in Canada, Australia, U.K. gives you confidence in growth for years to come even after that. So vertical penetration, expansion, I think there's a whole new world of things we can do in that entire employer space and HR space that is yet to be tapped. So I'm extremely bullish. It's been hell of a run for us since we bought that company 10 years ago. On the revenue side, on the profit side is converting the model from a BPO model to a data and analytics and insight model is remarkable. And it shows through, as you know, in the top line as well as the margin expansion. So I mean, it would not be farfetched to say that in a period of time, that may be our largest, most profitable business we have in the world. Andrew Jeffrey : Okay. I mean, that's exciting. And obviously, there are lots of moving pieces still around ACA. But given what you know today or where you think we are in the potential legislative process, barring, say, a full repeal of ACA, it sounds like EWS is a business that could grow above your current long-term trends for some time. Is it reasonable to expect that as we get clarity, you might be upping those targets? Rick Smith : Right now, we're assuming that there is continued headwind around ACA. And if that changes, if there's no repeal and no replacement, obviously, that bodes well for the analytics business within EWS. John Gamble : But as an example, for the second half an employer we're expecting to see the whole employer business to grow nicely in the second half of the year, right. So kind of high single-digit range. So we've not only seen good growth in Verifier, we're seeing good growth in employer as well, and that's with a flat FWA business. Andrew Jeffrey : Okay. So anything short of full repeal could be an incremental positive, maybe in the way you're thinking about that business right now? Rick Smith : Yes. I think so that would be more for 2018 rather than 2017. Andrew Jeffrey : Right. Okay. So hopefully, we'll have clarity by then. Operator : And we will take our next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Shlomo Rosenbaum : John, why aren't we seeing like an uptick in the minority interest as Indesser is doing better? Or shouldn't we start to see that increase more? John Gamble : So minority interest generally scales with the performance of our International property because we have partners in many of our International properties around the world. So what you should see -- it doesn't tie perfectly because it -- obviously, the performance of different countries varies in any individual quarter. But in general, as you see, International growing more aggressively, you're going to see minority interest continue to go up as well. And we take that into account in our EBITDA calculation. Shlomo Rosenbaum : So you're saying that there's more than just Indesser in there? John Gamble : Absolutely. We have partners in multiple Latin American countries, in Spain, in Russia. So we have partners in many places around the world. Generally speaking, they have relatively small percentages, but yes, we have partners in many of our businesses around the world. Rick Smith : And Shlomo, that's not new. We've had those partnerships for a long time. In many cases, long as my tenure here; in some cases like Russia where it's occurring since we've been there, but that's not a new phenomena for us. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Right. I'm just wondering, is that what we should expect though over the next year or so that we should see this line item expand as Indesser does better? John Gamble : Well, the line item will expand in general as International does better, right, because the partnerships are broader than just Indesser, right. And the impact of minority interest is really driven by improvements in Argentina, in Chile, in Spain and in other parts of the world where we have Peru or where we have partners. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. And then can you give us a little bit of order of magnitude between the variance in the mortgage services line item and kind of the MBA applications index that was down like almost 18.5%? How much of that was that -- the trended data and how much of it was the fact that you guys generally are working hard to outperform the market? John Gamble : So we focus on different measures. So as we indicated, second quarter increase was down high-single digits and we'll probably try to variance off of that. Historically what you've seen is Equifax has outperformed the overall mortgage market by 5, 6, 7, 8 points, right. So that's kind of what the historical -- it looks like historically. It moves around quarter-to-quarter, but that's been historical move. Again, as we said, we've done much better than that for the past four quarters, and it's something that's because of trended data. Also you're seeing, as Rick mentioned, a continued improved penetration in Workforce Solutions, and that continues to drive outperformance relative to the mortgage market in general. And that, we believe, has legs for quite some time as well as new products continually being added by USIS. Operator : And we will take our next question from Jeff Mueller from Baird. Jeff Meuler : Just on the global consumer side, I guess, as the DTC component and then slower than planned on the geographic and NPI. So in terms of the -- I hear you loud and clear on the confidence for Q4. When you talk about delays, is it a delay where you're slower to get into a market? Or is it a delay where once you're in market, there's a slower rate of market adoption? And then on the DTC side for Q4, are you assuming kind of a stabilization in the year-over-year trend? Or is there some assumption that it could continue to worsen and you can still get to the growth you're talking about? Rick Smith : Yes, Jeff, it's largely a stabilization on DTC. And really, the slowness was not as geographic expansion in new geographies, but it might be taking products into new geographies and products into existing geographies. So to be honest, that was an execution mostly around NPI within GCS. But to your question, we do expect DTC to slow, stabilize in the fourth quarter. And again, the confidence level is very high that we'll be back in that range. Jeff Meuler : And then the Verification Services growth was phenomenal in this mortgage environment. I think that you said that mortgage grew, and I understand the growth is broad-based, but can you just confirm that that's the case? And where are you in terms of mortgage penetration within Verification? John Gamble : Well, we indicated that we gave our growth rate for mortgage for all of Equifax, and we think we said up 13%, right. So I can confirm that's correct. And in terms of penetration for mortgage in the GCS, in the Workforce Solutions business, I think we believe we still have a long way to go, right. Our penetration continues to grow, but as we continue to add more records, the hit rate continues to go up substantially, so our opportunities to generate revenue off mortgage from the Workforce Solutions business is substantial. Rick Smith : That's key. Operator : And we will take our next question from Kevin McVeigh from Deutsche Bank. Kevin McVeigh : I wonder if you could give us a sense, given the success you've had on the trended data side on mortgage, does it make it an easier transition to other parts of the business, and thus, even kind of quicker acceleration, if you would, across auto and consumer credits, so on and so forth? Or was it just the power that data speaks for itself? Richard Smith : It's a lot of it, Kevin. It's every vertical. We're excited. And to be very clear, we're excited about the opportunity to trend data. We're trending data right now in different verticals in different parts of the world. But every case has got a stand on its own merits. The KS list and the value you get. In auto, in a particular country, it got to stand on its own. The fact you've got a success in mortgage market has no real bearing on the adoption in that new vertical in that new country, but we're excited short term and long term about trended data. Kevin McVeigh : And then, Rick, could you just remind us the mix in new versus used in the auto side, I mean given the growth and things like that. Just is it pretty similar in terms of where the revenue sits new versus used? Richard Smith : We don't break that out, but we play in both. That's what you need to know. So we are -- any time a car is financing, whether used we're there to play on verification of income, verification of employment and credit and credit score. So we're agnostic. Operator : And we will take our next question from Andrew Steinerman from J. P. Morgan. Andrew Steinerman : It's Andrew. I just wanted to clarify and check on the Employer Services within Workforce Solutions. I definitely appreciate the outlook. I'm just talking about the second quarter. Was the decline solely related to ACA analytics? Or is there anything else to discuss? John Gamble : The decline was specific to ACA analytics, right. Other than -- if you exclude the Workforce Analytics business, we had growth of over 5% and the remainder of Employer. Richard Smith : Thank you, Andrew. Okay with that, operator, we will terminate the call. I appreciate everybody's time and interest in Equifax, and have a good day. Operator : And this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect.",

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Dodge. Please go ahead. Jeff Dodge : Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to today's conference call. I am Jeff Dodge, Investor Relations. And with me today are Paulino Barros, Chief Executive Officer; John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer; and Doug Brandberg of Investor Relations. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com. During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2016 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. Also we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA margin, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance for the third quarter of 2017. Adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes acquisition-related amortization; the income tax effects of stock awards recognized upon vesting or settlement; and certain costs related to the cybersecurity incident, including cost to investigate and remediate the cybersecurity incident; legal and professional services; and the contingent liability for cost associated with providing free credit file monitoring and identity theft protection services to consumers. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as net income attributable to Equifax, adding back income tax expense, interest expense, net of interest income, depreciation and amortization, and also excludes certain onetime items, including the costs related to the cybersecurity incident. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our website. Now I'd like to turn it over to Paulino. Paulino Barros : Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I and the entire Equifax organization apologize to the individuals whose personal information was stolen as well as to our customers, partners, investors, ministers and other constituents who were disrupted by the cybersecurity incident at Equifax. Last month, when I was named Interim CEO, I told you we'd act to quickly in our efforts to support consumers in strengthening our security and IT infrastructure. I believe we have made good progress in these areas. In my remarks today, I will discuss these critical areas of focus as well as provide more detail on the near- and long-term actions we are taking. I will close with comments on where I believe we as a, company and the industry, should be heading. John will walk you through the results of the \u2013 for the third quarter, including the cost of cybersecurity incident as well as provide a view of fourth quarter 2017 expectations. In terms of the status of our investigation into the cybersecurity incident, the forensic investigation regarding the attacker activity within Equifax environment is complete. And we understand what occurred and the extent of the intrusion. The company as well as the special committee of the Board of Directors continue to investigate all aspects of the incident, and these are important inputs to us change \u2013 for the changes we are making. Being a trusted steward of the information entrusted to Equifax has long been one of the core principles. We have invested aggressively, particularly over the past 5 years in security and network resilience. Nevertheless, the security incident occurred, and with it, the need for fundamental change. Our near-term focus, as we move through the remainder of this year, is principally in several critical areas. First, improving the support we are providing to all consumers, particularly those impacted by the cybersecurity incident. The free TrustedID Premier service we have offered to all Americans provides a strong suite of credit monitoring and identity theft protection services. Although we certainly accept responsibility for the difficulties related to obtaining this service when it was initially launched on September 8, we believe we have made and will continue to make substantial improvements to the accessibility and performance of this service. To ensure any consumer who wants this service has the ability to enroll. We have extended the enrollment period to the end of January 2018 and also extended a period for which we will offer free credit freezes to the same date. We have made significant improvements in our application process' performance. And currently, consumers wishing to enroll can in general do so in a matter of minutes. In our call centers, we had over 3,000 agents. And more than five times increase in average wait times have dropped to less than a minute, with many being serviced without waiting. There's two instances of consumers' frustration, circumstances where wait times are too long or issues are not handled quickly or properly. We are working to resolve this as rapidly as we can. Equifax employees globally understand it's our obligation to provide best possible service to consumers. In U.S., we are making every effort to continue to improve the TrustedID Premier Service. We are also providing similar services to impacted U.K. and Canadian consumers. Second, ensuring we're taking significant actions to protect the consumer and commercial data that has been entrusted to us around the world. This incident requires a revisit to our entire IT and data security practice, including engaging industry experts to support the effort. After a comprehensive top-down review with Megan and PwC, we have taken immediate steps to improve our data security infrastructure. We are hardening our networks, changing our procedures to require close-looped confirmation when software patches are applied, rolling out new vulnerability scanning tools and processes and increasing accountability mechanisms for our security and IT team members. We have also engaged PwC to assist us with our security program, including strategic remediation and transformation initiative that will help us identify and implement solutions in the future, so to strengthening our long-term data protection and cybersecurity posture. We're also working to bolster our security culture throughout the entire company. Data security will be a mandatory responsibility for all Equifax employees, whether or not they're members of our security or IT teams. Since taking this position, I have spoken to our employees at multiple town hall meetings about the absolute necessity of solid security practice and the critical importance of protecting consumer information. I have revised our corporate governance structure so that Equifax's Chief Security Officer reports directly to me, ensuring greater accountability of this critical function. I have created a Chief Transformation Officer position, also reporting to me, who will receive the company's response to the cybersecurity incident and coordinate our efforts to build our new future. This will allow me to have directly insight into every aspect of our remediation and transformation efforts. Third, we're working with customers, partners and data contributors to help them understand the incident more fully and the actions we have and are taking to improve our IT systems and data security. Equifax's historic success was built on the trust of our customers placed in us to help them solve difficult business problems with unique data and analytical assets. This was, of course, predicated on their trust on our IT and data security capabilities. Over the past 2 months, we have been working closely with customers worldwide to address their questions on the security incident and our IT and data security infrastructure and capabilities. Our goal is to be as transparent as possible, and we'll be continuing offer efforts in this area over the coming weeks. Our customers are also providing assistance by sharing their views of best practices for our integrated cybersecurity program. We're also working to monitor for the use of stolen personal identifiable information being used for fraudulent transactions. And to date, we do not have any evidence linking fraudulent problem activity to data stolen from Equifax. Our customers have been generous with their time and willing to work with us. The business units with the most direct impact from the incident were U.S. Information Solutions, the Global Consumer Solutions as well as Workforce Solutions. In USIS, as expected, we saw deferrals of customers' decisions regarding the purchase of new products or discrete products and services in third quarter and fourth quarter to date. Within USIS, Online and Marketing Services, which delivers a large online market data project, bore the brunt of the impact. We have seen little evidence to share shift. And to the extent it was occurred, it has been very limited. We continue to see customers engage in business discussions and have closed some important contract renewals and extensions since the incident was announced. Similar to USIS, Workforce Solutions is also seeing deferrals of customers' decisions regarding the purchase of discrete products and service impact its revenue from both government and commercial customers. This impact for Workforce Solutions was not meaningful in the third quarter, but is expected to impact revenue growth in the fourth quarter. GCS revenue was not meaningfully impacted in the quarter. However, the subscriber base was impacted by churn and a substantial reduction in customer additions, as we effectively stopped all the direct-to-consumer advertising and cross-sell activities. As we discuss our fourth quarter outlook, we will see this impact accelerate. John will provide more details on the specific revenue impacts in the third and what we expect for the fourth quarter. We also continue to work closely with our data consumers, and to date, have not seen \u2013 only very limited have not \u2013 have seen only limited impacts across the U.S. businesses. It's important to remember that none of our credit bureaus or Workforce Solution data assets were impacted by the cybersecurity incident. Fourth, responding and working with the government and other regulatory bodies as they assess the impact of the incident. We have received requests for information and subpoenas for a number of United States and Federal regulatory agencies and several regulatory agencies outside of U.S. In each case, we are cooperating with agencies to provide the requested information. We are also working proactively to brief the appropriate parties about the progress of our investigation in consumer remediation efforts. We hope to reearn the trust of consumers and the government bodies charged with protecting those consumers. Clearly, this incident has emphasized the need for Equifax to give consumers the ability to control access to personal credit data. We plan to launch our lock-and-alert service on January 31, 2018, which we will offer to all U.S. consumers for free for life. This service allow consumers to lock and unlock their Equifax credit file directly and quickly from their mobile device or a computer. Finally, we have committed to working with the entire industry to develop solutions to the growing cybersecurity and data protection challenges. We believe the time is right for an industry-wide solution that provides consumers to substantially improve visibility and control to personal credit data for free for life. We believe this is a turning point for everyone interested in protecting personal data. Due to the impact of the cybersecurity incident, we have decided that the Equifax senior leadership team, my direct reports and I, will receive no incentive compensation in 2017. In order to accelerate execution of all these key initiatives, I have refocused a substantial portion of the \u2013 our EGI and Lean teams on these key initiatives. In addition to improving execution, it will rapidly expand the understanding of the integrated security framework we are deploying across the organization. As we focus intensely on these mission-critical actions, we must ensure we do not lose focus on executing our core strategic initiatives, including the critical processes that have driven our success over the past 10 years. John will provide you details on the performance of the business segment this quarter, but I will take you through progress on NPI and a few key new products. Prior to the cybersecurity incident, Equifax had earned a strong reputation for operational execution. This was delivered through a consistent cadency of well-planned business processes. As I have already stated, we will utilize these processes in our overall governance to ensure it is a strong enabler of the integrated IT and data security strategy being developed. It is important that we get back to executing under this operating cadence as we will ensure the execution of our IT and data security events as well as our long-term growth strategy. The growth engine will continue to be New Product Innovation. Year-to-date, NPI revenues in our Vitality Index are ahead of our targets and also ahead of 2016 levels. This year, we expect to launch over 7 new products, roughly 30% more than 2016 \u2013 than in 2016. Although we expect the cybersecurity incident to impact the revenue on new products in USIC in the near term, we will continue to focus on maintaining a strong phase of new product launches. Also, we remain bullish on many of the critical new products we have discussed with you this year. Cambrian in our Ignite portfolio of solutions continued to be differentiators for Equifax. The diversity of our unique data with lending analytics \u2013 leading analytics, including artificial intelligence, provide the capability unmatched in our industry. Ignite Direct allow customer data scientists to work directly with our diverse data assets, including trended data and combining their own data to define new solutions to their business problems. Ignite allow business analysis using predefined configurable to highly customized solutions that again leverage Equifax's broad and unique data assets. We are seeing numerous requests to proof-of-concepts, and early results are well ahead of targets. We continue to move ahead with developments, deployments of the Cambrian data analytics platforms and the associated portfolio of Ignite solutions powered by the platform across the U.S. and Canada as well as Australia, New Zealand, and by the end of 2018, to Europe, Argentina, Chile and Peru. We continue to move ahead with our InstaTouch family of mobile solutions. As a reminder, InstaTouch provides a single method to confirm the identity of the user of a mobile device, and then for that user, to use Equifax data assets to securely repopulate information to complete an application or a purchase. This unique offering will be utilized globally as we continue to roll out more solutions to the InstaTouch family. These include InstaTouch ID, a customer acquisition service, which removes friction from the process of applying, ordering and rolling or buying and helps business personalize their consumers' or employees' experience. InstaTouch Pay, a frictionless means of providing e-wallet capabilities. And InstaTouch Offers, which leverage our secure prescreen of loan capability and delivers personalized contextual offers. We've been gaining good traction with InstaTouch. And up and running with several key retailers, we expect InstaTouch to be a strong contributor to NPI over the next 3 years. An enabler to our integrated IT and data security service as well as our NPI initiatives is a continuing investment and deployment of our global technology platforms such as Cambrian and InterConnect. And we are very excited about the long-term opportunity to leverage successes across our global footprint, including building a Workforce Solutions business in Canada and over time expanding to U.K. and Australia. Looking at the overall market conditions. In U.S., we expect the overall trend in GDP to remain in the low 2% range in 2017, with slight strengthening in 2018. Consumer credit continues to be relatively healthy. And in terms of growth trends by segment, we continue to expect mortgage to be down double digits year-over-year in the fourth quarter 2017, with refi down significantly. Mortgage and home equity delinquencies continue to decline. In auto, the market is essentially flat, with new car sales down slightly, offset by modest growth in used cars. Bank card originations have slowed this year, following double-digit growth last year. With delinquency rates for auto and car had uptick recently, they remain well below levels seen during the recession. Overall lending continues to be relatively healthy with strong underwriting standards. Outside the U.S., we expect continued strengthening in the economies in Australia and our 2 largest markets in Latin America, Argentina and Chile. We expect a low single-digit GDP growth in the U.K. to be fairly flat looking forward. In Canada, we expect continued GDP growth over 2%, although some slowing from the 2.5% GDP growth in 2017. I have every confidence that Equifax will execute the critical delivers I covered today. We'll be a better company tomorrow and into the future, more focused and delivering great services to consumers with leading industry focus in security integrated in every aspect of our business. The foundation of our business is to be based on our dedicated and committed people, our core capabilities, differentiated assets and great processes that allow us to deliver great value for our customers and return to our shareholders, just as we have been doing for the past decade. With that, let me hand it over to John. John Gamble : Thank you, Paulino, and good morning, everyone. As before, I will generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis. Our non-GAAP results for the quarter exclude the onetime costs related to the cybersecurity incident. We will provide details on these costs, so you can consider them in your analysis. Our earnings release this quarter was several weeks after our normal timing to allow us to more fully complete our investigation of the incident and the impact on our results. Total revenue for the quarter was $835 million, up 4% on a reported basis and up 3% on a local currency basis from Q3 2016. For the quarter, FX was a $3 million benefit. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 37.4%, up 150 basis points. Adjusted EPS was $1.53, up 6%. In the quarter, we estimate that the cybersecurity incident negatively impacted total company revenue by 1% to 2% of sales, principally in the U.S. We have not seen a material negative impact on revenues from the increase in consumers freezing or locking their credit file to date. Prior to the September 7 announcement, approximately 0.5% of Equifax credit files were locked or frozen. Since then, we have seen an increase in volume in the number of locks and freezes placed by consumers, and the total files locked or frozen currently represent about 1.5% to 2% of all Equifax credit files. Approximately 15% to 20% are locks, and the rest are state-filed freezes. In addition, the incentive compensation accrual in 3Q '17 was much lower than anticipated, benefiting earnings by over $0.07 per share. Due to the cybersecurity incident, the senior leadership team will not receive incentive compensation in 2017, and the impact on performance and the net costs related to the incident will reduce incentive attainment. In 3Q, we incurred a onetime charge related to the cybersecurity incident of $87.5 million. These costs were included in our non-GAAP adjustments. $27.3 million of costs for the \u2013 for third-party services provided principally in the investigation of the cybersecurity incident. These costs were generally for legal, cyber forensic investigations and other professional services. $60.2 million in accrued expenses related to the free TrustedID service we have offered to all U.S. citizens. This represents the lower end of our estimated range of costs for providing this service of $60.2 million to $110 million. As you know, we offered all U.S. residents TrustedID Premier, a free service, which includes unlimited Equifax credit reports, 3-Bureau credit file monitoring, the ability to lock your Equifax credit report, social security number monitoring and identity theft insurance. Consumers can sign up for this free service until January 31, 2018. Equifax does have insurance to cover costs in connection with the data breach incidents with limits in excess of the current amount of the onetime cost incurred in the third quarter, subject to the terms, conditions and exclusions of the policies. We are currently in discussions with our insurers regarding the cybersecurity incident. As a reminder, as our 4Q '17 filings will be made after the completion of the sign-up period for the free TrustedID service, we should have a good estimate when we release full year results of the cost to be incurred in servicing all consumers. Now let's look at the results of the business units. USIS revenue in 3Q '17 was $308 million, down 3% when compared to the third quarter of 2016. USIS saw the largest impact from the cybersecurity incident. We estimate the negative impact on USIS revenue was 3% to 4% in the quarter. Online Information Solutions revenue was $221 million, down 4% when compared to the year-ago period. This decline reflects the mortgage market decline and the impact of the cybersecurity incident deferring new business activity. Total mortgage market inquiries weakened again in the third quarter, declining by double digits versus 3Q '16, consistent with our expectations. Total mortgage-related revenue for USIS was down 3%, and total mortgage-related revenue for Equifax was down 2%. While we lapped the launch of trended data in August, which helped deliver overperformance versus the market in recent quarters, the team continued to deliver revenue performance favorable to overall mortgage market growth in Q3. Equifax outperformed the overall market, reflecting the partial period benefit from trended data as well as continued strong performance in Workforce Solutions. We expect to continue double-digit decline in mortgage market inquiries in the fourth quarter. Financial Marketing Services revenue was $48 million in 3Q '17, down 1%. Revenues in this segment tend to be project-oriented, and this was the portion of the USIS business most significantly impacted by the cybersecurity incident as transactions expected in the period were delayed into 2018. Excluding the impact of the cybersecurity incident, USIS was slightly weaker than expected, reflecting weaker-than-expected sales in the automotive segment and weakness in commercial. The adjusted EBITDA margin for USIS was 49.2%, down 140 basis points from the 50.6% in 3Q '16. The lower margins principally reflect the decline in revenue in the quarter. Workforce Solutions revenue was $186 million in the quarter, up 9% when compared to 3Q 2016. Verification Services revenue was $130 million, up 13% as we continue to increase our penetration in verticals. Employer Services revenue of $57 million was flat versus last year. Excluding Workforce Analytics, Employer Services growth was about 3%, at the low end of our long-term growth expectations, driven by growth in onboarding. Workforce Analytics, our business that helps employers stay in compliance with the Affordable Care Act, was down double digits in Q3 and was weaker than we expected. The lack of clarity around the ACA has made revenues in Workforce Analytics difficult to forecast. Given current trends, we expect WFA to be down again in 4Q '17. As Paulino indicated, Workforce Solutions in 4Q '17 has seen a revenue impact from the cybersecurity incident, specifically deferrals of customer decisions on purchase of discrete products. Although not meaningful in 3Q, this will actually reduce revenue growth and margin expansion in 4Q. Workforce Solutions' adjusted EBITDA margin was 48.6% in 3Q '16, up 160 basis points from 47% in 3Q '16. International revenue was $240 million in 3Q '17, up 12% on a reported basis and up 10% on a local currency basis. Growth was broad-based, with strong performance across all regions. Europe's revenue was $69 million in 3Q '17, up 11% in U.S. dollars and up 10% in local currency. U.S. \u2013 Europe had several nice wins in the quarter across multiple verticals, including financial, telco and auto. Asia Pacific revenue was $81 million, up 10% in U.S. dollars and up 6% in local currency. Latin America's revenue was $55 million in 3Q '17, up 16% in U.S. dollars and up 20% in local currency. The Latin America team continues to deliver very strong, broad-based performance with double-digit local currency growth in multiple geographies, including 2 of our largest, Argentina and Chile. Canada's revenue was $35 million, up 11% in U.S. dollars and up 7% in local currency. The team continued to win new business, including in the auto vertical. International's adjusted EBITDA margin was 33.2% in 3Q '17, up from 28.4% a year ago. Canada continues with nice margin performance. All other regions showed nice margin expansion in the quarter. 3Q '17 EBITDA margins were very strong. 4Q '17 EBITDA margins are expected to decline from the level seen in 3Q '17. Global Consumer Solutions revenue at $101 million in 3Q '17 was flat on a reported basis and on a local currency basis. The cybersecurity incident did not have a meaningful impact on GCS in the quarter. Our consumer direct business in the U.S. saw a limited negative impact due to increased churn as subscriber additions were limited in the quarter. We stopped substantially all consumer direct advertising and sales activities after the cybersecurity incident. The consumer direct business is expected to be negatively impacted by these factors in 4Q '17. This was offset by slightly better-than-expected revenue performance with some partners and resellers. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.9% in 3Q '17. In the third quarter, corporate expense was $135 million. Excluding the cost associated with the cybersecurity incident, general corporate expense was about $47 million. Our GAAP effective tax rate was 26.1% in the quarter and includes a $4.8 million benefit from the income tax effect of stock awards. Excluding these items, our 3Q '17 effective tax rate would have been approximately 30.6%. As a reminder, our non-GAAP effective tax rate in 3Q '16 was 29.1% due to the benefit of multiple discrete items. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for 4Q '17 and for the full year is expected to be about 32%. In 3Q '17, operating cash flow was $280 million and free cash flow was $222 million, up 14% and 12% for the quarter, respectively. Through September, operating cash flow was $609 million and free cash flow was $451 million, up 12% and 9%, respectively. Capital spending incurred in the quarter was $56 million. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $2.7 billion, and our leverage was 2.32x EBITDA. On our last call, we had indicated that we would begin repurchasing shares in the third quarter. We repurchased approximately $77 million in shares in 3Q '17. However, given the cybersecurity incident, we have again suspended share repurchase activities. We do not intend to repurchase shares in 4Q '17. Before I hand it back to Paulino for some closing comments, let me update you on our guidance for 4Q '17. As we look to the \u2013 at the fourth quarter, we expect to incur significant onetime costs related to the cybersecurity incident, including legal and other professional fees related to the continuation of the investigation and reporting of the cybersecurity incident, cost of free services being provided to consumers and significant accelerated spend in IT and security concentrated in 4Q '17 and early 2018. We're excluding these onetime costs, a significant majority of which are third-party costs, including the accelerated spend in IT and security from our 4Q '17 non-GAAP guidance. We expect these costs to be in the range of $60 million to $75 million in 4Q '17, so you can use this number in your planning. As I referenced earlier, due to the cybersecurity event, Equifax incentive compensation accruals for 2017 reflect no payment of incentive compensation to the senior leadership team. And the net cost of the incident will negatively impact incentive compensation attainment. With that understanding, here's our guidance for Q4. For 4Q '17, at current exchange rates, we expect revenue to be between $825 million and $835 million, reflecting growth of 3% to 4%, with about a 1% benefit from FX. Mortgage market headwinds impact total revenue by about 2%. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.32 and $1.38 with approximately $0.01 of FX benefit. We expect the security incident to negatively impact revenue by 3% to 4%. The largest impacts will be in USIS and GCS, with EWS also impacted, but to a somewhat lesser degree. In USIS, we expect to continue to seek transaction deferrals as we continue to work with customers to complete their reviews following the incident. In GCS, we expect our consumer direct revenue to be negatively impacted by customer churn. EWS is also being impacted by customer deferrals of discrete product and service transactions from both government and commercial services \u2013 customers, sorry. Looking at the business units. USIS revenue will decline slightly versus 4Q '17, reflecting the mortgage market decline and the impact of the cybersecurity incident. Workforce Solutions' year-over-year growth will decline versus the level achieved in 3Q '17, principally reflecting the impact of cybersecurity incident. GCS revenue will decline mid-single-digit percent. Reflecting the impact of the cybersecurity incident, this revenue decline will also impact GCS margins. International is expected to continue to perform well. However, revenue growth and EBITDA margins will be below the levels achieved in 3Q '17. Our guidance reflect the decline in EBITDA margins in 4Q '17 versus prior year. GCS EBITDA margins are expected to decline versus 4Q '16, reflecting the decline in consumer direct revenue. USIS EBITDA margins will also be down somewhat versus 4Q '16 due to the impact of both the cybersecurity incident and a weak mortgage market. EWS EBITDA margins are expected to be about flat versus 4Q '17 \u2013 4Q '16. We will provide more information on 2018, including information on the expected increase in IT and security ongoing costs, on our 4Q '17 earnings conference call. Now let me hand it back to Paulino for some final comments. Paulino Barros : Thanks, John. I want to reiterate our commitment to the consumer and to our customers and partners. We'll deliver on the commitments we have made to provide greater visibility and control to consumers and for Equifax to become a leader in integrated IT and security areas \u2013 data security areas. As we deliver this, I strongly believe we will be a stronger company and our culture of innovation and execution will again allow us to deliver differentiated solution to our customers that drove the Equifax business model over the past 10 years. Finally, I want to thank the incredible, resilient employees of Equifax. Their efforts to support consumers, our customers and Equifax in general are greatly appreciated by me, our leadership team and the board. And with that, operator, we'll now open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Manav Patnaik : Thank you, good morning gentlemen. Appreciate the color you gave on 4Q '17 and so forth. My first question was just around the network security and the spend that you've accelerated. I was just hoping for 2 things. One was the \u2013 some anecdotal color on how much more you're going to spend on it, maybe some areas you're going to spend on it, just to get some more comfort around another repeat incident basically? John Gamble : Yes. So in the script, we indicated that in the fourth quarter, we expected about $60 million to $75 million worth of cost just in the fourth quarter alone. And of that amount specific to the security actions that you're talking about, it's probably on the order of 1/3 of that. And then obviously, there'll also be increased spending as we move into 2018. But the immediate spending is on the order of 1/3 of that. Manav Patnaik : And I guess, just the areas, just in terms of what you learn from why this mistake happened, like is it just overall or a particular area that you'll be focusing on? Paulino Barros : As I mentioned in my top-down review, in my speech here, we have done a comprehensive, top-down review of \u2013 with the help of PwC and we're strengthening \u2013 the approach has been to strengthen the entire operations in this aspect, right, from detection capabilities and processes, the tools, updating the tools and innovating the tools that we have to enhance our detection capabilities. And we will continue and there's more. I think that when we have an event of this nature, we need to make \u2013 we need to stop and make sure that we have \u2013 review the entire process. And we do this in 2 steps. First, we want to make sure that our current capabilities are up to speed and able to respond to these attacks; and second, to design the future stake that we're going to have in the company. Manav Patnaik : Okay. And then just one last one from me. You talked about \u2013 you talked a lot about customer deferrals into 2018. Just curious if your thoughts around what customers are telling you in terms of your confidence that they will come back in 2018 and do that business with you? Paulino Barros : I think that mostly, we didn't lose any contracts that we have today. I have met several customers through this process. And it's definitely an issue that we have \u2013 they have visibility on the road map and our implementation and the things we want to do in the security area. We've been very actually grateful that I have been able to share with their Chief Security Officers some insights on how we should project and design our new systems. We \u2013 what we had in Q3, in the USIS mostly, was some deferral \u2013 new projects that they have with us. They want to make sure that our security systems are in line with their expectations. And we're expecting it. As we demonstrate and share our experiences with them, which is going to happen in the next couple of weeks, they'll be able to understand what we're doing and naturally just will come back into a normal cycle of business. John Gamble : Bottom line is we continue to work through with the customers. We're hoping to win back their trust and then be able to regain the business that we've indicated has been deferred, and we're still working through that process. Operator : And your next question comes from George Mihalos with Cowen. Georgios Mihalos : Great. Thanks. Good morning guys. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the tenor of the conversations with some of your large USIS customers, if that has started to improve a little bit or maybe changed a little bit as you've gone through the quarter? And then also, when the intrusion was first announced, Equifax was adamant that over the long term, realizing that this is off the table near term, but over the long term that the growth algorithm that you had set out, the 6 to 8 on the top line and sort of the low double-digit EPS growth, that, that was still on the table. Do you feel any differently about that now, again looking out over the long term, not for '18? John Gamble : Yes. So again, if \u2013 and I think Paulino addressed this in his script, right? What we indicated is that we think the basic capability of the company has in terms of focusing on diversity of assets and strength of analytics, the historic ability to deliver value to customers by delivering that analytics. And I think what we indicated is, to the extent we're able to work through this issue and regain the trust of customers and improve the strength of our security systems and our IT systems, then those fundamental capabilities still exist. And if they do, we can continue to deliver that value to customers. If we do that, that was the basis of our business model. In terms of specific numbers, no, we're not in a position to talk about specific numbers about our long-term model, and it wouldn't be appropriate at this point. Right now, the focus is on dealing with the IT and security incident and dealing with consumers as we promised that we would. Paulino Barros : Just to add a comment on the customer side. We have a range of customers that I talked to, a number of them. Some customers have been very, very endorsing, very supportive, helping us, giving us insights in order to do a very, very level a lot of conversations out there in front of the customers. my direction has been, let's go and make sure that we are in front of the customers and get their input and feedback on how the things proceed going forward. Again, it has been in the fabric and DNA of this company, execution, and we'll continue to do so. We'll continue to expand our data asset. We'll continue to innovate and have added value to our customers. This is not going to go away, and this would be the basics of what we have in our business model. Georgios Mihalos : Great. I appreciate the color. And just as a quick follow-up, if we look at the Workforce Solutions, the deferrals that you're seeing there, is \u2013 are they skewing more on the government side versus the corporate side? Or would you say that, that's been sort of broad-based? John Gamble : It's probably more broad-based. If you think about the parts of that business where we do more, call it, discrete activities, it tends to be more on the Employer Services side. But I would say it's more broad-based. It certainly touches government, but also it touches commercial customers. Georgios Mihalos : Thanks guys. Operator : And your next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Toni Kaplan : Hi, good morning. From your guidance comments, it sounds like you expect USIS to be down in fourth quarter, but really more from mortgage than from these purchasing delays that you've highlighted as a result of the breach. So I just wanted to make sure that, that's a fair characterization. And so basically, you're saying I think that you can reassure these customers to do new projects with you in the immediate future. And so I wanted to just get a sense of have there been any customers that you've been able to convince so far? And in general, just how long does a typical audit take? John Gamble : Toni, to your comment, we weren't trying to indicate that it was specific to mortgage and not as much to deferrals, right? Both of those are significant impacts, resulting in the decline in USIS in the fourth quarter. So we're seeing a continuation of what we saw in the third quarter continuing into the fourth quarter in terms of customer deferrals. And then also, obviously, the double-digit decline in mortgage are the 2 largest factors resulting in the decline in USIS. Toni Kaplan : Okay. And any sense on if there have been customers that you've been able to sort of prove so far that you can satisfy their data requirements? Paulino Barros : Indeed. We have had renewals. We have new customers, in both EWS and USIS, in that \u2013 but this is a process. This is \u2013 we'll have to regain our credibility and make sure that we will deliver on the execution plans that we have in place. John Gamble : We indicated that we're seeing deferrals into 2018, because we certainly understand that this process takes time, right, and that \u2013 and we need to work through all of the questions our customers would have and be extremely transparent with them so that they can complete their reviews and move forward. So that's why we indicated you're looking at deferrals into 2018. Paulino Barros : Correct. Toni Kaplan : Okay, I understood. And just last for me on the consumer business. Can you give us a number of how many have signed up for the free product and what your expectation would be that, that number reaches? And could you just tell us what the difference is between your paid product and the free product, so basically the ongoing business that you're generating in USIS on the B2C side? John Gamble : Yes. I think in the 10-Q, we provided information in terms of the range of expenses we expected to incur. And we provided detail around the \u2013 how the estimate was generated. So that's probably the best source for that information. And on the second question, I'm not sure I understood it completely. But if you'd like to understand the differences between the paid product which exists and the free product, that information is also available on the website. To be clear, we're not currently selling the paid product on the website, right? So if we have existing customers that we're continuing to service as best we can and doing our best service for them, but we're currently not advertising, not cross-selling, and you can't purchase that product on the website. Toni Kaplan : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI. David Togut : Thank you, good morning. Could you provide a little more clarity on why you think the customer deferrals will actually be closed at some point in '18 and you don't think that there are market share losses? Paulino Barros : Well, I think that the network today is better than was in the beginning of this process, and it'll be better tomorrow as we continue to make improvements and invest, as John suggested, the amount of money, the resources that we're investing in to get it done. We believe that we're starting now. And actually, we start next week, in 10 days, sharing the issues that we have related to this process with the key customers that we have and that they will understand what happened and share the road map that we have to fix this in the short term and the long term. A significant amount of this in the short term has been addressed. And so as long as they understand \u2013 this is a technical conversation. As long as they understand the rationale we have in place, then they have no reasons why not to do so. We understand there's a reputational part of the process as well. We \u2013 this is our job to make sure that they're totally informed about our capabilities and be confident to do business again with us. Of course, it's not going to be done in few quarters, but we are confident that we have the resources in place to make sure that we will inform our customers to be \u2013 it's easy of doing business with us again in the near future. John Gamble : Also, we characterized these as deferrals, because in some cases, these are solutions which we're uniquely positioned to be able to deliver. In other cases, because the conversations are ongoing and are actually \u2013 it's clear that they are being deferred, decision is being deferred based on the outcome of continuing discussions around security. But certainly, to your point, to the extent something becomes deferred over an extended period of time, it's certainly lost. It's only been 2 months since the cyber event. So the discussions are ongoing. So we were characterizing them as deferred. Obviously, if those deferrals continue, those become cancellations. Or these actions that won't occur, not cancellations. They haven't been signed, sorry. David Togut : Got it. A quick question on insurance coverage. You indicated your insurance coverage is beyond the amount of cyber spending you've had so far. Can you dimension for us what your insurance coverage might be? And what's your overall level of comfort that the majority of the cyber costs would be covered by insurance as opposed to being more Equifax ultimately? John Gamble : Yes. So we're not going to specifically disclose the specific amount of the coverage. And in general, we believe that the type of cost that we've incurred related to the cyber event are indeed under the general structure of the policy, and we're currently in discussions with the insurers around completing \u2013 around moving forward with insurance claims. And we would expect to make very good progress in this quarter on that process. David Togut : Understood. A quick final question from me. You mentioned that your current leverage is only 2.32x, and yet you've halted the share repurchase. So could you flesh out why you've halted the share repurchase? Obviously, the stock is down significantly. Is it more a reflection of uncertain earnings power going forward or you just want to keep headroom for potential legal claims against Equifax? John Gamble : It's more specifically around the fact that given the cybersecurity event that's ongoing, there's ongoing investigations with the company, as Paulino mentioned in his script, that we just don't think it's appropriate for us to be purchasing shares at this time. David Togut : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : And your next question comes from Brett Huff with Stephens, Inc. Brett Huff : Good morning and thanks for all the details. My question is a little bit of a follow-up on the security spend. And John, I think you were helpful in saying \u2013 you gave us sort of a range of $60 million to $75 million. And I think you said 1/3 of that in the 4Q was going to be for security and IT. I believe when Rick testified in front of Congress, he mentioned that over the last 3 years, you all spent maybe $250 million or so on cybersecurity and network. Is that $85 million a year the right base to think about? And then can you \u2013 if that's true, can you tell us how much more you might be spending going forward? We just get a lot of question on what's the ongoing kind of dimension of additional ongoing expense for this, if you could. John Gamble : Understand it, and I think we'll be able to give you a much better view as to what the ongoing increase in spend will be when we hit our discussion at the end of the fourth quarter. My statements earlier were about 1/3 of the $60 million to $75 million on security in the fourth quarter. That is specifically incremental spend in the quarter, right? It in no way reflects the normal ongoing spend. So obviously, our spend this year is up dramatically from what it has been in the past. To turn to the dimension side of our spend, I think probably the best thing I can reference is we spend in 2017, prior to the breach occurring, so if you took a look at what our forecast was, what we were budgeting, we would have spent about 12% of IT and security combined on our security specifically. So that's probably the best metric to use. Brett Huff : Okay. And then you also mentioned that there may be some free monitoring or similar services for folks in the U.K. and Canada. I'm not sure if that's included in the $56 million to $110 million dimensionalized number you gave us from the \u2013 kind of taking them on the balance sheet or running that through the P&L. Is that included or is there more to come from that? John Gamble : It is included in \u2013 but the U.S. is by far the substantial portion of the cost. Brett Huff : Great. That\u2019s all I needed, appreciated. Operator : And your next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Andrew Steinerman : Hi, it's Andrew. I also remember that 12% comment in the hearing, the 12% of your budgeted spend of the IT budget spent on security. Paulino mentioned in the hearing this week that four times more has been spent post-breach. Just help us understand what the four times means? John Gamble : Yes. so if you think about the total spend, the total amount of spent not only on security, I don't think he said immediately post-breach. But total on security as well as the other costs, for example, that I referenced we would be incurring in the fourth quarters, that's the type of substantial increase we're talking about that's ongoing in terms of investigation into the cybersecurity event as well as remediation, which is all around IT security and IT investigation in general, right? So those total expenses are the expense levels, I believe, were being referenced there. Andrew Steinerman : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Deutsche Bank. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Thank you. I just wanted to clarify one comment. Have you been able to identify in terms of contain the fraud aspect of the event at that point, or is that still in the process of being identified? I guess, the impact of the breach in terms of specific dollar amount from people's credit being impacted and things like that, or was that still ongoing? John Gamble : Yes. I think all we said in the script was that in terms of identifying specific instances specifically related to the Equifax data that we haven't identified. We can't say that nothing has occurred, right? That was, I think, all we were attempting to say with that statement. Kevin McVeigh : Got it. So just at this point, obviously, you haven't seen any direct impact, but that's still ongoing. Is that a fair way to think about it? John Gamble : All we're indicating is we don't have any direct evidence. But obviously, we can't speak to others may have other evidence that they would consider. We were just indicating based on our checks, what we have seen. Kevin McVeigh : Understood. That's helpful. And just can you quantify the amount you're insured up until, like is there a certain dollar amount that you're insured up to? John Gamble : Yes. Again, we're not going to disclose the cap on our insurance. Kevin McVeigh : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : And your next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Andrew Jeffrey : Hi guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Hey, John, you mentioned in USIS outside of the breach that you thought \u2013 and I think outside of mortgage, too, that you saw a little bit of weakness. Your competitors perhaps haven't been seeing that. Can you just elaborate on trends and whether some of that is vertical market-specific or perhaps clarify what you're seeing outside, to the extent that's possible, outside of any cybersecurity related deferrals? John Gamble : And again, to your point, right, I have to admit, given the impact of cyber, it is a little more difficult right now to give specific industry data. But I think in the script, we referenced commercial and auto. Auto, we did see some weakness in the third quarter. If you think about where Equifax is strong, we're particularly strong in the Southeast. And some of the weather-related events, we think, impacted us in the quarter, perhaps more than others, but certainly impacted us in the quarter. Some of that will come back in the fourth quarter, but we did see some weakness in auto. Commercial, as you know, we've been transitioning and building our own commercial financial network here over the past year. And versus last year, we have seen some weaker revenue as we transition off of the prior exchange moving to our own exchange. And we've seen some weakness in revenue related to that transition. And I'd say those are 2 areas that are probably specific to Equifax. Andrew Jeffrey : And then to the extent there's been any sort of authentication friction, I'm thinking about the issuer customers as they work to improve authentication and to ensure authentication, are there any sort of repercussions for Equifax? Are you working with customers to deal with that? How do you think about the consumer credit ecosystem broadly and any implications for Equifax around challenges issuers may face authenticating? I'm thinking about online credit card apps, in particular, for example. John Gamble : Could you ask your question one more time. I want to make sure we understood it. I'm not completely clear. Andrew Jeffrey : I'm just wondering to the extent an issuer is losing business \u2013 and again, I'm thinking about credit cards, because there are roadblocks or friction that's being introduced into the process of authenticating an applicant or an application. When you talk to your issuers about that, can you help them remediate? Is that one of the things you think that causes them to defer spending? In other words, any blowback on their consumer credit business, does that affect Equifax one way or another? Is it something that you can proactively address with your customers? John Gamble : Well, I \u2013 we are certainly discussed with our customers probably around this event. In general, right, around authentication, that is an area we have attempted to be of service to our customers in the past. So we'll continue to have those conversations. But anything specific to this event related to that, I don't really think so. But Paulino may want to address that. Paulino Barros : Yes, I think that in general terms, the industry is much more sophisticated to use different and diverse data assets to go through the authentication process. So the kind of information that was taken from us and the PII information has had \u2013 is not part of their multifactor authentication process that used to normally bring a customer in. So I think that the industry is way ahead on this process. John Gamble : So again \u2013 yes. And if your question is, to that effect, the way a customer wants to deal with us can hard press to speak with that. But again, we're focused very much on making sure they understand everything that occurred and what we're doing to try to improve it. Andrew Jeffrey : Okay. I appreciate that. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Jeffrey Meuler with Baird. Jeffrey Meuler : Yes, thanks. I think you said that you're not seeing any meaningful B2B share shift or elevated contract cancellation rights. Can you just, first, I guess, confirm that, that's true for your most recent data into early November? And then the related question would be, I guess, just sizing up the magnitude of the lost USIS revenue : one, you didn't disclose this until September 7 and there was less than 1-month impact in the quarter. Just trying to understand, in a typical business environment, roughly how much of your revenue is what you would call discrete revenue from projects or implementation or other forms of discrete revenue? John Gamble : Yes. So we disclosed Marketing Services, and as we indicated, that's where most of the discrete revenue would come from. Oftentimes, the discrete revenue can be more back-end-loaded in a quarter than the other revenue \u2013 online revenue than you would see. So that is why you may have seen a bigger impact in USIS, even though the announcement was made in September. And I'm sorry, what was the first part of your question? Jeffrey Meuler : Just confirming that you've not seen any meaningful B2B share shift or an elevated contract cancellation rate through the most recent data, I guess, into late October, early November? John Gamble : Yes. So again, we made some \u2013 we made comments in the script around what we saw in the third quarter, and we haven't extended really beyond that. But as Paulino said, we're continuing to work very closely with customers to try to make sure that they get through their process of understanding what occurred and being able to move forward with us in the way they have in the past. So that \u2013 those processes continue, and we'll update you on how they proceed when we get out in the fourth quarter. We also did give you some view as to what we thought the impact of the event would be in the fourth quarter in terms of our revenue. So that would suggest you look there in terms of what we think the impact may be in the fourth quarter. Jeffrey Meuler : Okay. And then finally, on The Work Number, any meaningful loss of access to records, or do you expect a record growth to slow meaningfully? John Gamble : So again, I think we made a comment in the script around working very closely with data contributors. USIS \u2013 sorry, EWS continues to work very closely with data contributors. And as we indicated, it's important to recognize that EWS systems were not impacted by this event. Jeffrey Meuler : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Gary Bisbee with RBC. Gary Bisbee : Hi guys, good morning. The first question, I just wanted to understand how you're thinking about what gets put in and not put in this breach a total expense line that you included. And I guess what I'm really getting at, clearly, some of the IT spend is going to be more ongoing in nature at a higher level. I also think one might argue, any spend on developing the new lifetime free lock and unlock capabilities that you're going to be introducing next year, those aren't \u2013 hard to argue those are onetime in nature. And so then I think many investors would argue those should not be added back to adjusted earnings. I appreciate trying to help us understand the magnitude of spend, but how are you going to think about that and handle that disclosure as we move forward throughout this process? John Gamble : Yes. So we broke it out specifically here, because in the fourth quarter, the vast majority of that $60 million to $75 million is really with third parties and consultants as the investigative and planning process is ramped and accelerated in this process. But going forward, as has been our practice, our ongoing spend in IT and security will absolutely be included in our non-GAAP results as well the cost of delivering any free product or any future developments of that free product, right? So we will actively have in the past, which is to make sure that all of those costs are included in our non-GAAP results. So you may see a little bit of lead into the first quarter of some of the extremely elevated spending that you're seeing in the fourth quarter. But on an ongoing basis, we'll act as we have always, which is to include anything which is part of our ongoing business in our non-GAAP results. Does that help? Gary Bisbee : Yes, definitely. I appreciate that. And then the follow-up, just in any given year, how much of revenue growth or how much contribution to revenue does new business, bookings, how much has that been? And I guess, what I'm wondering is the 3% to 4% revenue hit that you're guiding to for talking about for Q4, I mean, is that a run rate number if we were to make the dramatic assumption that you have no ability to win new business for several more quarters? Or is 3% to 4% \u2013 could that ramp to a larger revenue hit if the deferrals extend more deeply into 2018? John Gamble : I think the only thing we've historically disclosed around drivers of revenue growth specifically, I think that are consistent with your question, is around NPI. And we've indicated that our new product innovation process delivers on the order of 300 basis points of growth a year, plus or minus a little bit depending on the year. And so that's probably the only number we've disclosed historically. We've never disclosed percentage of contracts renewed or new in a year. That's not something we've ever disclosed, but we have talked about NPI. Gary Bisbee : Okay. And then just one last quick one. Can you give a sense of how much distraction within the organization, outside of the senior executive leadership where we know it's been extraordinary, has \u2013 do you think this is have a meaningful impact several layers down, or have you been able to work hard to keep people generally pushing in the right direction despite all of the headlines? Paulino Barros : Thank you for the question. This was exactly why we created the Chief Transformation Officer, to make sure that we focus our business people into the business side. And we have someone responsible for the short-term and the long-term initiatives that will be generated by this transformation that we have. And also, given our execution and process streamlining capabilities, we're focusing all this \u2013 most of it \u2013 most of these resources within the transformation area, so the business can continue to run and be aggressive and what they have to do, why we do a transformation and execution plans under a separate organization. Of course, in general, everybody got impacted, because this is very disappointing to us as well. So the \u2013 but the commitment and resilience of our employees has been outstanding in how we want to focus on getting back on the boat and row \u2013 continue to rowing again. John Gamble : And the focus on security is ongoing, right? We should all understand that, that focus on security is through the entire company. Every person, I speak about my organization as well, right, is ongoing and continuous. So I wouldn't call that distraction. I would call that focus. Paulino Barros : We'll be part of that going forward. Gary Bisbee : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I just want to focus a little bit on the direct-to-consumer business. And Paulino made a comment about ensuring that consumers have access to their credit for life. And I want to understand, is that going to be lock, unlock product? Are you envisioning something more than that in terms of what the others \u2013 the credit monitoring that you're providing that there's going to be some kind of version of that, that would just be out there for consumers in the marketplace? I just want to understand what you're thinking about there. Paulino Barros : This is exactly what you've understood. The focus is on lock, unlock capability that consumers will have when we launch this service in the end of January. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. And then when you don't market in this business, what is the typical attrition that we should think about? Because you're not going to have marketed for at least probably 6 months. And I'm not sure if you're planning to see if you're going to start up marketing right away. But as we try to gauge what the impact is to the rest of the business, can you give us just an idea of what attrition is? And frankly also, what does that mean in terms of not putting the expenses into that part of that business? John Gamble : Yes. So Shlomo, I think all I can point you to is we did give some specific view on where we think GCS revenue will look like in the fourth quarter. And then we will certainly give you more color as we get into next year. It's still a bit early to know, right? it's only been a couple of months. But when we gave you our GCS revenue for the fourth quarter, that decline really is heavily related to the question that you asked, and we gave you our best view as to what we think that impact would probably be. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. And then if you don't mind, as I shift over just to the cost component, it seems to me like there's product delivery cost and then there's kind of an ongoing IT cost. When you talk about the $56 million to $110 million, is that product cost in terms of requirement to buy information from other bureaus and the like, but there are other IT costs on top of that? Or is this a totally inclusive cost? Or how should I be thinking of that? John Gamble : Yes. The $56 million to $110 million is almost exclusively external cost. It's really the cost of purchasing services from others that we have to deliver. The \u2013 yes \u2013 and also call center. I'm sorry, so the call center cost is in there, which is internal as well as we use some third parties for call center and then the third-party costs associated with the product that we're delivering to people for free. The internal cost is reflected in our ongoing results. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : And your next question comes from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Bill Warmington : Good morning, everyone. The \u2013 so on the cybersecurity side, it seems like there are really 2 processes involved. On the \u2013 there are the internal changes that you're making to your own cybersecurity. And then externally, there's an evaluation by your clients on your cybersecurity. And so I wanted to ask, when is your cybersecurity going to be up to code or up to standard, however, you want to define that? And it sounds like based on your comment about going out within the next couple of weeks, you could be there or close or whether that's a fourth quarter phenomenon where you feel like, okay, we're up to standard. Paulino Barros : No, I think that we have a \u2013 this is a journey here. Given the magnitude of the impact that we have, we're going to have 2 stage, of course. One is to make sure the current systems and capabilities of our security organization and systems will be in place to make sure that we're going to the next stage and then design the future stage that we want to have for the business. This is going to be an ongoing effort. There's opportunity for us to modernize and bring that new technology into place. And this is a phenomenon that the entire industry is going to have, okay? The hacking industry continues to evolve, and we need to be ahead of them, and we'll do so. This is the core of our business. We need to be ahead of that industry. John Gamble : And we're investing heavily to make sure we \u2013 that our security substantially improves continuously, right? And that's really what we're talking about here. I can't make any comment about your \u2013 the specifics of your first question. But we're investing very heavily to make sure that we're seeing substantial continuous improvement not only today, not only tomorrow, but going forward into the future. So that's progressing and progressing very rapidly and as Paulino has talked about, so our conversations with customers, ensuring they understand where we stand and then what we're doing going forward. Bill Warmington : Has there been any further progress in identifying whether the hack was done by a foreign state actor? Now Bloomberg had run a story saying that there was evidence of that, but it didn't sound like anything definitive has come out. When is there a pronouncement about that? Paulino Barros : Yes. What we have \u2013 as I have my testimony declared, there's no \u2013 we have no evidence of any third-party, any nation involved in the process. Bill Warmington : Got it. And then a couple of housekeeping items. What was mortgage-related revenue and the percentage of third quarter revenue? John Gamble : I don't have that number at my fingertips, but we'll look it up and we'll give it when the next person asks the question. Bill Warmington : Okay. John Gamble : Thanks. Bill Warmington : Thank you very much. Operator : And your next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. George Tong : Hi, thanks, good morning. You're guiding to $60 million to $75 million of breach-related onetime costs in 4Q. Can you help frame how you're thinking about total costs of the breach and how much you're accruing for breach costs beyond the $56 million to $110 million that you outlined that's related to free monitoring costs? John Gamble : So the accrual, this \u2013 the range of the accrual reflects our current estimate of what we think the total costs will be based on differing assumptions related to the breach. And then for the full year, if you include the $60 million to $75 million, that would give you the total amount of costs that we expect to incur in 2017. George Tong : Got it. Going back to market share shifts, can you elaborate on how much of the USIS decline was due to the data breach compared to mortgage market decline and if you anticipate customer deferral activity to worsen in 4Q compared to 3Q based on customer conversations since the third quarter? John Gamble : And so in terms of this split of those 2, pardon me \u2013 so in terms of the split of those 2, we didn't indicate specifically how much was related to the cybersecurity incident and how much related to the mortgage market decline. So we didn't give those specific numbers. And then also if you could ask your question again, just to make sure I understood it. George Tong : Yes. Whether you expect deferral activity to worsen in 4Q compared to 3Q just based on the customer conversations you've had since the third quarter? John Gamble : Yes, so going back to a previous question, so the mortgage market revenue \u2013 mortgage revenue was about 19% of the total revenue for the quarter. So sorry for the deferral on that. And in terms of what we're expecting for the cyber incident impact, we indicated that \u2013 what \u2013 we indicated in our script what we expected it to be in the fourth quarter. It's certainly greater than the third quarter, but I think a lot of that's simply because of the increased amount of time that will incur that impact. And so it was only announced in September in the third quarter and therefore saw a more limited impact. So I think we indicated 3% or 4%, and that's consistent with what we expect. George Tong : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Tim McHugh with William Blair. Stephen Sheldon : Good morning. It's Stephen Sheldon on for Tim. Just wanted to ask about the higher non-controlling interest this quarter, I guess. What drove that? And does it imply that you're seeing stronger trends from the U.K. TDK contract? John Gamble : Some of our non-U. S. businesses have partners. In some cases, in some of our businesses, we have partnerships with financial institutions in the countries in which we operate. And therefore when those businesses do better, the non-controlling interest was out. So that's basically it. So it isn't necessarily specific to the U.K. It's a general statement. Operator : And I would now like in the call back over to Jeff Dodge for any additional or closing remarks. Jeff Dodge : Okay. I'd like to thank everybody for their time and interest. And with that, operator, we'll conclude the call. Thanks, everybody. Operator : And once again, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Today's conference is being recorded. And at this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Jeff Dodge. Please go ahead. Jeff Dodge : Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Jeff Dodge with Investor Relations. And with me today are Paulino Barros, Chief Executive Officer; John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer; and Trevor Burns, Investor Relations. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com. During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2017 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. Also, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance. For the fourth quarter of 2017, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes, among other things, acquisition-related amortization expense; certain costs related to the cybersecurity incident, including costs to investigate and remediate the cybersecurity incident; legal and professional services; a contingent liability for cost associated with providing free credit file monitoring and identity theft protection services to consumers; and the income tax effects of stock awards recognized upon vesting or settlement and in the recently enacted U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to Equifax adding back interest expense, net of interest income; depreciation and amortization; income tax expense and also excluding certain onetime items, including the cost related to the cybersecurity incident. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our website. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Paulino. Paulino Barros : Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we provided an update on the cybersecurity incident that occurred last year. Let me provide now some perspective. In conjunction with the forensic investigation completed last fall by Mandiant, we concluded that the attack that was predominantly focused on selling Social Security numbers. So, we worked with Mandiant and defined a reasonable and sound methodology that use names and Social Security numbers as the key data elements to identify persons impacted. As we continued to analyze the data, we were able to identify approximately 2.4 million consumers, whose names and partial driver's license information were stolen, but who were not in the previously identified population. The information was partial because in the vast majority of cases, it did not include home addresses, state of issuance, date of issuance and/or expiration dates. They were not identified using the original methodology as their Social Security number was not stolen. We use proprietary company records that the attacker did not steal and engaged the resources of external data provider in order to identify these consumers. Additional details on this can be found in yesterday's press release and in our 10-K. Ever since September 7, we have taken and will continue to take steps to reach out and assist consumers and our customers. Transparency and open communication has been the cornerstone of our efforts following the disclosure. It is with this commitment in mind that we are actively reaching out and we will be offering those additional consumers identity theft protection and file monitoring services at no cost today. In the 4 months since our third quarter earnings release, we have made substantial progress in the four critical areas of focus I highlighted. I would like to thank our 10,000-plus employees around the world for their tremendous execution and dedication over this period. I would like also to thank our customers and partners for their support as we remediate the cybersecurity incident and restore our reputation. There will still be a lot of heavy lifting in 2018 and 2019 as we execute our information technology and data security plans, work to regain the confidence of our customers and consumers, work with regulators and state and federal governments and develop new solutions to protect sensitive consumer information in today's rapidly advancing technology ecosystem. The Equifax teams understands the need for consistent strong execution against our plans over the next 18 to 24-month period with a focus on making Equifax a global leader in information technology and data security and to reestablish Equifax as the innovator in delivering data and analytics-based solutions and insights our customers use to make better decisions. Fourth quarter financial results from ongoing operations came in better than unexpected both from revenue and cash EPS. Growth cost related to the cybersecurity incident came in about as expected, and we were partially offset by insurance and recoveries in the quarter. John Gamble will walk you through the details of the results, including the net costs related to the cybersecurity incident and the impact of the U.S. tax reform, as well as provide our current view of full year 2018. We continue to make great progress on the four critical areas of focus we highlighted in our third quarter 2017 earnings call in November. These critical efforts are being closely managed by our transformation office with the support of outside advisors. First, improving consumer support and consumer's ability to understand and control access to credit information. We believe that the data and analytical service that Equifax provides substantially increases transparency in credit decisions, allowing financial institutions and other businesses to make more informed and timely consumer credit decisions. Equifax believes, in general, this increases access to and reduces the cost of credit to consumers worldwide. We are committed to work with others in our industry in providing education to help consumers better understand the role we play in the financial ecosystem and provide the technology to help consumer control access to credit information about them. We substantially improved both online and consumer support related to the TrustedID Premier service. We offer it free to all U.S. consumers, including the free for life Lock & Alert service launched on January 31. We believe both the online and call center support experience will continue to substantially improve throughout the quarter. Through February 23, 97% of the calls were answered in less than 30 seconds and the abandon rate was less than 1%. We will continue to make improvements in the service throughout 2018. The period in which we offer free credit freezes has been extended through June 2018. Currently, the number of credit freezes are less than 2% of the total U.S. credit file. This level of credit freezes have been relatively stable since mid-November. Lock & Alert was successfully launched on January 31, as we committed last fall. The service we offer is simple and easy-to-use. A consumer can be seen in front of a lending officer, unlock their Equifax credit report, complete the loan approval process and then lock their report again. The ultimate control for the consumer is facilitating a decision for our product or service the consumer wants when they want it, and without exposing the information to fraudsters or criminals. We have developed educational material to help consumers understand personal credit information and how they can best protect that information from fraudulent use. The material includes new video content to aid interest and educating, using everyday terms and language the consumer can easily understand. It can be found in our equifax.com website. We have also integrated social media, including YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter, to facilitate a new, more consumer-friendly conversation. I encourage each of you to try the service.  Second, ensuring we take significant action to protect the consumer and commercial data that has been entrusted to us around the world. We are committed to becoming an industry leader in information technology and information security management, and the plans we have established reflect this goal. Substantial progress has been made since November, working closely with our partners in four critical areas. A, strengthening IT and data security at the infrastructure network and application layers. Cyber operation has been enhanced to provide broad and redundant network visibility, intrusion protection detection and access monitoring and controls. At present, we have three redundant teams, two external, executing cyber operations and system monitoring. We are and will continue implementing what we believe are industry best practice in systems. We announced the permanent CISO last week, Jamil Farshchi. He comes to Equifax with great experience from Home Depot, Time Warner, Visa and NASA. Russ Ayres, our Interim CISO will work with Jamil during a leadership transition period to ensure we maintain consistent in our interactions with customers and regulators. Russ will continue with Equifax in a senior leadership position. I want to personally thank Russ Ayres for his incredible work over the past 6 months. Work to streamline and simplifying our networks and application infrastructure has extended and accelerated. This initiative will not only enhance our security posture by reducing what is known as the attack surface, but it will also support the rest of product execution. And lower complexity should also enhance our network resiliency and ultimately, lower costs. Modern processes and structures for the management of the information technology and data security have been and will continue to be refined and is present. We are adopting our robust enterprise risk management framework based on the three lines of defense used by leading financial institutions and in line with the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council's, FFIEC, framework. Let me explain this model. The first line of defense is the operational line. The organizational leader, who directly own and manage the risk, in this case, IT and security. The second line of defense provides risk oversight. We are substantially building out a risk office, which will have a direct reporting line to the technology and other committees of the board. The risk office will be responsible for establishing risk frameworks, policy and standards, performing independent risk-based monitoring and testing and independently identifying and assessing material, IT and security risks. The third line of defense is, as would be expected, our internal audit group, which we will supplement with third-party support. Internal audit working with third-party auditors will audit the effectiveness of second line oversight, as well as doing direct, extended audits of the first line. The technology commission of the board has been tasked with the oversight of IT security and data governance. The risk office being formed will have independent reporting to the technology committee. Internal audit and certified audit plans and results will be revealed by the technology committee. An outside adviser, currently PwC, will report quarterly to the technology committee on the progress of our enhanced technology and information security governance against plans and will annually provide an overall risk assessment. Risk escalation process have been revised to support rapid escalation of potential information and data security events, as well as other areas that would possibly require public disclosure and/or the suspension of trading in Equifax securities by executives or personnel. The annual incentive plans for all employees have been revised to include achievement of information technology and data security priorities. Also, the senior leadership team will have additional measurable MBOs tied to information technology and data security. Enhanced data governance and protection practice are moving forward as well. We have added a Chief Private and Data Government Officer to lead this area and drive consistent practice globally. Our 2018 and 2019 IT and security plans are substantially in place and execution is underway. Third, working with customers and partners to gain their insights reviewed for us and most importantly, solidify our historic relationships. Transparency into the cybersecurity incident, our response and our overall plans is a continued area of focus. Over the past 4 months, we have significantly extended the path and frequency of detailed customer and partner meetings, both domestic and international. We believe these briefings have provided much greater clarity for both our customers and partners. In addition to specific customer reviews, multiple whole day group briefings have been held for groups of customers and partner executives and security teams. The meetings have focused on detailed discussions of the incident, where immediate response and most importantly, our mid and long-term information technology and data security plans. These briefings were led by our business unit presidents, our CISO, our CIO, our Chief Transformation Officer and PwC. And we believe we're very successful as they allowed customers and partners to interact. And we serve not only to improve understanding of our effort, but also to provide our customers and partners with insights that can assist their own IT and data security efforts. We believe we are making good progress with customers and partners in terms of regaining their trust and their willingness to utilize our new and unique product offerings. As expected, we did see an impact related to these factors on our USIS and Workforce Solutions revenue in fourth quarter 2017. However, we saw this impact lessen as we moved through the quarter and more customers began purchasing new products as discreet services. GCS revenue was impacted in fourth quarter 2017 to a greater extent than third quarter 2017, and the subscriber base was impacted by churn and the substantial reduction in customer additions. This was expected. And as we stop all direct-to-consumer advertising and gross selling activities in September, customers and partners continue to offer assistance and are collaborating to help us accelerate our IT data security implementations, and we greatly appreciate this partnership. Fourth, responding to and working with government and other regulatory bodies as they investigate the incident. We are incorporating and working closely with U.S. state and federal regulatory agencies and legislators and several regulatory agencies outside the United States as they continue their investigation of the cybersecurity incident. We continue to be fully committed to re-earning the trust of consumers and the governmental bodies chartered with protecting those consumers. The 2017 10-K filed last night provides details regarding the legal and regulatory claims against Equifax, generated related to the cybersecurity incident. Due to the very early stage in the process of these claims, we are unable to provide any view of potential outcomes. As we look to 2018, in addition to their commitment to the four critical focus areas we just discussed, the business units are executing on their critical growth initiatives. Across USIS, Workforce Solutions and International, there are 3 common themes. First, explaining the impact of analytics, including machine learning through Cambrian Ignite. Two, increasing penetration in the identity and fraud markets. And three, continue to grow solutions that integrate Equifax customers and third-party data sources, utilizing our global interconnect decisioning and IP gateway platforms. USIS will drive New Product Innovation, NPI, and penetration of existing products through : one, driving Cambrian, Ignite and marketplace solutions across more customers and verticals, including trended data solutions and machine learning-based solutions; two, expanding real estate beyond mortgage to include rental markets and data; third, extending InstaTouch, an InterConnect-based product, across more verticals and customer interaction use case; fourth, driving market adoption of identity verification products, only ID, and other platforms-based products new to the market, late in 2017; and five, increasing market friction of our data-driven marketing solutions. International had an outstanding year in 2017, particularly with delivering strong NPI-based growth. In 2018, they will drive growth through, one, increasing Cambrian, Ignite based solutions in Canada and Australia, including trended data and machine learning-based solutions, deploying Cambrian throughout Latin America and the U.K. to accelerate their delivery of advanced analytics; two, expanding market penetration in fraud prevention in Australia and Latin America using our global fraud exchange platform; three, building on their success in growing debt management globally, leveraging recent wins in Latin America and Canada; and fourth, building on recent wins in Europe, Canada and Latin America in decisioning solutions based on analytics through Cambrian and our InterConnect platform.  Workforce Solutions delivered yet another strong year in 2017, driving by growth in the verification business. In 2018, they'll continue to drive growth through : one, continued expansion of channel partners and growth of records in verification database, leveraging significant operational improvements in the process of loading records into the database and accessing the database for verifications; two, international expansion of the verification business into Canada and Australia; and third, in Employer Services, expansion of our services in hiring and on-boarding solutions. The Global Consumer Solution business unit is the most directly tasked with our critical focus on improving consumer support. And the U.S. consumer direct revenue was most significantly impacted by the cybersecurity incident. In the first quarter 2018, as we launch the new free walk and alert service, we will continue to refrain from direct-to-consumer advertising for U.S. consumer direct-based products. We continue to evaluate the U.S. consumer direct business and will provide an update to you as decisions are made. As they enter 2018, the GCS team will be focused on : First, continue the launch of Lock & Alert following the launch on January 31 and ensuring the delivery of outstanding service to the users of our TrustedID Premier service; second, improving the overall service levels throughout our worldwide consumer direct business; and third, beating and expanding our successful direct-to-consumer reseller business and our recent ID Watchdog acquisition in the U.S. In NPI, our New Product Innovation, continue to make strong contribution to our revenue growth. We ended 2017 with 55 new product launches, a 10% vitality index, and the 107 active new product initiatives in the pipeline for 2018. Our current outlook for 2018 is to further build on the success we realized in 2017 and the three drivers with NPI revenue for 2018 included. InstaTouch, digital ID, IBM fraud, Ignite and Cambrian compliance and connect and a variety of new solutions in the housing and the auto verticals. In 2018, the economic background for the major markets we service each generated favorable. Our expectation in U.S. GDP will be up between 2.5% and 3%. We expect modest growth in consumer credit, excluding mortgage. Mortgage market inquiries volume is expected to be down double digits for the full year of 2018 as we expect refinancing to be down consistent with 2017, with purchase inquiry volume up strongly. Consumer credit activity is expected to be broadly up across autos, bankcard, retail card, nonrevolving credit and home equity. Internationally, we are expecting the U.K. and Canada to show slow growth with GDP growth slightly under 2%. Australia is expected to show good growth at around 2.5% with growth in Spain slowing to just under 3%. The strongest growth is expected in Latin America, where our largest countries of Argentina and Chile are expected to see increased GDP growth. As we have said before, I and the entire Equifax organization apologize to the individuals whose personal information was stolen in the cyberattack, and we apologize as well as to our customers, partners, investors, communities and our seedlings [ph], who were disrupted by the cybersecurity incident at Equifax.  And as I have met with our employees throughout the world, there's a consistent and great commitment to continue to execute on the critical objectives discussed today and last quarter, and to continue to deliver with differentiated products and solutions to our customers based on the industry-leading analytics and unique data assets that allow us to deliver consistent growth and performance over the past decade. They are also committed to regaining the consumer's trust and confidence in how we manage, secure and use information about them. With that, let me hand it over to John. John Gamble : Thank you, Paulino, and good morning, everyone. As before, I will generally be referring to the financial results else from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis. For 2017, additional items excluded from our non-GAAP results are the onetime cost related to the cybersecurity incident and the onetime benefit related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. We'll provide details on these two items so you can consider them in your analysis. In total, in 2017, we incurred nonrecurring costs related to the cybersecurity incident of $164 million. These have been partially offset by insurance recoveries of $50 million resulting in a net nonrecurring charge of $114 million. The $113 million of gross costs were generally for legal, cyber forensic investigations and other professional services related to the investigation of the incident or nonrecurring actions to improve security. $51 million in accrued and incurred gross expenses related to the TrustedID Premier service we offered free to all U.S. citizens. This represents our estimate of costs to service individuals using the service today. The above costs are offset by $50 million of insurance recoveries for costs incurred to date and for which we have received the cash. We have $125 million of cybersecurity insurance under our E&L policy. We continue to expect to make claims to fully utilize the policy. In 4Q 2017, the net nonrecurring costs related to the cybersecurity incident were $27 million. This reflected $77 million in gross cost, principally legal and other professional services related to the investigation of the incident or actions to improve security, offset by the $50 million of insurance recoveries, $15 million of which was received in 2017. The $77 million in gross cost were consistent with the guidance we provided in November. In 4Q 2017, we had $48 million nonrecurring after-tax benefit from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. This benefit was principally from the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities at the lower U.S. tax rate, which was partially offset by lower benefit of various foreign tax items. We expect our effective tax rate in 2018 to be approximately 27%. There are still some aspects of the law that needs further clarification and as these become more clear, our expected tax rate could change. Now let's look at our operating results for the quarter. Total revenue for the quarter was $839 million, up 5% on a reported basis and up 4% on a local currency basis from Q4 2016. For the quarter, FX was an $8 million benefit. Adjusted EPS was $1.39, down 2%. In the quarter, we estimate that the cybersecurity incident negatively impacted total company revenue by just over 3%. This was consistent with the guidance we provided in November. USIS revenue in 4Q 2017 was $313 million, down 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. We estimate that the impact from the cybersecurity incident for USIS negatively impacted revenue by about 3.5% in the quarter. Online Information Solutions revenue was $211 million flat, when compared to the year-ago period. The decline in mortgage market activity, along with a negative impact of the cybersecurity incident, was partially offset by growth in other online activity, including banking in addition to growth in our ID and fraud solutions. Total mortgage-related revenue for USIS was down 5% and total mortgage-related revenue for Equifax, including Workforce Solutions, was down less than 1%. This quarter was the first where we did not have the year-over-year benefit from trended data. As before, our performance continues to outpace the overall mortgage market or increase were down approximately 7%. For the year, U.S. total mortgage related revenue was up 7%. Overall mortgage market increase were down for the year approximately 6%. Financial Marketing Services revenue was $69 million in 4Q 2017, up 1%. Revenue in this segment tends to be project oriented and as such, was more impacted by the cybersecurity incident. As we move through the quarter, performance in the segment improved. Normalizing USIS revenue for the estimated negative impact of the cybersecurity incident and to a flat mortgage market, USIS revenue growth would have been between 4% and 5%. The adjusted EBITDA margin for USIS was 48.5%, down from 51% in 4Q 2016. The lower margins reflect the revenue decline in 2017. International revenue was $245 million in 4Q 2017, up 15% on a reported basis and up 12% on a local currency basis. Growth was broad-based and benefited greatly from the new product revenue, which was very strong. Asia Pacific revenue was $79 million, up 12% in U.S. dollars and up 10% local currency. Europe's revenue was $75 million in 4Q 2017, up 17% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency. Both the U.K. and Spain saw strong growth across their credit businesses. Latin America's revenue is $55 million in 4Q 2017, up 16% in U.S. dollars and 19% in local currency. Growth was again led by our largest countries of Argentina and Chile. Canada's revenue was $36 million, up 18% in U.S. dollars and up 12% in local currency. Canada's growth was broad-based and reflects the strong performance showed throughout 2017. International's adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.3% in 4Q 2017, down from 30.3% a year ago. The year-to-year was driven principally by litigation accruals unrelated to the cybersecurity incident. Workforce Solutions revenue was $183 million in the quarter, up 6% when compared to 4Q 2016. The cybersecurity incident impacted revenue by approximately 3.5 points and impacted the discrete business of Employer Services and to a lesser degree, that of Verification Service. As the impact in EWS was more concentrated with government customers, we expect that will extend further into 2018 than with USIS. Excluding this impact, growth in 4Q was similar to 3Q 2017. Verification Services revenue was $126 million, up 11% with auto, consumer finance, government and talent solutions all delivering double-digit growth in the quarter. Employer Services revenue of $57 million was down 5% versus last year. Employer Services, excluding Workforce Analytics, was down approximately 3%. This is the portion of Employer Services impacted by the cybersecurity incident. And excluding this impact, we would have seen low single-digit growth. Workforce Analytics, the portion of the business that services employers and complying with the Affordable Care Act, was down about 10%. This was in line with our expectations for the quarter. Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margin was 45.5% in 4Q 2017, down 30 basis points from the 45.8% in 4Q 2016. Severance costs incurred in the quarter more than explained the decline in margin. Global Consumers Solutions revenue at $97 million in 4Q 2017 was down 2% on a reported basis and on a local currency basis. Revenue on the quarter was benefited by the ID Watchdog acquisition by about 4 points. Our U.S. consumer direct revenue declined almost 15% in the quarter as a result of the cybersecurity incident and the 3 TrustedID service we offer to consumers, we stopped marketing all U.S. direct-to-consumer revenue generating products in September. We therefore saw increased consumer churn levels in 4Q 2017. We do not intend to advertise our U.S. paid products in the first half of 2018. Our 4Q 2017 partner and reseller revenue in our Canadian consumer direct revenues were slightly higher than 4Q 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 32.4% in 4Q 2017, down about 2 points from 4Q 2016. In the fourth quarter, general corporate expense was $77 million. Excluding the nonrecurring costs associated with the cybersecurity incident in 2017, the adjusted general corporate expense for the quarter was $55 million, down about $2 million from 4Q 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margin for Equifax was 34.8%, down 170 basis points from 4Q 2016. Our GAAP effective tax rate was a 1.2% benefit in the quarter, reflecting the $48 million tax benefit from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the $2 million benefit from the income tax effect to stock awards. Excluding nonrecurring items, our 4Q 2017 effective tax rate using calculating adjusted EPS was 31.6%. In 4Q 2017, operating cash flow is $207 million in free cash flow, which includes $60 million of capital expenditures, was $147 million. For calendar year 2017, operating cash flow was $816 million and free cash flow, which includes $218 million of capital expenditures, was $598 million, down 1% and 8%, respectively. Cash outflow related to the cybersecurity incident, including capital spending, was about $85 million in 2017, heavily in the fourth quarter. Capital spending incurred in the quarter was $61 million for 2017, total capital spending was $218 million or just over 6% of revenue.  Total cash balance at year-end was $0.34 billion with total debt at year-end of $2.7 billion. Our net debt at year-end of about $2.37 billion was down $175 million from year-end 2016. Our gross leverage was 2.34x EBITDA and our net leverage was 2.05x EBITDA at year-end 2017, both down from 2016. Looking at operating results for 2017 in total. At a high level, revenue of $3.36 billion was up 7% in constant currency. Organic constant currency revenue growth was about 5%. We estimate that the cybersecurity incident negatively impacted revenue by just over 1 point. Adjusted EBITDA grew almost 10% to $1.24 billion and the adjusted EBITDA margin expanded about 100 basis points to 36.8%. Adjusted EPS was $5.97, up 8%. Again, this excludes both the nonrecurring costs related to the cybersecurity incident and the nonrecurring tax benefit from the 2017 tax reform. Now moving to guidance. In 2018, Equifax will be executing against the critical focus areas Paulino outlined earlier, as well as managing through the legal and regulatory issues related to the cybersecurity incident. To provide transparency into our financial performance, in addition to our GAAP results, we will be providing guidance in the following way. Our non-GAAP financial results will include all increased costs related to IT and data security that are ongoing or permanent in nature. We will exclude from our non-GAAP financial results both the incremental or bubble costs incurred to implement our IT and data security plans and the legal and or professional service cost being encourage specifically to address the litigation and governmental and regulatory investigations related to the cybersecurity incident. We will provide separate guidance as to the combined level of these costs. In terms of measurement, we have defined incremental IT and data security project costs that will be excluded from non-GAAP results to be limited to resource additions related to the projects being executed to address IT and data security; purchases of hardware, software or services to support projects being executed to address IT and data security; and when IT and data security projects are completed, put in service and stable, those costs will be deemed permanent and be included in non-GAAP financial results. Now on to our 2018 guidance. For 2018, at current exchange rates, we expect revenue to be between $3.425 billion and $3.525 billion reflecting growth of 2% to 5% with about 1% benefit from FX. U.S. mortgage market inquiries are expected to be down about 10% with the resulting revenue headwind of about 2%. We are expecting continued impact from the cybersecurity incident in 2018 with the greater impact in the first half. USIS is expected to have revenue growth percentage from flat to low single digits. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to decline up to 100 basis points. Workforce Solutions should have revenue growth percentage in the high single digits, approximately consistent with 2017. Adjusted EBITDA margin should be flat but up slightly. International should have revenue growth in the low double digits, but below the levels of 4Q 2017. Adjusted EBITDA margins should expand, but to a lesser degree than in 2017. Global consumer services should see revenue decline over 10%. U.S. consumer direct revenue will accelerate its decline and represent well under one-third of GCS revenue in 2018. Our current plans are based on the assumption that direct advertising and U.S. consumer will be minimal in 2018. The remainder of GCS is expected to deliver growth in 2018. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to decline significantly from 2017. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $5.80 and $6.00 a share with approximately $0.02 benefit from FX.  To provide a basis of comparison for 2018 adjusted EPS versus 2017, the following impacts outside of the business units may be helpful. Calendar year 2017 adjusted EPS of $5.97 reflects both a lower than target annual incentive plan payment to employees and an effective tax rate of 31.8%, well above the 27% we are forecasting for 2018. If you normalize 2017 for these two items, increasing AIP to target and lowering the effective tax rate to 27%, you would need to increase our 2017 adjusted EPS by approximately $0.15 a share. Ongoing cost related to IT and security, as well as costs related to the free services, including the Lock & Alert service we launched in January, are expected to be about $0.30 per share with the bulk of this cost increase in IT and security. Increased insurance costs will impact 2018 by approximately $0.10 per share. Over time, we would hope this increase insurance cost will decline. As Paulino indicated, our focus is to be a leader in IT and data security. Our investments in 2018 and 2019 will reflect this. And in 2018, we are expecting approximately $200 million of net incremental IT and data security project costs and legal and professional fees being encouraged specifically to address the litigation and governmental and regulatory investigations related to the cybersecurity incident. This represents gross cost of $275 million, offset by $75 million of insurance proceeds. Legal and professional fees related to litigation and regulation are expected to represent about 25% of this cost. These costs will be excluded from our non-GAAP financial results and guidance. If we are able to execute the IT and security projects more rapidly in 2018, we will do so. As a result, these cost assessments may increase. Our adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be generally at to slightly below the levels delivered in 4Q 2017. Capital spending is expected to be approximately 8% of revenue, above the 6% level in 2016 and 2017, reflecting increased spending for IT and data security. For 1Q 2018, at current exchange rates, we expect revenue to be between $850 million and $860 million, reflecting growth of 2% to 3% with about a 1% benefit from FX. Mortgage market increase are expected to be down approximately 5% with resulting headwinds to revenue growth of about 1%. Revenue growth in USIS and Workforce Solutions will be below the full-year levels discussed as we expect some continued impact from the cybersecurity incident in the first quarter. International growth will also be below the full-year expectation. Adjusted EPS was expected to be between $1.34 and $1.39 per share with approximately $0.01 of FX benefit. Gross cost for incremental IT and data security project costs and legal and professional fees being encouraged specifically to address the litigation and governmental and regulatory investigations related to the cybersecurity incident, which are excluded from our non-GAAP financial results are expected to be approximately $70 million. This amount will be reduced by any insurance recoveries in 1Q 2018.  Now let me hand it back to Paulino for some final comments. Paulino Barros : Thanks, John. We have made a lot of progress in the quarter addressing our commitment to consumers, customers, partners and regulators. The business units are executing well and our center of excellence providing strong support to all our efforts. However, there's still more work ahead of us and regaining our credibility with our constituencies, including our shareholders. The DNA of this company is underpinned with both, a deep commitment to strong ethical principles and values and a strong focus on execution. As I have mapped with our employees throughout the world, I sense a great level of enthusiasm and commitment to move this company forward with a heightened level of focus on protecting and safeguarding all of the consumer and commercial information we store and manage. And with that, operator, we will now open it up for questions. Jeff Dodge : Operator, I realize that the formal part of our presentation has been a bit longer than usual. We will stay past the 9 :30 stop that we would normally do, but I doubt that we will be able to get through the queue, and so I want to apologize in advance to those who were not able to get their questions out, but we will be available later today by phone. So, with that operator, could you activate the Q&A session please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first from Toni Kaplan, Morgan Stanley. Jeff Goldstein : Hi, this is Jeff Goldstein on for Toni. Thanks for taking my questions. Just now that we're almost 6 months since the breach, can you talk about how your conversations with customers have been evolving? Are the customer audits continuing? Or have you been more successful in converting new business? Do you think these audits are going to end soon? And on that topic, do you think any permanent share shift has occurred at this point? Paulino Barros : Our conversation continues to be very positive in this sense, as I explained the last quarter, coming from the emotional perspective to a more rational perspective. As you could imagine, we have been there in several hundreds of customers, talking to them about what happened, what caused, how it can help them actually to improve. Actually, the conversation runs about how we can improve their security system to be update in the areas that we're doing in improving our relationship. We have two customers that have a higher level of requirements for us to achieve, but it's not the majority of the customers. The most affected area in the company is the USIS; followed by Workforce Solution; and then, of course, GCS because the consumers, since we are not advertising anymore, we're not getting new consumers, and least in international. So, we haven't seen any specific share shift in the B2B side of the business. Of course, we have seen a degradation of the GCS consumer base, but nonmajor share shifting has happened so far. And as we continue to demonstrate our ability to understand and invest in our projects for the customers, the more closer they get to us and to the point they're now returning to acquire new services and products that we have. John Gamble : We did talk about the impact of the cybersecurity incident on revenue, obviously, in the third and fourth quarters, and we said there'd be a continuing impact in the first quarter. So that as those impacts are now transitioning over 6 to 7 months, clearly, you're seeing some movement in revenue because of the fact that we are seeing an impact to us, right? But again, as Paulino said, we think the progress is very good with our customers in terms of our conversations. Jeff Goldstein : That's helpful. Thank you. And then just within USIS in the quarter, revenue growth was only down modestly, but margins were down 260 basis points. So, I was just wondering if were there more operating investments this quarter maybe in light of the breach? Or is there just anything else to call out there to explain that margin decline with revenue growth only down modestly? Thanks. John Gamble : Really nothing specific, right? Obviously, the revenue at USIS is relatively rich. Mix shift can also affect it in the quarter. Our plans would have been built around assuming continued growth in USIS. So, since that didn't occur, we did have some elevated expense levels in the fourth quarter. And then, therefore, with the lower levels of revenue, we saw a bigger impact on margins than you saw in the third quarter. But nothing specific beyond that. Jeff Goldstein : Thanks a lot. Operator : We'll take our next question from Brett Huff, Stephens. Brett Huff : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Two, one big picture, and then one just sort of making sure we understand the numbers. Regarding sort of the numbers on USIS or the overall USIS business, some of your competitors were growing sort of mid-to-high single digits. You guys said were down minus 2%. Maybe it would have been 4% or 5% ex the breach. There's still a delta there between, I think, where your peers are and where you guys are in terms of growth. You mentioned you don't see any permanent share shift. Is the delta between those two numbers, the normalized number for you and sort of the peers, is that just a temporary delay? Or is that how we should continue to understand that, that revenue hasn't disappeared, it's just delayed? Is that right? John Gamble : So, in terms of the impact of the cyber incident, again, we're not talking about revenue impacts that will have lasted 6 to 7 months. I wouldn't consider that delayed. That's revenue that has been lost. So, that's how I think you should consider that revenue. In terms of comparing us, the 4% to 5% growth, again, the model we have had prior to this, and I'm not reestablishing the model here, but I'm using it as a reference point.  The prior model we had for USIS was somewhere between 5% and 7%. So, to the extent taking these effects into account and excluding them, obviously, and adjusting for mortgage, if we're somewhere near 5% given the environment we're in right now and the effects of the cybersecurity incident that might be difficult to measure, I don't think 4% to 5% is that bad. Brett Huff : Okay. And then the second question is just on the cost. I want to make sure I understand. You're spending money, and then determining kind of which ones are going to be ongoing and which ones sort of taper. Once you determine the expenses that are going to be going, that's when you roll it into, including that cost in your pro forma EPS. Is that, am I hearing that right? John Gamble : That's correct. So, in terms of when something is going to be considered nonrecurring, we're measuring it against specific project definition. So, the project has to be defined and agreed upfront and generally, some type of deployment or implementation. And when that occurs or in some cases, elimination. A significant part of the spending is around elimination of systems, not the addition of new. And when those projects are completed and then put into service and stable, then we make them ongoing. And it's only the cost of getting them into service and stable that we will exclude and consider nonrecurring. Brett Huff : Great. Thanks for the clarifications. Operator : We'll go next to Gary Bisbee, Royal Bank of Canada. Gary Bisbee : Yes, thanks. Let me just follow up on that last one, can you give us any kind of an estimate what the increase would be in the ongoing expense once all the stuff you're - the projects you just referenced that will be excluded now go into - once the things are turned on? I mean, should we think that's another step-up in 2019? Or is it just too hard to know at this point? John Gamble : So, we gave you a specific number for 2018. I can't give you a number beyond 2018. But in general, I think the way we think about it is to the extent we're successful, a reasonable portion of what we're doing results in system simplification. And since that's the case, the simplification should actually help drive IT costs down. Now there will be some increased costs for data security over time that will continue to escalate as we go forward. We expect that to be permanent. It was happening even before the cybersecurity incident. But a significant portion of the expenditure is around simplification, which that simplification will also hopefully drive lower IT costs in the future. If you look at our total IT cost as a percent of revenue, we spend at a healthy rate today. So, there's opportunity there. Gary Bisbee : Okay, great. And then just thinking about revenue, I guess, a two-part question. I think you said that the bookings trends improved somewhat during the quarter. Can we get some more color on that and what's happening there? And then can you help us frame - when bookings do sort of normalize at some point, how long does it take to ramp back up to the type of growth you would have been at? I mean, it strikes me if you lose a lot of the bookings momentum for 6 to 12 months, that there's another probably 12 months after that to sort of refill the pipeline and whatnot, and so it would be a slow build back. Is that right? Thank you. John Gamble : So, I think the first part of your question is effectively how do we determine the value that we're indicating for the impact of the cybersecurity incident on revenue. And basically, the way we do that is we take a look at transactions that we could see had a reasonable likelihood of executing. And then we know a reasonable rate where those would have converted in the past and when that rate is substantially lower than we would have normally seen looking forward, we would attribute that to the cybersecurity incident. And that's how we did it. It's the same thing we did in the third quarter. Looking forward in terms of looking at 2018, we've given guidance for USIS for 2018. So, the best thing I can point you at is the guidance we've given for 2018. And as we move through the year, we'll talk more about how we're seeing the revenue performance progress. And then we'll talk more about how we're seeing new product deployments occur, which we've done historically. So, I think you'll be able to get a view based on those discussions as we go forward. Gary Bisbee : Alright, thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Andrew Jeffrey, SunTrust. Andrew Jeffrey : Hi guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, I'm trying to ascertain, Paulino, you talked about a few growth initiatives where you're really focused and enthusiastic. I'm thinking about in the U.S. this year, fraud, ID, enhanced marketing offerings, et cetera. Can you just comment on sort of where we are in terms of NPI, vitality or momentum and how much the long-term effect, if any, disruption in the strong NPI growth that we've seen over the last few years informs the structural growth opportunity for Equifax, recognizing that vintages build on each other? I just wonder how much of a disruption we've seen in the new product initiative growth drivers. John Gamble : Paulino is going to address the specifics. But just to remember what we've said historically, right, is that we do expect to see deferral in the NPI pipeline as we go into 2018 because, obviously, we are taking a significant amount of resource and focusing it on IT and data security. So, you will see some of that, and it will result in a lengthening of the time period it takes us to develop and deploy new products. But I think Paulino can talk about it more. Paulino Barros : Yes. If you look at the numbers that we achieved in 2017, right, the number of products that we have in the pipeline and the number of products that we launched. Our cycle is usually 18 months, right - 12 to 18 months to launch a product. [Indiscernible] the digital products more and the network products. Fortunately, we will enter 2018 with 107 new products in the pipeline, which will help us in the next 18 to 24 months. As we mentioned before, as we learn in this process, right, it takes that long first to fix the issues and to improve to a different level what we have here in the company. So, as John mentioned, we are moving some of the resources that we have to make sure that we improve our security and IT, as we mentioned. Now we still have part of it that we will continue to work in new products. And we continue to work in acquisitions. We continue to be looking for new opportunities. Again, John mentioned correctly. And as we've said last time, we are taking resources and initially were used to NPI towards making sure that we execute and do it right and fast on the IT and security areas. John Gamble : Long, long term to a private question. To the extent we're successful as we simplify the systems based on the investments we're making, then that should also be beneficial to new products, as we pointed out. But again, that's after you're completed. Andrew Jeffrey : And have you seen any disruption Rest of World, recognizing that international markets were less impacted by the breach? Or is some of the initiatives, exporting Cambrian and so forth, are those relatively uninterrupted? Paulino Barros : Definitely, customer base. But if you - at the end of the day, Canada has been a very small impact. U.K. has been growing. Europe has been growing. Spain, a very important growth for us last year. Adopting, maybe because they're kind of one phase behind the U.S. launching new products and we're trying to expand one of the efforts that has been made in this company for years now is to expand our global platform, which has helped us significantly. Like, if products change, Cambrian and eventually, we will take InstaTouch outside of the U.S. So, to a lesser extent, we see that. But also important is the fact that a lot of the NPI that is driven by - that are driven by international are local as well. So, we have seen significant - actually, international continues to be one of the engines of this company for growth because they're NPI-based programs. Andrew Jeffrey : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to David Togut, Evercore ISI. David Togut : Thank you, good morning. You indicated that the negative impact of the breach receded throughout the quarter, both in USCIS and Workforce Solutions. I'm wondering, as you look at the linearity of the quarter, particularly in USCIS, did you actually return to growth in that business in the month of December? John Gamble : Yes. We don't break things really down by month in terms of our public disclosures. But again, the reason we said that we saw improvement as we went through the quarter in terms of the performance of those businesses related to the cybersecurity incident is, we began to deliver at a better pace versus the forecast that we've had for ourselves in areas that were impacted by the cybersecurity incident. So, we saw a lessening of the impact that we have expected as we moved through the quarter. David Togut : Understood. And then in terms of WS, you've indicated that you continue to have conversations with governments to restart that business a bit. Can you flesh out how those conversations are going? And are there any milestones we can track from our perspective to know how you're progressing in EWS as you go through 2018? John Gamble : Are you referring to Workforce Solutions? David Togut : Yes, Workforce Solutions. Paulino Barros : Yes, Again, I think that we have - especially for the verification side, we have several government agencies that use our services, right? It's definitely a very sensitive area, and we have to move with a lot of caution and to make sure that we regain the trust and confidence of these customers. We have been working on that. Rudy Ploder and myself have been at those customers, talking to them, explaining to them, offering for them to comment and see what we have implemented to audit our process as well to make sure that we can rebuild our trust with this segment of the industry. John Gamble : It's important to keep in mind, as we've mentioned, Verification Services performed well in the quarter. And as we've indicated, we expect it to continue to perform very well. So, Verification Services, which is the engine of growth and margin in that business and continues to perform well. We continue to add contributors to the database. So, we're quite happy with the performance of Verification Services as we look into 2018 and move through the year. We did indicate that for the first quarter, you'll see EWS to be a little weaker than the full year number. But overall, Verification Services is performing well. David Togut : Understood. Quick final one. You're indicating GCS will likely return to growth in 2019. What underlies that conviction? John Gamble : Yes. In terms of specific guidance beyond 2018, we're not going to give specific guidance beyond 2018. David Togut : Thank you very much. Operator : We'll go next to George Mihalos with Cowen and Company. Allison Jordan : Good morning. This is Allison Jordan in for George. Thank you for taking my question. John, I know you laid out increased costs related to IT and data security when you detailed guidance. Can you help us think about how we should model corporate expense line in 2018 and the growth there? John Gamble : In terms of the specific line item itself, most of those areas that I indicated had increased costs will impact the corporate line. So that's where you should model them. And also, the insurance cost, most of that cost will hit the corporate line. So, we should model that as well, but beyond that, no, nothing specific. We did also indicate obviously in the discussion that bonus accruals were down, so those should increase. So, all of those items should affect your corporate line. But in terms of specific guidance on corporate, we don't provide guidance by line item. Allison Jordan : Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And then just one quick follow-up. Online Information Solutions exited the year basically flat in terms of revenue growth. It seems like that business is poised to return to growth. Can you help us think about the outlook for OIS in 2018? John Gamble : Yes. Again, so we gave guidance for the USIS in total. So, the specific line item guidance, we don't really provide. Allison Jordan : Okay, thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Manav Patnaik : Thank you, good morning guys. My first question is just more around the future of the direct consumer segment. Maybe can you just give us a sense of how many people actually signed on to the free TrustedID product you're providing and maybe how well it's running? Because personally, the experience here hasn't been too great. I mean, I guess, compared to at least the experience in TransUnion. Once we all signed onto, I don't think we've heard at all from TrustedID. So, I was just curious how that's performing. And do you guys actually think of speeding up the marketing spend in the second half of the year? John Gamble : So, in terms of TrustedID, we think the performance, at this point, has been relatively good, right? We believe the call center support has been very good, and we're not hearing, at this point, that there are significant issues around TrustedID. To the extent you have specific issues with TrustedID, obviously, we are very interested in hearing what they are because we work to address them. We continue to invest in the service and to try to make it better because, obviously, the people that signed up deserve to have the best service we can possibly provide. Can you give me your second question again? Manav Patnaik : Well, just the number of people that signed on for it and how should we think of the future of that segment. Like, how much do you spend on it? John Gamble : So, you're referring to GCS specifically? Manav Patnaik : Yes. John Gamble : So, in terms of the total number of people that have enrolled in TrustedID, that's not a number we disclose. In terms of GCS, I think as Paulino mentioned, for this year, we're not going to be advertising in the U.S. consumer segment in the first half of the year. And we indicated that the amount of advertising for the full year is expected to be relatively low. But in terms of specific plans for the segment, in general, I think that's something we're still working. And then we'll give you updates on that as we move through the year and make those determinations. Manav Patnaik : Okay, fair enough. Paulino Barros : Our focus will be to launch the Lock & Alert service, right, to make sure that we deliver in our commitment at November last and make sure that the consumers have a great level of service in that area. Manav Patnaik : Got it. And then just my second question is more, I think in the 10-K, you mentioned you're making a lot of strategic changes to your executive leadership team. I was just hoping you could give us a little bit more detail on what you've moved around and what's going on there? Paulino Barros : I think you're referring to the inclusion of the seasonal reporting to me. So, this happened actually in the third quarter since - actually, a couple weeks after I arrived here. We have made a few changes at that time, which included the separation of the chief information security office from the - under the IT and reporting directly to the CEO. And also creating the chief transformation office area to make sure that we address all the issues related to the cybersecurity incident and respond to the cybersecurity incident with a focus to let the business units to continue to be focused on the business side and creating one area that can provide support for the cybersecurity incident, resources and actions. John Gamble : Yes. And I think in Paulino's prepared remarks, right, there was a substantial amount of discussion around the specific governance structures that have been created, including risk office, tech committee and other areas, that strengthen governance around security, as well as drive culture around security more than just technology. So that is a fair amount of detail there. Manav Patnaik : Okay. Thanks guys. Operator : We'll go next to George Tong, Goldman Sachs. George Tong : Hi, thanks, good morning. Paulino, I'd like to dig deeper into the revenue impact from the breach. Can you elaborate on whether prior new business deferrals have translated into revenues at this point and how the breach impact on revenue will play out as you move through 2018? Paulino Barros : As I mentioned on the transcript, right, our performance - third quarter was tough because there was a lot of negative energy around and unknowns around. And as we move to fourth quarter, there were - we have more time to prepare and to be able to reach out to customers and work with them, explaining what happened, how it worked and the actions that we put in place in order to remediate and build the future. We have seen - as we mentioned earlier, we have seen a lesser impact at the end of the fourth quarter. As we continue to work with the customers and demonstrate to them our improved [indiscernible] and the fact that, actually, we are raising the standards of what we want to operate, which is a - was very well welcomed by the financial institutions area. We are, of course, coming from cybersecurity incident. So therefore, we're being very careful on how we forecast our numbers to make sure that we don't break our tradition to be very close to execution reality, like we have been in the last 12 years. George Tong : Got it, okay. And I guess the earlier question, how you expect the breach impact on revenues to play out as you move through 2018, is that mainly a first half headwind that you expect, and then it fully dissipates by the second half? Paulino Barros : I don't think it will be that black and white. John Gamble : I think we'll just have to tell you as we move through the year, right? We're certainly expecting an impact. Our planning would assume that it will be greater in the first half than the second half. But obviously, as we move through the year, we'll just try to keep you updated because it's obviously a fluid situation. But we are making progress. Paulino Barros : Yes. George Tong : Got it. And then, John, you indicated that you expect $200 million in net IT legal and professional fees that are onetime in nature. Can you flesh out your expectation for ongoing costs related to the breach and how you expect EBITDA margins - adjusted EBITDA margins to trend as you move through the year? John Gamble : So, in terms of specific trending on March, we gave first quarter guidance and full-year guidance. And in my prepared remarks, we did talk a bit about the expenses we expected to incur in 2018 specifically related to security, and then also that we expected to incur specifically related to insurance. And that was in the prepared remarks. So, I think that detail is there, so you should be able to use that in your estimates. George Tong : Right. Well, I guess, the question was around when you expect the ongoing costs to be essentially executed. When do you expect your investments to be made as you move through the year? Is it going to be front-end loaded or back-end loaded as you make your ongoing investments? John Gamble : I'd say the ongoing investments are going to occur over the year., but in terms of the exact timing of when individual activities will get executed, I can't give you an estimate on that. George Tong : Okay, got. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Shlomo Rosenbaum, Stifel. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, thank you for taking my questions. I want to ask a little bit about GCS. There was talk about not marketing in the first half of 2018. It sounds like there will be marketing direct-to-consumer in the second half of 2018. At the same time, there's kind of a discussion of strategically trying to figure out what to do with that business. Can you give us just a little bit more color on that? Is the thought to when the 12 months of free monitoring is up, to go ahead and offer something for that\u2019s a paid subscription? Or is there just a thought of migrating this to a different provider? Or can you just give us some thoughts on that? John Gamble : Yes. Look, and it's a very - I certainly understand the reason for the question. And at this point in time, I think we just need to go back to the comments we made in the prepared remarks, which is we'll be able to - we'll give you more detail on how we're going to move ahead with the GCS business as we move through the year. But what we've indicated is that no advertising or marketing spend in the first half. We expected limited for the full year so that would indicate limited for the second half, and that's the way the planning base is built. But we'll - as we move through this year, we'll provide you with more information should anything change and as we get more specifics around that business, okay? Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. And then as a follow-up, just in terms of the revenue in the quarter. It was actually - it did not decline that much. And I was wondering if your partners and resellers had a big bump in the fourth quarter, due to the cybersecurity breach. So, although your own direct-to-consumer business suffered from churn, but those that you're selling data to actually had a benefit from that, and they're purchasing it from you. John Gamble : So not so much - the biggest benefit we got, obviously, in the quarter was really ID Watchdog, right, so the purchase of ID Watchdog. We got the full effect of the revenue from that purchase in the fourth quarter, so that was certainly beneficial. And then also, we've seen relatively good performance in Canada related to - in our GCS business in Canada, so you saw some benefit there. And those were two significant drivers. We also - this is the quarter in which we lapped our - the change in contract with Credit Karma. So that was a benefit to us in the period simply because we lapped the contract period year-on-year. So, I'd say those are the three things that probably affected GCS outside of the U.S. consumer business more than anything else. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Alright, thank you very much. Operator : We'll go next to Tim McHugh, William Blair. Tim McHugh : Just a follow-up a little on the - or consumer business. Can you talk about the margins? I guess I think your comment was they'd be down a couple hundred basis points, which, I guess, given the revenue weakness, is understandable. But you also talked about minimal advertising expense. So, can you kind of walk through the puts and takes with that? And just trying to understand, as you do start advertising, how to think about the margins of the business. John Gamble : Yes. So, I think you kind of just did the puts and takes, right? So, obviously, we had a reasonable revenue decline. And then the most significant offset was related to the fact that we didn't have - that the marketing expense was obviously substantially declined for the worldwide. There was some marketing expense outside the U.S., but very minimal. So, and those were really the most substantial puts and takes regarding the margins of the business report. Tech spend was up a little bit because we're investing in Lock & Alert and TrustedID deployments, which would be incremental, too, which you'd normally see in that business because those are both - those both won't generate any revenue. But that - those are the general puts and takes that you see in that business right now. Tim McHugh : Okay. And then just, I guess, two smaller ones. One, can you talk at all about the Mercury acquisition? I guess how big is it? And a little more information about it. And then on the tax rate, I guess, can you talk through - I thought it would be probably a little lower. But what are the puts and takes there, as well as - not to add a [indiscernible] on that, but the adjusted tax rate has typically been lower than the GAAP tax rate. I guess I assume the 27% was more the GAAP number, but can you talk about that at all? Thanks. John Gamble : Okay. So, Mercury, it's a relatively small business, right, in Australia. I don't think we specifically disclosed the revenue size. But it's a relatively small business, and it's generally related to the onboarding, employee services, employee onboarding and assisting companies in onboarding and new employees. So, it's somewhat consistent with the types of business we would have in our Workforce Solutions business in the U.S. It's also consistent with the type of business we would have in Australia. You might want to say more. Paulino Barros : Correct, yes. Well, actually, it just happened when I was doing this in Australia, we're finishing up the process. And it's a very unique, small business, a tuck-in, that we had in the area of employment side. We believe that this can help us in the future in the area to implement or to deploy our Workforce Solutions - The Work Number in Australia as well. This was a strategic move, a very unique company, very well positioned in Australia that we thought it was going to be of strategic value for us in the future. John Gamble : In terms of tax rate. So, the 27% communicated is a little higher than you expected. So, there are still a fair number of the application of the Tax Act outside of the U.S., and certain circumstances are still unclear. So as those items are resolved, there's an opportunity for our tax rate to adjust. I would guess that based on the open items that are out there, if it's going to adjust, it would probably adjust down. But that's still not sure. But - so if it looks a little higher than you would expect, then I think it's probably driven by the fact that there's a fair number of uncertainties around the treatment of some specific tax items outside the U.S. As those become more clear, we can get more specific on the tax rate. Tim McHugh : And then just is that a GAAP, is that the GAAP rate? Or is that the adjusted rate after we take into account kind how you apply taxes to the add-backs? John Gamble : I think that should be approximately our GAAP and adjusted rate. They should be similar. Tim McHugh : Okay. Thanks. Operator : We'll go next to Kevin McVeigh, Deutsche Bank. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Thanks. You made a couple of comments about expanding into the rental market as part of real estate. And just if I heard right, just no benefit from trended data. Can you just talk about those two items a little bit more? John Gamble : Yes. And I'm sorry, just on the last question. So, there are adjustments. Obviously, the tax effects of the sale of the execution of employee stock options, et cetera, those benefits, we don't take in our non-GAAP rate, which do affect GAAP, right. So, my apologies for missing that in the last answer. So, can you ask your question again? Kevin McVeigh : Yes, of course. The market opportunity for the rental market, be on mortgage in real estate. And then if I heard right, it sounded like you're lapping the benefit of trended data on the mortgage side. Are we through that at this point? Or just any thoughts on that as well. John Gamble : Let me just kill off the second one real quick. So trended data, yes. So trended data, we launched trended data a year ago in August, right? So, for fourth quarter, there was no trended data in 2016 or 2017 in mortgage. Paulino Barros : Yes, on the rental side, we actually expanded this vertical. Given our success and understanding of the mortgage side, we expanded - we call this vertical no housing, which includes both, mortgage and rental, which provides a great opportunity. We have very little penetration in this market, and we have already made some strides towards it. We brought some experts in the area to work with us, and we believe there is a great opportunity for us to expand in the future. Kevin McVeigh : Got it. And then, John, any thoughts on when you return to buybacks? John Gamble : No specific guidance at this point in time. Right now, what we're focused on is executing the plan that Paulino laid out and the IT and security actions that we discussed. Kevin McVeigh : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Bill Warmington, Wells Fargo. Bill Warmington : Good morning everyone. You mentioned that the negative revenue impact from the cyber breach improved throughout Q4. Has that trend continued throughout Q1? John Gamble : Yes. Certainly, we're not going to talk really specifically about Q1 at this point, right? And again, just to make sure I was clear in what I said, right, it was - what we said is the impact expected from the cyber breach in the specific business lessened as we moved through the quarter, right? So, it's a statement relative to our own expectation. Bill Warmington : Right, right. Okay. And then a follow-up question. Are you seeing a return of the project-related revenue, specifically the revenue that had been put off as a result of the cyber security audits? John Gamble : Yes. So, I think Paulino addressed this a little bit earlier, right, which is as we move through and we work with, with varying customers through the process that they have to make sure that they're comfortable with the cyber IT and data security actions we're taking. As we complete those reviews with a given customer, then we see that the process changes, and then our ability to sell discrete projects, as well as new products improves. And as we make progress with our customer base through that process, and we are making progress, then we see the opportunities to continue to sell new products. And then also, those discrete projects improves with time, and we are seeing that occur. Paulino Barros : Yes. And like I mentioned at the beginning, the more rational that we get about the process and the more that we make progresses within our remediation and investment program in IT and security-related areas, the more we expect this progress to continue. But at this time, it's not a trend. Bill Warmington : Okay. Excellent. Thank you for the insights. Paulino Barros : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our final question from Andrew Steinerman, JPMorgan. Andrew Steinerman : Hi, John. Before you were talking, you mentioned you are going to formally restate at least part of the long-term algorithm about USIS. And I look at Page 30 of the 10-K and I see the multiyear algorithm stated and somewhat revised, 6% to 8% organic plus 1% to 2% revenue growth. And then the language that I think is revived is EPS growing faster than revenue growth over time due to operational leverage and financial leverage. Obviously, the old goal was 10% to 13%. So, my question is, now post-breach, is there a different view about operating leverage? And I just want to make sure since it's in the 10-K that 6% to 8% organic growth for medium term is being restated today as the goal. John Gamble : Okay. We're - Andrew, we're looking for that. Andrew Steinerman : Page 30 of the 10-K. John Gamble : Sorry - we're - how about we just - and I apologize here. We're not able to find where you're seeing that. Andrew Steinerman : Over the long term, it starts. It's under business environment and company outlook. It's the second paragraph. John Gamble : Andrew, we don't see it here, so we'll have to take it off-line. So, we're not sure what you're referring to, okay? So, we'll maybe ... Andrew Steinerman : Okay. Thank you. John Gamble : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And at this time, I'd like to turn it back to Jeff Dodge for closing remarks. Jeff Dodge : Okay. I'd like to thank everybody for their time and their interest. And with that, operator, we'll terminate the call. Operator : That concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Trevor Burns. Please go ahead, sir. Trevor Burns : Thanks and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Trevor Burns, Investor Relations. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; Paulino Barros; John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Dodge, Investor Relations. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our Web site at www.equifax.com. During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risk factors, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in our filings with the SEC, including our 2017 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. Also, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance. For the first quarter of 2017, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes, among other things, acquisition-related amortization expense, and the income tax effects of stock awards recognized upon vesting or settlement. Adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax also excludes certain costs related to the cybersecurity incident. These include cost to investigate the cybersecurity incident, legal and professional services and a contingent liability for costs associated with providing free credit file monitoring and identity theft protection services to consumers. Included with cost related to the cybersecurity incident and therefore excluded from adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax of the incremental non-recurring project cost designed to enhance IT and data security. This includes projects to implement systems and processes to enhance our IT and data security infrastructure, as well as projects to replace and substantially consolidated our global networking systems, as well as the cost to manage these projects. These projects that will transform our IT infrastructure and further enhance our IT and data security are expected to occur throughout 2018 and 2019. Adjusted EBITDA is defined at net income attributable to Equifax adding back interest expense net of interest income, depreciation and amortization, income tax expense, and also as is the case for adjusted EPS, excluding certain one-time items including costs related to the cyber security incident. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our Web site. In the Form 10-Q, to be filed later today, we will disclose the future losses from litigation or reasonably possible but not yet estimable at this early stage in the proceedings. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark. Mark Begor : Thanks, Trevor, and good morning everyone. I think as all of you know, I joined Equifax last week, so I'm into week two here at Equifax. It's exciting for me to join my first Equifax earnings call. And most importantly, take the helm of Equifax at such a pivotal time in our history. I want to start my comments by assuring consumers and customers of my absolute commitment, as well as our team's absolute commitment, to making Equifax a leader in IT and data security, to protect the sensitive consumer and customer data with which we have been entrusted, and to empower individuals to understand and manage personal data. I also want to take a minute to thank Paulino for the outstanding job he did as interim CEO and for continuing to be a part of our leadership team into early 2019. During Paulino's time as CEO Equifax has made significant progress in four areas of focus outlined as critical to our success in transforming Equifax following the cybersecurity incident. And those four elements are : Number one, to protect and empower consumers. Number two, become an industry leader in data security and identity protection while transforming our IT infrastructure and data security to industry leadership levels. John will talk about the sizable investments in this are in the first quarter and in 2018. Third, rebuild confidence with customers and partners, and I'll talk a little bit about our progress there. And fourth, respond to and work with the government and other regulatory bodies as they investigate the incident. In the fourth quarter earnings call, in early March, Paulino and John covered in detail our plans and progress across these areas. Ensuring continued consistent execution in this transformation in this massive infrastructure investment that we're making is critical to the success of Equifax, and has my personal commitment as well as the focus of the entire Equifax team. I came to Equifax two weeks ago because I believe in the business. I believe in the strategy and I believe in the team. Equifax's strategy over the past decade has been based on the sound yet simple principle of combining industry-leading analytics and machine learning, unique credit income and asset-based data, and customer-specific data to be a leader in creating new analytical products that solve customer problems in financial decisioning, identify verification, fraud identification, and human resource processes. My experiences at GE and Warburg, including my two years on the FICO board position me well to take over this leadership role and help lead the transformation to deliver industry-leading IT and data security, improve customer support in customer-leading products and services. I'm convinced we have the opportunity to make Equifax again the leader in providing data-driven insights to our customers and deliver a great future for Equifax customers, consumers, employees, communities, and shareholders. It's that opportunity that drew me to Equifax, and I'm energized and excited to get going. In my first 90 days as Equifax CEO I'll work closely with my team to immerse myself in the business, and that's already underway. As I do this, I'll prioritize my efforts in a few critical areas of our transformation. Number one, employee engagement in the team, delivering on commitments Equifax has made to consumers and customers requires that we fully engage our talented workforce and leadership team, deepen and expand that talent, particularly in IT and data security. And I think you know we're taking very aggressive steps there to improve the leadership team. And also bring new technologies in that we're deploying as a part of our IT transformation. I believe in our leadership team. They have deep domain. They understand our products, our customers, and technology. And I'm really excited about some of the new members of the leadership team. I think you know a few weeks ago, before I arrived, we brought in a world-class CISO leader, Jamil Farshchi, from Home Depot, and we're very close to landing a new CTO to bring into the business from another leading company. Number two, execution in our critical IT and data security and IT transformation initiatives. This includes the continued focus on ensuring Equifax strengthens its security first culture with supporting governance. It also includes a focus on people and talent acquisition in these highly competitive areas. And we're being very aggressive about attracting the absolute best talent in the IT and data security space. We're investing heavily to ensure we are market leaders around data security, and we will also enhance the transparency of all our transformation efforts with all our constituents, our customers, consumers, and the public as we drive this transformation forward. Number three, strengthening customer and partner relationships and reestablishing trust in Equifax as a premier partner. I'm already out meeting with customers. I had a meeting two weeks ago. I've actually got a dinner tonight with a customer and another one tomorrow in Boston. Engaging with customers is a critical priority to me and our leadership team. We're all out there spending time to customers to regain their trust and confidence in our business and in the initiatives that we're taking to enhance our data, and data security and IT infrastructure. Number four, strengthening consumer support, both in processes and technology. And importantly, building a culture focused on continuously improving customer support. This is another area that's central to me in my nine years leading the Synchrony Financial business at GE when it was a part of GE, that B2C interaction with customers was critical to me, and it's one of the many things I'm going to be bringing to Equifax. I'll also focus time and meeting with our shareholders in getting your input on our performance and our direction. I expect to begin those meetings in the coming weeks. Engaging with shareholders is a big priority for me, and I look forward to meeting with you in the coming weeks and months. First quarter was a solid start to the year for Equifax. We made positive progress in the quarter and our focus areas for improving IT and data security, improving consumer support with the launch of Lock & Alert, as well as importantly, in progress with our customers and our financial performance. I'll walk through the highlights of the quarter, and then John will take you through the details on our results. Total revenue for the quarter was $866 million, up 4% on a reported basis and up 3% on a local currency basis versus last year. Adjusted EPS was $1.43, down 1% versus last year. Both revenue and adjusted EPS were above our guidance range and better than our expectations. So we feel some really positive momentum coming out of the first quarter. USIS revenue was down 1% versus last year, consistent with the guidance we provided in March. Total online revenue was down about 2%. Marketing services was down slightly, although importantly we saw continued growth in credit marketing services. Trey and his team are making great progress with working with our customers regarding the reviews following the cybersecurity incident. I've been part of many of those. We have institutionalized more formal customer communications. We're holding regular updates with both security and the non-security leaders from our customers. And I've been a part of those also. In the period after the breach customers were naturally focused on the incident and rebuilding confidence and trust. While that is still a central priority and topic of discussion with our customers, we're also seeing then increasingly willing to reopen discussions with us about new business opportunities, and our pipeline is strengthening for both new applicable [ph] core and new products. Our customers are focused on our investments in data security and infrastructure, but they also want to get back to a normal growth discussion with us. We continue to have success moving our customers to that normal position around new and expanded business. This allows us to better engage in new products as well as the credit marketing service transactions we've discussed in both third quarter '17 and fourth quarter '17 earnings calls. Our Workforce Solutions business had a very solid quarter with revenue up 6% versus last year, slightly better than we expected. Importantly, verifier revenue was up a strong 12% driven by the strong growth across governments, talent solutions, mortgage, and debt management. Employer Services was down 3%. So Workforce Solutions and Rudy and his team had a very solid quarter in the first quarter. John and the international team had another strong quarter with revenue up 13% on a reported basis and 9% on a local currency basis slightly stronger than our expectations. Latin America and Asia Pacific had their double-digit local currency revenue growth in European credit operations in Canada continue to serve strong single digit local currency growth. Lastly European debt services declined in the quarter specifically in our venture with U.K. government. Global consumer revenue was down 3% on reported basis and down 4% on local currency basis, a slightly better performance than we had expected. U.S. consumer direct revenue declined 21% in the quarter again within expectations as we indicated last quarter, we will not be doing any advertising in our U.S. Consumer Direct business through at least the second quarter 2018 and therefore we will see continued decline in revenue driven by customer churn. We expect to make a decision on the U.S. Consumer Direct business over the next over the coming quarters. This decline was partially offset by growth in our reseller business and the Canadian Consumer Direct business as we have seen continued growth in these two operations and also our ID watchdog acquisition performed well in the first quarter. While our first priority must be to deliver our IT and data security and IT transformation commitments and to continue to improve customer support, it's also a critical importance that we get the broader team at Equifax back to focusing on the essential operations, operating practices that will drive us to move back to a leadership position in delivering new products and insights to our customers. So I'm spending a lot of my time both balancing on the infrastructure of data security investments they're making but even as importantly working with our teams to get back to focusing on customer growth. New product innovation or NPI has consistently been a growth lever for Equifax and is off to a strong start in 2018, despite being impacted as we focus project management and technology resources on IT and data security, we're tracking to plan with a consistent number of NPI launches versus last year which is good news. Several of the new products we believe has strong revenue potential and NPI will be a strong focus in the second quarter and in the future for all of us at Equifax. Our global data and analytics practices is critical to NPI and leveraging Cambrian Ignite direct and Ignite marketplace to advance our capabilities and combining Equifax public and customer data utilizing sophisticated analytical techniques to deliver industry leading insights. We now employed Cambrian in four major geographies, the U.S., Canada, Australia and most recently Argentina we quickly followed Cambrian deployments with global deployments of customer facing Ignite Direct and Ignite marketplace, these solutions which are based on Cambrian capabilities provide clients with Premier data in advanced analytics in support of full analytic lifecycle from data access to insight development and deployment. Cambrian Ignite Solutions routinely incorporate machine learning into customer decisioning, an example of how we're using machine learning to improve results is our Patent Pending Neuro Decision Technology or NDT, NDT is the first regulatory compliance machine learning credit scoring system reviewed by regulators and credit scoring experts. This technology develops a neural network model that improves performance and accuracy and gives customers the ability to make more informed decisions when assessing risk. This unique process is important to customers and regulators and enable the deep learning of customer behavior is applicable and deployable wherever traditional score cards are appropriate. So we're excited about this new technology. In the first quarter, we also launched an extension of FraudIQ in the U.S. which allows us to better identify bust out fraud which we all know is in increasing industry problem. FraudIQ utilizes unique machine learning techniques which will address this growing industry issue. Launch of Cambrian Ignite in Argentina demonstrate the progress we're making to deploy Cambrian Data in analytics platform globally, the Ignite solution is providing customers in Argentina with access to more data bringing our data together with our customers data and enabling faster and improved decisioning. We're also employing NDT in Argentina to enhance the performance of customers scoring models in that area. Other drivers in NPI revenue in 2018 continue to include InstaTouch, Digital IV, ID and Fraud and a variety of new such solutions in the housing and auto verticals. Continuing to ramp up NPI new product efforts with our customers will be a critical priority for me and our entire team in the second quarter and beyond. I and the entire leadership team at Equifax are committed to delivering on the critical objectives discussed today and in the past quarters. We're committed to regaining the consumers and confidence and how we manage and secure information. We're also committed to regaining the trust of our customers and partners. This is the priority for the team and a priority for me personally. And making Equifax the industry leader in IT and data security while delivering new products that deliver unit insides that allow our customers to execute against their most value creating opportunities is critical to Equifax. I'm excited to be at the and here at Equifax and excited to be part of the team and I'm excited about the path forward for Equifax. I support the team strategy. I support the leadership team. The first quarter is a solid start to 2018. We have a lot of work to do and we're making very strong progress. With that, let me hand it over to John. John Gamble : Thanks, Mark and good morning everyone. As before I'll generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis. For 2018 additional items excluded from our non-GAAP results or the onetime costs related to the cybersecurity incident. We'll provide the details on those items you can consider at your analysis. In total in 1Q, '18 we incurred non-recurring cost related to the cybersecurity incident of $79 million. These have been partly offset by insurance recoveries of $10 million resulting in a net non-recurring charge of $69 million. The non-recurring charges excluded from adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted EPS. $29 million of gross costs were generally for legal fees and other professional services principally related to outstanding litigation and government investigations related to the cybersecurity incident, $46 million were generally for one time incremental project and other costs incurred to implement our IT and data security plans improve our infrastructure and develop and launch the lock-and-alert free service launched in 1Q, '18. Going forward, all operating costs related to lock-and-alert will be included in our ongoing P&L. $4 million in accrued and incurred gross expenses related to the trust at IT premier service we offered free to all citizens. Give up cost were offset by about $10 million of insurance recoveries committed in 1Q, '18. Total non-recurring in onetime thing incremental project and other gross costs incurred since 3Q, '17 related to the cybersecurity incident are $243 million. We have a $125 million of cybersecurity insurance under our E&L policy against which we received commitments to pay $60 million in recoveries today which partially offsets the cost reference above. We continue to expect to made claims the fully utilized policy. For Equifax in 1Q, '18 as Mark indicated revenue of $866 million was up 4% from 1Q, '17. Cash EPS of a $1.43 was down a penny per share from last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 33.5% in 1Q, '18 down 250 basis points from 1Q, '17; about two-thirds of the reduction in margin reflects the increased security related insurance and other ongoing costs is specifically referenced in March as part of our 2018 guidance. Much of the security increases, much of the increases in security related ongoing costs are being incurred directly in business units. As we discussed in March we are expecting continued revenue impact from the cybersecurity incident in USIS and Workforce Solution in 2018 with a greater impact in the first half of 2018 and the impact of planning for other remainder of the year. This continues to be our expectation however at this point going forward wills not quantifying impact at the length of time since the incident does not allow for reasonable comparison versus premiums and expectations. USIS revenue in 1Q, 2018 was $307 million down 1% compared to the first quarter of 2017 and consistent with our expectations. Online information solutions revenue was $220 million down 2% was compared to the year ago period. Identity and fraud solutions and commercial risk online drove the majority of the decline. The decline in identity and fraud was more than explained by the decline in our government business. We saw decline in commercial risk online as we transition to CFM. We expect commercial risk online to return the growth in the second half of 2018, core online was also down about 1%. Over mortgage related revenue for USIS is up 8%. Total mortgage related revenue for Equifax including Workforce Solutions mortgage revenue was up 9%. Our mortgage revenue growth was stronger than the overall market which saw inquiries declined 3%. USIS mortgage solutions business in which we sell Tri bureau mortgage reports was benefited by the launch of three bureau trended data for mortgage. In 2Q, 2018, we expect mortgage market volumes to be down high single digits for 2Q, 2017 and for all of 2018 we continue to expect mortgage market volumes to be down about 10%. Financial and marketing services revenue was $46 million in 1Q, 2018 down slightly just under $100 million. Importantly credit marketing services revenue which represents about 80% of financial marketing services revenue was up slightly in 1Q, 2018 as it was in 4Q, '17. IXI revenue was down in the quarter over IXI revenues traditionally lumpy and the decline in 1Q '18 reflects the delay in timing of specific transactions. As Mark indicated earlier, we continue to make progress working with customers and the reduced volume in cybersecurity incident. For our discussion in March, our plans and guidance reflected diminishing impact of the event as being moved through 2018. Consistent with prior discussions today, the principle impact then our ability to sell products into certain customers impacting NPI and to sell best transactions in financial marketing services, principally credits marketing services as well as likely some impact online -- on some impact to online. This was resulted in loss sales and share as we have worked through this process. We believe that the good progress we have made today with customers will benefit our sales efforts as we look forward in 2018 and into 2019. The adjusted EBITDA margin for USIS was 44.1% down approximately 450 basis points from last year. USIS margins were principally impacted in 1Q '18 by three factors. Revenue mix particularly increased mortgage represented almost half of the impact, remainder primarily reflected increased third-party cost particularly impacting mortgage and increased security related in other technology and legal cost. Looking at 2Q, we expect USIS margins to increase substantially from 1Q '18 levels reflecting a lower mix of mortgage revenue and expense management. Workforce solutions revenue is 2011 million in the quarter of 6% when compared to 1Q 2017. The 12% growth and verification services that Mark referenced reflects double-digit growth across government panel solutions, mortgage and debt management and was slightly better than expectations. We also grew both active and total records again in 1Q '18. In Florida, service revenue of $83 million was down slightly less than 3% from last year an improvement from 4Q '17. Workforce analytics is up slightly and continues to be impacted by uncertainty regarding the status of U.S. Affordable Care Act. Unemployment claims, which makes up about half of the remainder of employer services is being impacted by the very low unemployment rate. We are also seeing some weakness across actual related services and on boarding businesses. The continued growth of the verification services and the work number and shift and mix of revenue toward verification services is positive long-term and consistent with our plan. The workforce solutions adjusted EBTIDA margin was 48.9% in 1Q '18 down a 130 basis points from 1Q '17. The decline was more than explained by the expected increase in cost related to security and technology partially offset by positive mix due to the growth in verifier. We continue to expect workforce solutions EBTIDA margins to be flat to up slightly in 2018 versus 2017. International revenue was $245 million in 1Q '18 up 13% on a reported basis and up 9% on a local currency basis. Asia Pacific revenue was $82 million up 14% U.S. dollars and up 11% in local currency driven by strong growth in our government vertical and identify commercial and consumer products. Europe's revenue was $71 million in 1Q '18 up 15% U.S. dollars and 1% in local currency. As Mark mentioned earlier, we saw high single-digit local currency growth on our combined U.K. and same credit operations. This was offset by a local currency revenue decline in our debt management business specifically in Aventure with the U.K. government. Aventure continues to deliver greater than expected value to the government. However, the U.K. government budget cycles are resulted in lower revenue in first half '18 than the prior year. We expect for the full year total debt services, local currency revenue to be about flat as U.K., as revenue with the U.K. government recovers in the second half of the year. Latin America's revenue was $56 million in 1Q '18 up 10% in U.S. dollars and up 15% in local currency. Revenue growth was broad based with strong double-digit local currency growth and our Argentina cluster as well as in Mexico and Ecuador. We also saw good growth across Chile and Central America. Canada's revenue was $36 million up 13% in U.S. dollars and up 8% in local currency. Candidates' growth was driven by online volume and analytical services and continues to reflect their strong execution. International suggested EBITDA margin was 29.4% in 1Q '18 down 180 basis points from 1Q '17. The decline reflects expected increase random technology as well as growth in data and analytics spend as we expand globally. Consumer solutions revenue, at $103 million in 1Q '18 was down 3% on a reported basis and down 4% on a local currency basis. Our U.S. consumer direct revenue declined 21% in the quarter. As we discussed in March, this reflects a reduction subscriptions as we did not advertise during 1Q '18 and will not for at least 2Q '18. U.S. consumer direct business is now just over 30% of GCS revenue. Non U.S. consumer direct revenue was up slightly reflecting continued growth in Canada offset by a decline in the U.K. Our partner in reseller business, which is approximately 40% of GCS revenue, delivered mid single-digit revenue growth following growth in 4Q '17 as well. Revenue in the quarter was benefited by the ID Watchdog acquisition completed in 3Qs. In a non-recurring cost associated with cybersecurity incident, the adjusted general corporate expense for the quarter was $65 million up $4 million from 1Q '17 reflecting expected increases and security transformation and insurance spend that we discussed with you in March. Our GAAP effective tax rate of 23.9% includes a $3 million benefit from the income tax effective stock awards. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate using calculating adjusted EPS for 1Q '18 was 26.4%. We expect our effective tax rate for 2018 to be approximately 26.5%. In 1Q '18 operating cash flow was $120 million and free cash flow was $63 million up 15% and 19% respectively. Net cash flow benefited by lower cash outflow related to variable compensation and other working capital partially offset by spend related to the cybersecurity incident including capital spending, net of the cash received from insurance recoveries. Capital spending incurred in the quarter was $56 million. For 2018, we continue to expect capital spending to be approximately 8% of revenue. Total net debt at the end of 1Q '18 was $2.38 billion. Our gross leverage was 2.43 times and net leverage was 2.2 times at the end of 1Q '18. We did not repurchase shares in 1Q '18 and do not expect Q1, Q2 '18. Now turning to our guidance for 2Q '18, at current exchange rates we expect revenue to be between $880 million and $890 million reflecting growth of 3% to 4% versus 2Q '17. FX based on current exchange rates is expected to be a 1% benefit in the quarter. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between 151 and 156 per share, this reflects the decline of 3% to 6% from 2Q '17 with no impact from FX in 2Q '18. Using the midpoint of our guidance range adjusted EPS increases approximately $0.11 per share in 2Q '18 versus 1Q '18, which is consistent with our average over the last five years. As a reminder, 2Q '17 was Equifax strongest quarter ever had adjusted EPS of a $1.60 per share and adjusted EBITDA margins of 39%. Our full year, 2018 guidance for Equifax revenue and EPS are unchanged from the March call. In total, we continue to expect Equifax revenue for the year of between $3.425 billion and $3.525 billion. This reflects revenue growth of 2% to 5%. FX based on current rates is expected to be a 1% benefit to revenue in 2018. Consistent with our March guidance, this assumes total mortgage market volumes decline about 10% in 2018. We expected adjusted EPS to be between 580 and $6 per share unchanged from our March guidance. FX is expected to be up 2% per share benefit to EPS in 2018. We continued to expect in 2018 to incur approximately $200 million of net incremental cost for investments and IT in data security projects and legal and professional fees being incurred specifically to address the litigation claims in governmental and regulatory investigations related to the cybersecurity incident. This represents gross cost of $275 million offset by $75 million of assumed insurance proceeds. Investments in IT and data security are expected to represent about 75% of the cost. These costs are being excluded from our non-GAAP financial results and guidance. In 2Q '18, we expect these costs to be at or slightly less than what was incurred in 1Q '18. These estimates do not include any estimates or damages, fines or other announcements that result from the resolution of litigation and investigations relates to the cybersecurity incident. Looking at the first half of 2018 using the midpoint of our 2Q '18 guidance, revenue was $1.75 billion and adjusted EPS of about 297 per share provides a very strong start to 2017 relative to our full year guidance. And with that, we will open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead. Manav Patnaik : Thank you and welcome to the call, Mark. My first question, Mark, just in your initial assessment, I know you've talked about the commitment to security and infrastructure and there's clearly been a lot of spend in that area. I guess, how would you describe where you are in that process, early mid stages or how long do you think this continues? Mark Begor : Yes, Manav, good morning, and thanks for your comments. I'm only two weeks in so it's hard for me to give a detailed assessment. I'll ask John, maybe to weigh in also. But my look is that there's a lot of work that's been done in the last six seven months by the team, so we're making good progress. But I would also say it's still early days, there's still a lot of work to do. As you know, our new system has only been on the ground for less than 60 days, he is a really strong talent, he's bringing some new people in and I guess, in summary I would just, say early days. John, anything to add to that? We've got a lot of work to do in the rest of this year? John Gamble : Absolutely. And we've indicated that the spend of the MD activities will run at least through 2019 and obviously as we move through 2018, as we have greater visibility, we'll update people on how we're doing. Mark Begor : But just maybe to close on that, I hope you feel and others on the phone feel our commitment to this. This is a very large effort by the team, it's a massive undertaking and it's one that we're extremely serious about and we're committed to industry leadership around data security and it will go through for sure for the rest of this year. Manav Patnaik : Got it. And then John, I think you went through it a little quickly, but just on the global consumer breakout, I think that was the area where it felt like you beat the expectations the most, but -- so I think you said that direct, which was a little over 30% of the mix was down 21%, and then did you say that the rest of the piece was up slightly and then I think in there you threw in something was up middle single digits as well. Can you just help me with that and what -- how much ID watchdog contributed to that? John Gamble : Sure. So we said our partner and reseller, which is about 40% as ECS revenue, we said it was up mid single-digits. And our non-consumer direct revenue was up slightly. And that's really Canada and the U.K. and that was Canada growing and the U.K. declining and then ID watchdog contributed just under $5 million. Manav Patnaik : Okay. All right. Thanks, guys. Operator : We'll take our next question from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Rayna Kumar : Good morning, this is Rayna Kumar for David Togut. In terms of some of the government contracts that were delayed in previous quarters, can you just flush out how some of those conversations are going and if you can just provide us some milestones we can track so we can get a better idea of how your progress is with those contracts. John Gamble : Yes, so I think we haven't actually spoken specifically about government contracts, but we've indicated rather that in general we continue to work with customers and that there have been some deferrals of agreements where we execute in our CMS business and our financial marketing services business. But as we talked about last quarter we said anything that's really been deferred since the cyber security incident which was in September we would assume as lost. And then going forward what we're doing is just working on winning new agreements with new customers. And as Mark walked you through, we think we're making very good progress there in moving our customers to the point of considering new transactions with us and new products with us. So what we provided was some discussion around the impacts of the cyber security incident last year. But I don't think we specifically talked about government. Rayna Kumar : Got it. One of your competitors is starting to sell trended data outside of mortgage and into the auto and credit card verticals; can you just discuss your plans with trended data? John Gamble : Sure. Absolutely. So we consider trended data to be a critical part of our NPI process. We're seeing trended data growing in our business as well. We do think there's applications in auto, we do think there's applications in credit card, and trended data, quite honestly, is something we'll also start to apply around the world. So we would expect that we will see growth from those areas as we move through the future as well. Rayna Kumar : Okay. And one final question\u2026 John Gamble : And we did just launch a commercial trended score this quarter. Rayna Kumar : That's very helpful. One final question from me, when do you expect to restart share buyback? John Gamble : Yes, so we talked a little bit about this last quarter, right, so until we have clarity around the outcome of the consumer and other litigation and class action litigation, we'll likely not be executing share repurchases until we have a good understanding of what that liability may look like. Q - Rayna Kuma : Thank you. Operator : All right. We'll move to our next question, will come from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Andrew Steinerman : Welcome, Mark. John, you just mentioned that the IT spend will run at least, \"At least through 2019,\" and then the last quarter the description was heavy lifting in IT spend and data security in 2018 and 2019, so my question is does Equifax have a full sense of what the total spend will be to IT and data security to build an industry leading system? Mark Begor : I'll take the first crack at that and John should jump in with more color probably, but Andrew, great to connect with you here for the first time. The answer is no. We don't have that full visibility yet, we're working very hard to do that. The team has -- I would characterize is a pretty good visibility for what we're planning to do in 2018 and I think in the last quarter, John, we talked about that and decided that for you. We haven't really gone beyond '18 yet, but my expectation is that there will be work that will go beyond '18 to complete our data security and infrastructure rebuild and as we get into the second half of the year, I would hope we can give you some visibility around that. Andrew Steinerman : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll move next to George Mihalos with Cowen. Please go ahead. George Mihalos : Good morning guys, and Mark, welcome aboard. Mark Begor : Thanks, George. George Mihalos : Just wanted to go back to one of your comments in your script around -- it sounds like the tenor of conversations with customers is improving. Are you seeing more inquiries though from non-traditional customers as well, basically people that have not been using Equifax in the past that are willing to have conversations around potentially buying some services? Mark Begor : That's when I got lost. John, maybe can give you a little color on it. I'd give you some color on the customer meetings that I've been in is that customers want to understand deeply our investments and our pace around our data security upgrades. And as you know we've got a myriad of communication processes with the [indiscernible] customers, individual meetings with senior executives of our customers. So I would characterize the dialog that they appreciate the transparency, they expect the transparency. I think they're pleased with the scale of our investment and our commitment to it, how serious we're taking it and the comments that we've made about industry leadership around data security. At the same time, my meetings with customers is that they also want to get back to the normal dialogs that we had pre the incident around growth, around new products, around NPI, so my interactions have been with existing customers, I don't know, John any color about beyond that? John Gamble : Sure. Some of the new products we talked about last year a little bit like for example, InstaTouch, is starting to attract interaction for us with different parts of our existing customers as well as potentially with new customers. Also we've increased our activity in terms of pursuing fintech in the fintech markets. Some of it because of the new products we have offered and has been also further reasons. So we think that's an expansion of the focus that we have had probably over the past six to eight months. George Mihalos : Okay, that's helpful. And then John, just as a quick follow-up, the Q2 guide on the revenue side suggests -- call it 3% revenue growth down a little bit from the 4% in the first quarter. Anything that particularly will be slowing down or is it just sort of the tougher comp in USIS that's impacting the number? John Gamble : Generally, what should be occurring as you go up -- we're going to see GCS performance weaken, so that will be the thing that probably drives the impact more than anything else if we move through the rest of the year. We would expect you'll see the decline in consumer lightly accelerate. George Mihalos : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Brett Huff with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead. Brett Huff : Good morning guys and Mark welcome to the call. Mark Begor : Thanks, Brett. Brett Huff : Two quick questions, one sort of a big picture one, we've kind of talked around it. But on GCS or the direct to consumer business, we've gotten a lot of questions on the fate of that. I know Mark, you're in the middle of that decision strategically, but could you just outline sort of the puts and takes or the main issues that you all are weighing as you consider that and then I have one follow-up. Mark Begor : Yes, I'll start on that one and ask John to jump in too. For me it's early days on that. I've only been here for a little better than a week and a half and had some dialogs around it. Really what I want to take a hard look at is what are the opportunities? There's going to be real balance in the consumer space around a lot of the activities that we're going to deliver to consumers for free and that's something we're committed to and we're committed to giving consumers more control in access around their data and really looking at what are some of the paid services that we may offer in the future and value-added nature. So that's really the kind of calculus for me. I think I mentioned my background is kind of B2C from the synchrony updates and I got a real appreciation for both the protection of consumer data as well as a kind of value-added services you could add, you can deliver to consumers but it's going to take the better part of the second and the third quarter, I would think for us to come as a conclusions about a strategy there that we feel good about. We are going to be thoughtful about it and we will share that when we complete that analysis. John Gamble : And as Mark covered, we are also relooking at to state basically the consumer direct market broadly because that market has been changing as we know over the past several years and how much of that market we believe is continue, going to be delivered direct or through resellers and through the premium models somewhat as Mark, referenced. So we look at the market in general to see what we think has happened, we did that a couple of years ago, we are doing that again now, and then, also obviously specifically whether or not we think we have anything differentiate that would let us participate well, if we think that market is still going to, is still going to be a growing opportunity. So, still more work to do. Brett Huff : Thanks. It's helpful. And then, the second question is on the NPI, I know this is one of the key hallmarks of Equifax and something you guys continue do really well, part of your culture. But my understanding was, there was some shift in talent from some of the NPI, sort of projects to the cybersecurity incident issues, am I understanding that right and if so how do we think about the ongoing allocation of resources to NPI, how much talent will that -- will the cyber issues kind of heat up for long you know, that sort of negatively impact NPI in the near term? Mark Begor : Yes, it's a great question. This one is on my mind just a short time I've been here. First is I think you properly point out NPI has been a real strength of Equifax as it's you want to think that many things that attracted to be the business there. They rigor their processes around partnering with customers around bringing new products to market and we got a long history of doing that and as you also pointed out there we have had and would some resources on the technology side and other areas working on the data security breach and infrastructure we built, but we are working hard, so we fill those resources on the NPI side. So we expect there will be some pressure there. My goal is to work hard to mitigate that with the addition of resources and focus around NPI because it's important to us and important to our customers going forward. I think it's probably hard to articulate any kind of metrics around that plus there the first quarter was encouraging on the NPIs that we did bring to market versus our expectation. So even six plus months into - since the incident, we are bringing products to market but it will be real focus of ours to continue to resource that and make sure that momentum continues. Brett Huff : Great. Thank you. John Gamble : Thank you Mark and very confirmation progress with customer. So, one of the re-launching products, and then, obviously one of the impact as well as how rapidly we are able to turn them to revenue and so it's very important that we improve the engagement with customer as we are, so that we can get back to a more normal type with customer acceptance with the new products even after their launch. So, certainly an impact on NPI this year for those two reasons. Brett Huff : Great. I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question will come from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Andrew Jeffrey : Hi, good morning guys. I appreciate, you taking the call. Look forward to working with Mark. Mark Begor : Welcome. Andrew Jeffrey : Have you think about this re-platform and obviously there are a lot of costs in management focus headed to it. But as you get past the technology investment and the security investment, have you started to think about how the new platform and the new delivery motion could benefit the long-term growth and competitive positioning of Equifax's business? Mark Begor : Yes, I think it's a great question. Just wondered on my mind being nine days in here at Equifax and just wondered we are the heat of it obviously ramping up some projects around data security of our infrastructure rebuild. Some of the dialogue I had with the team of goals I'd like to get on the other side of this investment is speed of market with the investments we are making will allow us to bring products to market or quickly an ability to have higher dependability and liability of our infrastructure on the other side. So my goal is that after the market I hope it will improve our cost structure as we make some of these investments and first and foremost we are going to have a data infrastructure and a data security infrastructure that will be industry leading and that should position us well competitively going forward. Andrew Jeffrey : Okay, and will you anticipate to the extent that our benefits associated with have been talking about this time next year, is that a reasonable expectation? Mark Begor : At this time, next year I think having some visibility on our side in years around that, I think it's very, very simple and that's a great goal. Andrew Jeffrey : Okay, and as a follow-up, with regard to the U.K. and TDX in particular John it sounds like some of the demand softness is transitory. Can you just fresh that out a little bit and how you think that impacts specifically the European sub segment revenue growth this year? John Gamble : Yes, those we said the credit business performed very well, right with high single-digit local currency growth. So the impact really was specific to debt, with the debt service the business is very specific really mostly around the one large contract with the U.K. government. The contract itself is performing very well, we think we are collecting at rates that are above the expectations we are improving collections at rates that are above the expectations of our customer, which we think is very good. However, the funding of the project is part of the U.K. government budget cycle and we are working through that right now. Obviously, that's something that's a little bit new to us, in terms of working through the U.K. government budget cycle, but it's specific to that cycle that has resulted in a lower level of activity in the first half of this year. So we are hopeful that we will be able to work through that and as I said to move back type of performance throughout the year but it isn't a issue of the performance of the product of Aventure is performing well, it's really just very specific to the U.K. government budget cycle. Andrew Jeffrey : Okay, helpful. Thanks. Operator : Our next question will come from Tim McHugh with William Blair. Please go ahead. Tim McHugh : Thanks. Mark maybe first one, it was helpful, you've given us a lot of contacts and I understand at early days in terms of your time there but to get to the high level a lot, what you describe I guess there are some other things I thought we are kind of in motion. Are there things that you would call out as you walk in at this point that you want differently you are emphasizing I guess maybe more than, we otherwise thought the kind of the plan was partially getting in it, just kind of understanding your perspective. Mark Begor : Yes, I think first I'll start with - I think the team has been, has got a great plan in place and when I think about areas of interest for me nine days in is it's around the patent accountability about around all our projects, as you might imagine there is a lot of work being done here and I'm a big ownership accountability follow-up kind of leaders. So the team had prophecy to place around that, I will just say that I'm going to try to strengthen those and make sure that we are really executing on these projects on a timely basis. Second, would be around this team was operating quickly. I'm a leader that that's the high bar and also my team and that place is really around let's get these projects done and get on with the next one. Third, would be around people, we are adding a bunch of resources here and I want to make sure we are adding top talent in the organization and retaining the talent that we have, so that's an important initiative and the last one is really around customers and transparency. I try to be clear about that and I think the team in the last few months was contributing towards a lot more open in transparent conversations with our customers and that's kind of a table six for me is being really clear with our customers having really strong relationships in connections with them and those four items I rather go off really aren't different probably from what they were doing but you can take from me perhaps some emphasis and really focus on those areas as being important and how I want to lead the business. Tim McHugh : That's helpful. And John, one question, just numbers when the rest from five year old reports now being fully trended, I guess I believe that does that kick in I guess throughout the full year? Is that a type of a fact that we should see during the next couple of quarters? John Gamble : We should yes, but that was I think the bulk of the quarter that occurred this quarter. So you will see it in any quarter going forward. Obviously mortgage tends to be a relatively high percentage of revenue earlier in the year in the first quarter and some of the second quarter investment does tend to tail-off but actually see that live throughout the year. Tim McHugh : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Allison Chou : Hi, this is Allison Chou on for George. Thanks for taking my question. The International segment revenue grew 13% in 1Q has strengthened in couple of key regions, can you discuss how the operating environment for the International business is evolving and your outlook there as well as internal initiatives you have in place to sustain that growth? John Gamble : Yes, so international actually performed very nice other than that management which we talked about international performed very nicely, the growth rate we talked about across Latin America, U.K., Canada, Australia, were all very good. We're fortunate that it looks like the economy is really in all of our major countries are going to perform we think relatively well this year and so we feel very good about that. Some of the major focus areas for them are really continuing to be around NPI, Mark already covered it right NPI is the growth engine of the company, International has long been a very strong performer in NPI, they tend to perform frequently above our goal of vitality index of 10% and the deployment of Cambrian and then our decisioning systems international in international is really accelerating and our expectation is that will allow them to deliver new products faster and develop new products faster. Also what Mark talked about in terms of delivering machine learning through Cambrian and now most of our major international markets we think is something that is going to be very beneficial as we go forward. So we're excited about it and the trend across those businesses really in the credit business has been very strong. Allison Chou : Thanks, that's really helpful. And on NPI and kind of as a follow-up to Brett, you guys launched 17 new products in 2017 which is up about 30% year-over-year. Can you discuss how the ongoing personnel changes or kind of headcount shifts will impact the number of new product launches this year and NPI contribution or revenue growth? John Gamble : Just fraction and we launched kind of mid-50s in terms of new products in 2017 that is correct. Mark Begor : I think I mentioned in what is the prior question on NPI is there is no question, we've got some resource constraints versus pretty incident in all areas of business including NPI and as I said earlier we're working hard to backfill those resources that have been diverted over to work on the data security infrastructure rebuild and IT infrastructure rebuild. So I would say we expect to see some pressure, we want to work hard to try to mitigate that pressures we go through the year and it's it is only the first quarter and I think we said earlier the first quarter was a good start versus last year when it comes to NPI rollouts and we want to say on that important growth quarter for us. Allison Chou : Great, thank you. Operator : We will move next to Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Bill Warmington : Good morning everyone. Mark Begor : Hey, Bill. Bill Warmington : So Mark, first of all welcome to you, I have to confess it, it's a bit of mixed feelings though because I think it's a nice hire for Equifax but we're losing you on the board in FICO, so that's kind of the offset. But you're welcome. Mark Begor : I missed Will and his team have a great business and I enjoyed my three years on the board. Bill Warmington : So a couple of questions for you, the first is and talking about the return of the project based business on the marketing side, I wanted to ask how are the reviews by clients going, are most of those now completed or they still there are some that are ongoing when you think, you can expect them to be completed and so you'll be fully greenlighted for new business? John Gamble : Bill, I think it's really what Mark covered in his opening comments, right. We continue to make very good progress, the discussions are ongoing, we haven't really set an end date right and quite honestly probably continue as we through much of the year as we continue to make progress with customers. This is an evolving process but as Mark indicated, very good progress and moving conversations back towards normal, backward consideration of new products and backward consideration of the type of CMS jobs that have been impacted certainly last year and through this quarter to a degree. So we think very good progress but in terms of setting an end date I don't think that's something we can do. Mark Begor : I will give you a live example from a meeting over there, a week ago Bill with one of our big customers, we spent the first 30 minutes or so giving an update on all the actions we're taking around the data security incidents, the investments and technology and in data security and the CEO of the business we were kind of halfway through our presentation and he said great dialogue let's spend the rest of the time talking about what we're going to do about partnering together help us grow. So I think that an example of that, we're going to be in this dialogue with them for as long as I can see meaning the what the next three quarters or may be longer of reporting out how we're doing but customers are counting on us making those investments, they're counting on it making the data and infrastructure security improvements. They are serious in our progress and they want to get back to talking about business and growth in our NPIs and how we can help them grow. Bill Warmington : And then my follow-up question for you is on the IT and security system side. It sounds like part of what has the preacher has done is given you an opportunity to really shut down a number of older versions of products and move clients to the latest base SaaS delivery as well and that sounds like a win-win in terms of getting the no more secure system and then also for you guys simpler and less expensive to support going forward. I wanted to ask how are those transitions going with clients have you found them receptive to it? Mark Begor : I think their first off you hit the nail in the head. I think you laid out what we're trying to do and the opportunity for us in the benefit to come to ask our customers and the other side of this transformation and it's still early days, we're I would say the first John correct if I'm wrong but the first six months or so since the incident, most of our work was around our data security efforts and I would say in the last couple months we started to move towards lot of the infrastructure improvements that you described they have a data security elements to it but they're also going to bring a lot of simplicity; a lot of cost, hopefully improvements to us and also. Allow us to be faster the market with products because we've got a simpler infrastructure and how we interact with our customers. John Gamble : And some of the transactions on the sizzling system our acceleration of the things that have been occurring so we been moving customers to SaaS system for some time this is just going to make they go much quicker. Bill Warmington : Got it. All right, well thank you very much for the insight. Mark Begor : Thanks, Bill. Operator : We will take our next question from Jeffrey Meulerw with Baird. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, good morning guys. This is [indiscernible] on for Jeff. Just look at the margins outside of the GC as some of the other excitements I guess for little surprising to ask in the quarter. Despite stripping out the onetime cost you've outlined since trying to think about that John you mentioned the make shift to mortgage but is there anything else you guys can talk about what your ramping non onetime costs that may be impacting Q1 and then how that should sequence throughout the rest of 2018? Mark Begor : Yes, so I think that in the bridges that we try to provide in the script, right, we did talk and I think in each of the businesses other than GCS really in and it present there as well about security and for information cost, we in the fourth quarter we have given some very specific discussion around cost we expected to incur in 2018 related to security and IT investments as well as related to as related to insurers costs and we think we're seeing those, they're impacting our those are certainly impacting that the margins we saw on the first quarter and will likely impact throughout the year is consistent with the guidance we gave in March. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, just specific to GCS given that you guys are marketing Q2 would you expect to similar kind of year-over -year margin in Q2 was relative to 2017? Mark Begor : We didn't really provide guidance on margins but please do remember right we're going to see continue acceleration and decline of the Consumer Direct business, so the marketing spend is out was out in the prior quarters and you can see an acceleration in the decline of it consumer direct business. So that certainly has an effect on margin. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. Operator : Our next question will come from David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. David Ridley-Lane: Sure. Appreciate the details on revenue related to the U.S. direct-to-consumer business when you're making that decision on the business later this year with the direct consumer direct-to-consumer business still be profitable at that point just to help shareholders understand the potential impact? Mark Begor : Obviously that the outcome of the decision, right, on how we are going to move forward will take into account the level of profitability we can deliver. So, at this point in time I don't think I can really address that specifically, but we will wait and see, we'll give you updates on how we are performing at USIS as we move through the year, and as we get to the point of making that decision obviously the level of profitability we think we can drive going forward will be an important consideration. David Ridley-Lane: Understood. And just how is the NPI-related revenue contribution in first quarter of this year versus last year? Mark Begor : Yes. So we don't generally give very specifics around NPI revenue by quarter. We tend to give it by year. And I think the update we gave today was simply to give people some perspective on the number of products that were launched in the quarter, so that we are seeing -- we are continuing to see momentum in product launches, but we had indicated pretty specifically that we would expect to see NPI revenue impacted in the year because of the customer impacts that we talked about a few times today. David Ridley-Lane: Understood, thank you very much. Operator : We will take our final question from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Toni Kaplan : Hi. Welcome, Mark. Mark Begor : Hi, Toni. Toni Kaplan : I know this has been asked in a couple of ways and even on the last question, but I think it could be helpful in understanding, you know, there is a pretty start difference between your growth in USIS and that of one of your primary competitors and you mentioned the government deferrals, but is there some sort of way to quantify some of the impacts on the commercial side? So just directionally like, how much is sort of this lower growth coming from like lower upselling or versus delayed spending of customer, just directionally, or if you just want to quantify in some other way I think that would just be very helpful. Thank you. Mark Begor : Yes, I think the level of detail we provided is what we can give right now, Toni. I mean, we specifically indicated that we're going to be trying to quantify dollar impact from the cybersecurity incident going forward, just because it's been so long since the event occurred that really isn't a reasonable comparison point. So at this point I think going forward we will talk about the revenue we generate and how it's moving forward, but I don't think we can provide more detail than we did in the script. John Gamble : I think we said in the call a couple of times, there is no question that the USIS team is seeing some pressure, and has seen some pressure from customers. It's really around the delay of new product work while they get comfortable around our cybersecurity and data infrastructure or rebuilt. And I characterized it a couple of times you know, it feels like those conversations are moving back towards more normal discussions as they get more comfortable with the seriousness that we are invested -- and large investments we are making in our infrastructure. So, that's kind of the color that we have so far, and the team is working hard as you might imagine, to get those NPIs and other product rollouts in front of customers. Toni Kaplan : Okay. And I'm sure the answer is no, but I guess there is no way to sort of give us a color on how many customers have just actually gone somewhere else versus continuing conversations with you? Mark Begor : I think the detail we have given today is what we can provide. Toni Kaplan : Thank you. Okay. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Trevor Burns for any additional or closing remarks. Trevor Burns : I just want to thank everybody for joining the call. I appreciate your time. Have a good day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Operator : Good day and welcome to the Equifax second quarter 2018 earnings call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Trevor Burns. Please go ahead. Trevor Burns - Equifax, Inc.: Thanks and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Trevor Burns, Investor Relations. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Dodge, Investor Relations. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com. During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including third quarter and full year guidance to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risk factors, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2017 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. Also we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance. For the second quarter of 2018, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes, among other things, acquisition-related amortization expense, the income tax effects of stock awards recognized upon vesting or settlement and adjustments for uncertain tax positions. Adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax also excludes legal and professional fees related to cybersecurity incidents, principally fees related to our outstanding litigation and government investigations as well as the incremental non-recurring project cost designed to enhance IT and data security. This includes projects to implement systems and processes to enhance our IT and data security infrastructure, as well as projects to replace and substantially consolidate our global networks and systems, as well as the cost to manage these projects. These projects will transform our IT infrastructure and further enhance our IT and data security are available \u2013 are expected to occur throughout 2018 and 2019. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to Equifax adding back interest expense, net of interest income, depreciation and amortization, income tax expense, and also as is the case for adjusted EPS, excluding certain one-time items, including cost related to the cybersecurity incident. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release, and are also posted on our website. In the Form 10-Q to be filed later today, we will disclose the future losses from litigation and regulatory investigations are reasonably possible, but not yet estimable at this early stage in the proceedings. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark. Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: Thanks, Trevor, good morning. Looking at second quarter performance, overall revenue and adjusted EPS results were consistent with our expectations and a solid performance as we continue win back customers' trust following the 2017 security breach. Revenue of $877 million was up 2% on a reported basis and local currency basis and was toward the midpoint of the expectations we discussed with you in April. As a reminder, back in April, we expected an FX benefit in revenue growth of around 1% and as you know that did not occur in the second quarter with some of the currency fluctuations which negatively impacted our reported growth for the quarter. John will discuss this in further detail later in the call. Adjusted EPS was $1.56 and at the high end of our expectations. By business unit, Workforce Solutions and International performed very well in the quarter on a local currency basis and GCS was consistent with our expectations. USIS revenue was modestly below our expectations. However, they continue to make very good progress with customers further increasing the number of relationships where we are now able to pursue new revenue opportunities and I'll talk more about that. We also made very good progress on the critical areas of our transformation including IT and data security and customer support which we'll also cover this morning. I'll start by looking at the BUs and start with the USIS. USIS revenue was down 2% versus last year and was below the 1% decline we saw in the first quarter and slightly below our expectations. This was principally in Financial Marketing Services and to a lesser extent in Online Information Solutions. As we have discussed consistently over the past nine months, the critical strategic deliverable for USIS in 2018 is working with customers to complete their security views and most importantly win back their trust so that we can return to working back collaboratively to pursue expanded or new solutions that drive the customers' business forward and create revenue opportunities for Equifax. Starting in the first quarter but accelerating into the second quarter, we made great progress in winning back this trust. We closely track the status of our largest 80 customers and with the substantial majority I mean, that a substantial majority, we are now able to pursue expanded or new solution opportunities with those customers. Or said differently, we are rapidly approaching a mode of being back to normal commercial discussions with the vast majority of our USIS customers. Over the second quarter I met personally with a significant number of our customers across all the business units with a particular focus in USIS. As recently as last Friday, I met with two key customers up in North Carolina and I was back in North Carolina yesterday with another key customer. And consistently these customers recognize the value of Equifax, its differentiated data assets, the strength of our analytical capabilities driven by Cambrian, Ignite Direct and Marketplace. Customers are ready to work with us to solve their business needs and with very few exceptions our relationship has returned to a more normal commercial discussion or commercial relationship, focused on how we can help them grow. Every week is a positive step forward for USIS to return to a more normal mode of operations. As we discussed in the past, sales cycles in our business can be extended and are initially less predictable particularly following an unprecedented incident like the 2017 data security breach. Sales cycles historically could be as short as a few months for CMS offline transactions to as much as 9 to 12 months for online products, including customer integration both on their side and ours. In the second quarter in Financial Marketing Services, we saw this impact on the sales cycle as the bulk of the decline in Financial Marketing Services was due to a handful of transactions we expected to close in June that pushed out to the second quarter. We do not believe these transactions are lost and still expect to close the transactions and have closed several of them already in the first few weeks of July. Importantly, we are seeing the USIS sales pipeline strengthen substantially both in Online and Financial Marketing Services. Given this strength we expect USIS revenue growth in the third quarter and second half of 2018. As in the second quarter, I will continue to devote a significant amount of my time with Paulino and his team working with USIS customers as we return USIS to a more normal mode of commercial activity. We are intensely focused on this. We are intensely focused on returning USIS back to a more normal growth mode and it will continue to be a priority for me. Turning to Workforce Solutions, the team in workforce had a very solid quarter with revenue up 7%, and importantly, Verification Services had a very strong quarter with revenue up 15%. Verifier revenue growth was broad-based with double-digit growth across government, talent solutions, healthcare and auto. The Work Number record growth was also strong which as you know is critically important. We had the largest sequential growth in active and total records since the second quarter of 2017. So great progress there by the workforce team. And as you know, our growth in The Work Number makes our data increasingly valuable to our customers. As we expected, Employer Services declined in the quarter, principally in unemployment claims and our ATA-related businesses, workforce and analytics from the stronger U.S. economy and lower employment. However, as we look to the second half, we believe Employer Services overall will see growth as unemployment claims stabilize and we see growth principally in our Employer Services businesses. With continued strong growth in Verification Services and return to growth for Employer Services we expect Workforce Solutions revenue to accelerate nicely in the second half. Workforce Solutions continues to be an important strategic asset and growth engine for Equifax. International also had another very good quarter with 8% reported in local currency revenue growth. Our Latin American and Asia Pacific businesses, as well as our European credit businesses all grew over 10% in local currency. Canada had a very strong quarter growing 8% in local currency. As we discussed last quarter, our European debt management business is experiencing declines specifically in our venture with the UK government. As we indicated last quarter, the venture continues to deliver greater than expected value to the UK government, however, the UK government budget constraints have resulted in lower revenue in the first half than the prior year. We expect to see improved performance in the UK debt management business overall in the third quarter and return to growth in the fourth quarter of the year. During the quarter I spent a lot of time outside the U.S. in Australia, Canada, UK, and Spain with our management teams. I'm very excited about the future of our International businesses. In Australia, we've seen a continuous success of our business since our acquisition of Veda. Recently the largest banks in Australia announced that by the end of the third quarter of this year, they will supply the credit bureaus with at least half of the comprehensive credit reporting data they hold, paving the way for integration of positive data in the credit file and better consumer lending decisions. We expect continued performance from Australia, as well as our International team in the future. Last, turning to Global Consumer Solutions, revenue declined as expected 5% in local currency in the second quarter. To provide some perspective, our total U.S., Canada and UK consumer direct businesses represent just under half of our GCS revenue. The U.S. is the bulk of this revenue and as expected and as a result of the suspension of consumer advertising following last year's data security breach, the U.S. consumer direct business revenue declines over 25% in the second quarter of 2018, and now represents just over 30% of total GCS revenue. Our partner business is now the majority of our GCS revenue and represents direct to customer partners principally Credit Karma and LifeLock, as well as our growing U.S. benefits channel business. Our partner business revenue is predominantly in U.S. and is a very important franchise for Equifax in our GCS business. Our partner business was up nicely in the second quarter both in direct to consumer and in benefits. This growth partially offset the large declines in our direct to consumer business, as we again did not advertise in the second quarter. In terms of the future of our U.S. consumer direct business, and we talked about this before with you. We believe maintaining a broader direct relationship with consumers will be important to our commitment to substantially strengthen our consumer support in the U.S., as well as to our direct-to-consumer partner NPI efforts. We intend to continue to invest in our U.S. consumer direct businesses, and in the U.S. \u2013 in the U.S. and in UK, Canada and Australia. We expect to begin marketing in U.S. again before year-end, likely in the fourth quarter, and it's likely our level of marketing investment will be consistent with that which we had in 2016 and the second half of 2017. Turning to our commitment to becoming an industry leader in technology and data security and consumer support, this is fundamental to Equifax and we've talked a lot about the significant investments that we're making in this area. We made very good progress in the second quarter on all those initiatives. We will deliver on these commitments through our IT and process transformation, but also critically through ensuring we have a culture that puts security and customer support first. Our enhanced government structure, with a new risk office and a leader responsible for strengthening our enterprise risk management is designed to fully support this commitment. This structure, utilizing three clear lines of defense is effective for our customers and was for me in my prior role leading Synchrony Financial and it will help us ensure the culture we're committed to will endure. During the second quarter, we also made very good progress in building out the senior leadership team. You saw the announcement a few weeks ago with the addition of our new CTO Bryson Koehler. Bryson brings very deep IT, Cloud, and transformation experience from leading IBM's Watson and Cloud efforts and prior to that, the CTO of The Weather Channel. His deep product and cloud expertise, including experience in consolidating premise-based systems and transitioning them to both public and consistently private cloud environments is directly applicable to the IT transformation we have underway. Bryson joins our CISO Jamil Farshchi, who joined us in the first quarter, and Prasanna Dhor\u00e9, head of our Data and Analytics team to really round out a very strong IT, security, and data and analytics team that will really drive our initiatives going forward. Jamil has already substantially strengthened our security team, bringing in leaders with strong technical backgrounds, as well as security experience. And I know Bryson is quickly off doing the same thing to really build out and strengthen our technology team. I want to thank personally Mark Rohrwasser for his strong leadership as interim CTO (sic) [CIO] (00:13:57) over the past nine months. Mark did an outstanding job and I'm really pleased that Mark will remain with Equifax as the CTO (sic) [CIO] (00:14:04) of our International business unit. You also saw the announcement last Friday of Paulino Barros stepping back in to lead our USIS business unit. You know Paulino well from his prior leadership roles at Equifax. He's been responsible for every corner of Equifax over many, many years. He's well-known internally and well-liked by our customers and the team across Equifax. Paulino is an outstanding operating executive and his depth of experience and focus on results, laser focus on results, will be a boost to us in USIS and across Equifax and will ensure that we do not miss a beat as our U.S. business continues its path to recovery and return to a growth mode. I expect Paulino to dial up the intensity and focus with the USIS team on driving growth and I plan to partner with him closely in the second half. We have the right team in place for growth at Equifax. Our technology transformation is critical to our technology and data security and customer support commitments. And when fully implemented, fundamental to delivering revenue acceleration, speed to market and margin enhancements across Equifax. We're making very strong progress in accelerating our technology transformation as our technology DNA and security teams are executing on a transition to a standard global data-centric infrastructure, enhancing and extending our leading Cambrian, Ignite and Global Gateway and decisioning platforms with a cloud-first strategy. As we accelerate progress, we now expect total gross non-recurring spending related to the cybersecurity incident in 2017, principally non-recurring project cost related to our IT transformation and security plan, which we've talked about many times with you previously, as well as legal and other professional fee to be approximately $300 million, up about $25 million from levels that we discussed in April. And we view this positively as we continue to invest in our business. As we discussed last quarter, our new product innovation and continued investments in the expansion of Cambrian and our Ignite analytics and linking platforms globally remains a top priority for our entire team. Both are off to a great start in 2018, despite being impacted as we focus project management and technology resources on IT and data security. As we talked on the last call in April, we're focused on making sure we keep resources focused on our NPI initiatives. We worked diligently to keep those resources protected and we have an active pipeline of over 100 new products at various stages in the funnel and we're tracking to launch over 50 products this year, consistent with our track record of launching new products in 2017, and 2016. As with all years, success in delivering NPI revenue in 2018 and 2019 will be heavily based on sales of products launched in 2017 and 2016. As we move through 2018, we're seeing a growing number of successes. Ignite Direct and Marketplace placements, along with the pipeline of new products are growing very nicely with both delivering revenue and enabling faster NPI with customers that adopt the platform. Our new Identity and Fraud products based on machine learning are gaining traction in the Card space. Yesterday, we talked \u2013 when I was with my \u2013 our customer in North Carolina, we talked at length about our new Identity and Fraud products. In Commercial, trended data and trended database scores are also gaining traction and InstaTouch, which we launched in 2017, is also expanding adoption and was part of my discussion with one of our key customers yesterday. A second major card provider has now signed to implement InstaTouch and we've signed several other agreements during the quarter and the pipeline is very active. M&A also remains an active avenue for growth for Equifax. We are building our pipeline and have completed several bolt-on acquisitions supporting Workforce Solutions in Latin America in the first half of 2018. You saw 10 days ago that we announced the acquisition of DataX, a leading U.S.-based specialty finance credit reporting agency and alternative data provider to lenders nationwide. DataX will become a part of USIS and their data assets will complement our core credit, telco and utilities exchange and The Work Number databases to further broaden the base of consumers for which Equifax can assist lenders in making credit decisions. This includes lenders in the installment loan, rent to own, lease to own markets. Additional DataX offerings included credit reporting, ID verification, bank account verification, and customer risk services are a part of those offerings. We are very excited about this new data set for our U.S. customers. Stepping back, I have been with Equifax for just over 100 days. And as I mentioned earlier, I've spent over half of my time on the road, meeting with customers, partners, and also regulators to as rapidly as possible gain their perspectives on Equifax, while focusing on regaining their trust and confidence in us. As I mentioned, I was with a big customer in North Carolina yesterday and two customers last Friday. I'm spending better part of half of my time with customers with a big focus on our U.S. USIS customers. Their insights are incredibly valuable and overall very consistent. We have great support from our customers. They value Equifax's differentiated data assets. They are very supportive of our strong progress on security and technology, but they are also clear that we must execute on that data and security plan. Given the events of 2017, the bar is higher for us, and we must deliver on our commitments to be a leader in these areas and we will. Our customers and partners have also been clear that Equifax data is unique, and our analytical capabilities are very strong and differentiated. However, competition is very aggressive, and to win our focus on the customer needs to be sharper. This will be a personal focus of mine, and the entire Equifax team going forward. Resources, both people and investment, are and will move closer to customers. New product generation jointly with customers in a collaborative way through our DNA and NPI teams and commercial teams will be accelerated. This includes making access to Cambrian, Ignite and our data scientist easier, faster and more co-collaborative with our customers. Finally, our technology transformation will be prioritized to deliver speed of new products to customers. We are committed to returning USIS to competitive levels of growth and accelerating the growth of Workforce Solutions International. I also want to ensure consumers and customers have my absolute commitment and my personal priority to making Equifax a leader in IT and data security and customer support, to ensure that we protect the sensitive consumer and customer data which we've been entrusted and to empower individuals to understand and manage their personal data. We've made very strong progress in the past nine months, since the security breach, but we still have a lot of work to do. Our focus is clear. Stepping back, I'm incredibly excited about the path forward for Equifax. Very excited! This is a great business and a great space. We have unique data assets and insights delivered \u2013 solutions to our customers. We are making strong progress winning back trust and confidence with our customers as we return to a more normal mode of operations and we feel real momentum in our USIS business. As I mentioned earlier, I will continue to spend a majority of my time with Paulino and the USIS team to accelerate the return of USIS to the growth path that it's delivered historically. At the same time, our big investments in IT infrastructure will deliver industry leading capabilities. Our significant investments in security will bring us to an industry leading position in protecting consumer data. We have the right team in place to drive this transformation and we are laser focused and energized around delivering in the second half, and the future ahead for Equifax. Thanks and with that, let me hand it over to John. John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.: Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I will generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis, but will refer to non-GAAP results as well. For 2018, additional items excluded from our non-GAAP results are the one-time costs related to the cybersecurity incident, and the one-time benefits for adjustments to uncertain tax positions. We will provide the details on this item so you can consider it in your analysis. In total, in 2Q 2018, we incurred non-recurring costs related to the cybersecurity incident of $71 million. These have been partially offset by insurance recoveries of $35 million, resulting in net non-recurring charge of $36 million. The non-recurring charge is excluded from our adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted EPS. The $71 million of gross cost includes $16 million were generally for legal fees and other professional services, principally related to outstanding litigation and government investigations related to the cybersecurity incident and $55 million were generally for one-time incremental project and other costs incurred to implement our data security and technology plans and to improve our technology infrastructure. Total non-recurring and one-time incremental project and other gross costs incurred year-to-date were $150 million and since 3Q 2017, related to the cybersecurity incident, were $314 million. We have $125 million of cybersecurity insurance under our E&O policy against which we have received the payments to-date of $95 million, which partially offsets the cost referenced above. We continue to expect to make claims to fully utilize the policy. For Equifax, in 2Q 2018, as Mark indicated revenue of $877 million was up over 2% from 2Q 2017, both on a reported and local currency basis, and at the midpoint of the constant currency expectation we discussed in April. At the time of our conference call in April, our expectation was for local currency growth of 2% to 3%, with reported growth of 3% to 4% reflecting foreign exchange rates at the time which would have generated an FX benefit to revenue of about 1%. Cash EPS in the second quart of $1.56 was down $0.04 per share from last year, and at the high end of our expectations. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.0% in 2Q 2018, down 410 basis points from the record 39.1% margin we had in 2Q 2017, but up 150 basis points from 1Q 2018. About half of the reduction in adjusted EBITDA is directly related to the increased ongoing cost we discussed at the beginning of the year, specifically the ongoing cost due to the security and related technology, our transformation risk office and increased insurance costs. Much of the increases in security and technology related ongoing costs are being incurred directly in business units. The improvement in sequential EBITDA margins is driven by margin growth in USIS as well as International. USIS revenue in 2Q 2018 was $325 million, down 2% when compared to the very strong second quarter of 2017 and slightly below the 1% year-to-year decline we saw in both 1Q 2018 and 4Q 2017, as well as our expectations. The decline in the overall mortgage market impacted USIS revenue negatively by about 1%. Sequentially, revenue was up 6%, consistent with average sequential growth over the last five years and slightly below the 7% sequential growth in 2Q 2017. The stronger sequential growth in 2Q 2017 was heavily driven by Financial Marketing Services. Total mortgage-related revenue for USIS was up 8%. Total mortgage related revenue for Equifax, including Workforce Solutions mortgage revenue was up 8%. Our mortgage revenue growth was stronger than the overall market which saw inquiries decline by 5%. USIS Mortgage Solutions business in which we sell tri bureau mortgage reports was benefited by the launch of 3 Bureau trended data in 1Q 2018 and increased share in Mortgage Solutions, the portion of our business that delivers tri bureau reports. In 3Q 2018, we expect mortgage market volumes to be down high-single digits versus 3Q 2017 and to weaken further in 4Q 2018. For all of 2018, we expect mortgage market volumes to be down high-single digit percent, an improvement from the down 10% we previously expected at the outset of the year. Online Information Solutions revenue was $224 million, down slightly less than 4% when compared to the year ago period. Core Online was down less, declining slightly less than 3%, with the reminder of the decline principally in identity and fraud solutions driven by reductions in our government customers. Commercial revenues within OIS were down slightly compared to the year ago period but up slightly when compared to 1Q 2018, reflecting the progress we are making in our transition to the commercial financial network. Sequentially, OIS was up 2%, when compared to 1Q 2018 and core Online was up 3%. This was in line with the average for OIS over the last five years of about 3% and 2Q 2017 sequential growth of 3%. Again, a portion of the slightly weaker sequential growth this year reflects the weakening of the mortgage market between 1Q and 2Q and the increase in share in the Mortgage Solutions business in 2Q. Financial Marketing Services revenue was $55 million in 2Q 2018, down 9%, compared to a very strong 2Q 2017, which grew 15%. As Mark mentioned earlier, several transactions we had expected to close in 2Q slips to later in the year. We still expect these transactions to close. Sequentially, Financial Marketing Services was up 21% from 1Q 2018, a very good performance, below the 31% we saw in 2Q 2017 but above the average for the last five years, and the second highest sequential growth rate over that five-year period. As we have discussed previously, the impact on the USIS selling process as customers completed their security reviews was principally on our ability to sell new product into certain customers, to sell batch transactions in Financial Marketing Services and some impact as well to Online. Also, as we have discussed, we have seen our competitors be more aggressive. Overall, this has resulted in lost sales and share. As Mark discussed earlier, we believe we have made very good progress with customers and now for the substantial majority of customers are able to actively participate in new sales opportunities but we expect will benefit our sales efforts toward the end of 2018, but principally into 2019. The adjusted EBITDA margin for USIS was 47.7%, down 380 basis points from last year, but up 360 basis points from 1Q 2018. Similar to 1Q 2018, year-to-year USIS margins in 2Q 2018 were principally impacted by the following factors, specifically increased third-party costs, principally in mortgage, negative revenue mix, including a higher mix of lower margin Mortgage Solutions and increased security-related and other technology costs. We continue to expect USIS 2018 revenue to be flat to up slightly from 2017 for the full year. For the second half of 2018, reflecting the items that impacted the first half of 2018, we expect USIS EBITDA margins to approach the levels delivered in 2Q 2018. 3Q 2018 EBITDA margins will likely be lower than 4Q 2018, as mortgage revenue generally is lowest in the fourth quarter. Workforce Solutions revenue was $208 million in the quarter, up 7% when compared to 2Q 2017. Verification Services had another very strong quarter with 15% revenue growth, driven by double-digit growth across government, talent solutions, healthcare and auto, and also was better than our expectations. We also grew both active and total records again in 2Q 2018. Employer Services revenue was $58 million, was down 9%, or about $6 million from last year. As Mark indicated earlier, the decline was principally in unemployment claims and our ACA related business, Workforce Analytics. However, as we look to the second half, we believe Employer Services will see growth as unemployment claims stabilizes and we see growth principally in our employee services businesses, including I-9 and onboarding. The Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margin was 47.6% in 2Q 2018, down 360 basis points from 2Q 2017. The decline was more than explained by the expected increase in costs related to security and technology and increased investment in sales and marketing, partially offset by positive mix due to the growth in Verifier. Given the positive revenue mix driven by strong growth in Verification Services that we expect to continue throughout 2018, we expect to see continued sequential improvement in Workforce Solutions margins. For the full year, we continue to expect Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margins to be flat to up slightly versus 2017. International revenue was $250 million in 2Q 2018, up 8% on a reported and local currency basis. Asia Pacific revenue was $86 million, up 12% in U.S. dollars and in local currency driven by continued strong growth in our commercial business. Europe's revenues was $72 million in 2Q 2018, up 6% in U.S. dollars and down 1% in local currency. We saw low-double digit local currency growth in our combined UK and Spain credit operations. This was offset by a local currency revenue decline in our debt management business, specifically in our venture with the UK government. As Mark mentioned earlier, we expect to see improved performance in the debt management business overall in the third quarter, and a return to growth in the fourth quarter of this year. Latin America's revenue was $54 million in 2Q 2018, up 2% in U.S. dollars and up 15% in local currency. Revenue growth was broad based, with strong double-digit local currency growth in Argentina, Chile, Ecuador and Mexico. Beginning in early May, the country of Argentina saw a substantial increase in inflation and currency devaluation of the Argentinian peso. In the quarter, Equifax Argentina continued to perform well, although we are expecting a more significant impact from foreign exchange in the second half of 2018. Also beginning in the third quarter, under GAAP accounting, Argentina will be considered a highly inflationary economy and foreign exchange changes related monetary assets will be recognized in the income statement. We will exclude these impacts from our GAAP results beginning in the third quarter, and do not expect them to be material to our consolidated results. Canada's revenue was $38 million, up 13% in U.S. dollars and up 8% in local currency. Canada's growth was broad based and continues to reflect on their strong execution. International's adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.5% in 2Q 2018, down 40 basis points from 2Q 2017 but up 110 basis points from 1Q 2018. The year-over-year decline reflects the expected increased spend in security and technology, as well as increased investment and sales generation. We expect EBITDA margins to continue to increase as we move through the second half of 2018. Global Consumer Solutions revenue was $94 million in 2Q 2018, down 5% on a reported and local currency basis. As Mark covered, our U.S. consumer direct revenue, which now represents just over 30% of GCS revenue, declined more than 25% in the quarter as we have suspended advertising. Our partner-based business which now represents over half of the GCS revenue grew substantially and offset the majority of this decline. As Mark indicated, we intend to restart limited marketing in the U.S. consumer direct business in the fourth quarter. GCS adjusted EBITDA margin was 31% in 2Q 2018, flat with 2Q 2017. The net decline in revenue and related gross margin was offset by lower marketing expense in our U.S. consumer direct business resulting in flat margins. In 3Q 2018, we expect a further sequential revenue decline, reflecting a further decline in U.S. consumer direct business and a resulting sequential reduction in EBITDA margins. Also, as we move into 4Q 2018 we would expect EBITDA margins to decline relative to 3Q 2018, reflecting both the lower U.S. consumer direct revenue and an increase in marketing expense, as we seek to add new consumers to our U.S. consumer direct business. In the second quarter, general corporate expense was $73 million. Excluding the non-recurring costs associated with the cybersecurity incident, the adjusted general corporate expense for the quarter was $63 million, up $16 million from 2Q 2017. Over half of this reflects the increased ongoing costs we discussed at the beginning of the year, specifically the ongoing cost due to security and related technology, the free Lock & Alert product, our transformation and risk office and increased insurance costs. Our GAAP effective tax rate of 13.7% includes GAAP only tax benefits of $14 million related to adjustments from uncertain tax positions resulting from a settlement with tax authorities for prior tax years and $2 million from the income tax effective stock awards. For 2Q 2018, the effective tax rate used in calculating adjusted EPS was 23.5%. This lower tax rate in 2Q 2018 reflects the following factors. First, we believe our ongoing effective tax rate is approximately 25%, down from the 26.5% we discussed in April. Catching up year-to-date to this lower tax rate in the second quarter, as well as several small discrete tax items resulted in a non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter of 23.5%. For 2018, we now expect our effective tax rate, including discrete items to be about 24.5% with 3Q 2018 somewhat lower than that level. In 2Q 2018, the 150 basis points benefit between the 23.5% effective tax rate achieved and our 25% ongoing rate, was a benefit of about $0.025 per share. In 2Q 2018, operating cash flow was $235 million and free cash flow was $173 million, up 4% and down 2% compared to the prior year respectively. Through June, operating cash flow was $355 million, and free cash flow was $236 million, up 8% and 3% respectively. Net cash received from insurance recoveries in 2Q 2018 and year-to-date was $45 million. Capital spending incurred in the quarter was $92 million and year-to-date was $149 million. Capital spending was up sequentially in the second quarter, principally based on the renewal and extension of a large software database licensing agreement. Year-to-date, capital spending is over 8% of revenue. For all of 2018, we continue to expect capital spending to be approximately 8% of revenue. Total net debt at the end of 2Q 2018 was $2.31 billion. Our gross leverage was 2.58 times and net leverage was 2.26 times at the end of 2Q 2018. In 2Q 2018 we issued $1 billion of three and five year fixed and floating rate senior notes. The net proceeds of the sale of notes were used to repay borrowings under the revolver, term loan and commercial paper program. We now have no meaningful debt with a maturity prior to 3Q 2021. We did not repurchase shares in 2Q 2018 and do not expect to in 3Q 2018. Before returning to guidance, I wanted to cover the impact of the substantial strengthening of the dollar that occurred in May and June. When we provided guidance, we assume FX will remain at the current levels through the entire period. In 2Q 2018, as we indicated earlier, actual FX results versus 2Q 2017 was only a very slight negative impact to revenue. However, relative to our expectations for FX, when we provided 2Q 2018 guidance, the movement in FX in May and June negatively impacted revenue by about 1% and EPS by $0.02 per share. The impact of changes on our guidance for all of 2018 is, of course, much larger. The impact on revenue of FX rates at their current levels relative to our prior expectations is a negative impact to revenue of almost 2% per quarter in 3Q 2018 and 4Q 2018 and on the order of $0.03 per share in each quarter. In total, for all of 2018, the impact on revenue of the stronger dollar is a negative impact of over 1%, and on the order of $0.08 per share. Now turning to our guidance for 3Q 2018, at current exchange rates, we expect revenue to be between $853 and $863 million, reflecting reported growth of 2% to 3% versus 3Q 2017. Foreign exchange, based on current exchange rates, is expected to be negative, almost 2%. Local currency revenue growth is expected to be 4% to 5% verses 3Q 2017. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.39 and $1.44 per share versus 3Q 2017. FX is expected to negatively impact adjusted EPS by approximately $0.03 per share. Using the midpoint of our guidance range, 3Q 2018 is about $0.11 per share weaker than 3Q 2017. In addition, the lower tax rate in 3Q 2018 is a benefit of over $0.10 a share. Offsetting this over $0.20 per share is the following three factors : increased security cost for security, technology transformation and insurance-related to the cybersecurity incident, which we have discussed, of over $0.10 a share; expected negative FX and higher interest costs of over $0.05 a share; and in 3Q 2017 we had a benefit from lower bonus accruals which will not recur of about $0.05 a share. Sequentially, again using the midpoint of our guidance range, 3Q 2018 is down about $0.14 per share versus 2Q 2018. The factors explaining this lower adjusted EPS are : about half in the business units principally as lower GCS operating profit is partially offset by nice growth in Workforce; USIS is down slightly due to revenue reduction; and the remainder principally from increased security, technology transformation and insurance costs related to the cybersecurity incident. Negative FX and increased interest expense and each year third quarter equity expense increases sequentially versus second quarter as we issue employee equity grants in the third quarter. Our full year 2018 guidance for Equifax revenue and EPS are unchanged from our previous guidance. In total, we continue to expect Equifax revenue for the year to be between $3.425 and $3.525 billion. This reflects revenue growth of 2% to 5%. FX based on current rates is expected to be over 1% negative to revenue growth in 2018. This assumes total mortgage market volumes declined high-single digit percent in 2018, which is slightly better than our previous guidance. We continue to expect adjusted EPS to be between $5.80 and $6 per share unchanged from our April guidance. FX is expected to be approximately $0.08 per share negative to EPS in 2018. Given the substantial change in FX from our original expectations, we believe it is more likely we will be in the middle to lower end of our adjusted EPS guidance. For perspective, looking historically at the last five years, excluding 2017, our adjusted EPS in 3Q and 4Q have been sequentially about flat. We expect in 2018 to incur approximately $225 million of net incremental costs for investments in technology and data security projects and legal and professional fees being incurred specifically to address litigation claims in governmental and regulatory investigations related to the cybersecurity incident. This represents gross cost of approximately $300 million offset by $75 million of insurance proceeds. This represents a $25 million increase in gross costs from our prior estimate. Investments in technology and data security are expected to represent just over 75% of these costs. These costs are being excluded from our non-GAAP financial results and guidance. In 3Q 2018, we expect these gross costs to exceed the levels incurred in either 1Q 2018 or 2Q 2018. These estimates do not include any estimates of damages, fines or other amounts that may result from the resolution of litigation and regulatory investigations related to the cybersecurity incident. Our first half results provide a very strong start to 2018, relative to our full year guidance. Before turning it over to the operator, as this is Jeff Dodge's last earnings call with Equifax, I want to thank him for the tremendous job he has done over the past 10-plus years. He is the standard by which IR professionals are measured in our industry, and he also was a critical player in Equifax strategic and operating decisions over that period. Thanks from me and the entire Equifax team, enjoy a well-earned retirement. And with that operator, we will open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now take our next question from George Mihalos of Cowen. Please go ahead. George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Good morning, gentlemen. And it's good to hear about the momentum in USIS and the reiteration of guidance there. John, maybe you can talk a little bit about the cadence in USIS growth 3Q and 4Q, is it going to be relatively steady? I know the comparison is a bit easier in 3Q. And also what the contribution exactly will be from DataX that will be included in the USIS segment? John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.: Yeah, George. Thanks for the question. We're not going to be specific obviously in terms of the type of growth cadence by third and fourth quarter, but needless to say, as Mark indicated, we expect to have growth in those periods as well as growth for the year. The contribution from DataX is relatively small. The company is quite small and the contribution really isn't very large. George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, great. And just two quick ones if I may, Mark, the decision to kind of stay committed to the GCS direct business, if you could talk a little bit about that and coming back into the market in terms of advertising spend. And then just as it relates to Europe, have we sort of hit the bottom in terms of that minus one local currency growth that we saw in 2Q? Does that now start to turn positive in 3Q and then improve upon that in 4Q? Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: Sure. I'll start with GCS and maybe John can start on the Europe one. On GCS, we think this is a business that's important to us, dealing with consumers. We have a lot of interactions with consumers when they are dealing with us on the credit bureau side. And we had a nice business prior to the breach that we think we can continue with. We've been consistent in prior calls and meetings that we've had with our investors and others, George, that this isn't a business that we're going to have as the front of our strategy. It's not our primary focus, but it's one that we think is a business that's a good one for Equifax and that we'll start working our way back into doing some advertising and selling value-added products later in the year. John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.: Yeah. In terms of Europe, right, I mean, basically the discussion is around debt management as you know, and we do expect to see some improvements in the debt management business in the third quarter and we expect to see that business return to growth in the fourth quarter. So that \u2013 those should both be very positive effects for Europe. George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks, guys. Operator : We will now take our next question from Manav Patnaik of Barclays. Please go ahead. Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, this is actually Greg calling on for Manav. I just wanted to see if I could get any additional color on how you're thinking about the phasing of the IT and cybersecurity investments in terms of what's going in the buckets this year versus into next year. And also along those lines now that you have the CISO and the CTO in place, has that changed any areas of focus or emphasis on the investments? Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: Yes, good question, Greg. First, I think, John, gave you the guidance as I did, that we're taking up our forecast for this year by $25 million of the spend that we expect to do broadly. The bulk of that $25 million is between security and IT. Beyond this year, we're not ready to give any indications of what it looks like for 2019, but I think we've been clear that we expect to have a sizable investment again next year. And our goal is as we get into the fourth quarter, or later in the \u2013 probably in the fourth quarter versus third quarter, to give some real visibility to you and others around that as far as what our spend will be next year. With regards to our new CTO from IBM, Bryson, he's only been on the ground for three weeks. We don't expect any significant changes in either our spend level or forecast. How we're going to spend it as a result of him joining, but we do expect him to make some refinements to it. He's got really deep experience around going from legacy to private as well as public cloud and that's part of our strategy. So we think he's going to help us enhance that. He's very product oriented, which will also be a positive for us and there may be some tweaking, if you want to call it, to our plan. I think his bigger impact will be in the plan that we have, he -as that gets shaped in the, call it the, next three, four, five months and we'll be ready to share that with you later in the year. Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That makes sense. In terms of USIS, I think you talked about some of the larger customers and the conversations you are having there. Maybe if we think about it from a vertical perspective, are there any areas that are starting to turn on the spigot faster versus slower and how we should think about that going forward? Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: I guess it's hard to think about any verticals that would be any different. When we had the call back in April, we said, look, fourth quarter was really tough. First quarter was very tough with regards to customers wanting to understand our security plans and getting back to giving us some confidence and trust and when we talked in April, we felt some momentum there and some positiveness. That continued into May and June as we're into July. I think I tried to indicate, it's just a small handful, like, less than \u2013 it's less than the five fingers on my hand where we have, what I would characterize some ongoing tensions with customers that still want to see more of our security plans. The vast majority of the rest are just back to normal mode of operations. And really, it's just our focus now is just getting our NPIs back in front of them, getting that collaboration with their risk teams, their marketing teams around how we can help them grow. And I tried to be quite consistent in that, the message I've gotten everywhere is that Equifax is valued. They value our differentiated data, meaning we've got data assets that we can bring that others can't, which is a real value for us. From my perspective, we're kind of getting back to that more normal mode of operations. And I'm quite energized around Paulino coming back in. You know and others on the call know, he's an experienced leader, he's an aggressive leader, he's a commercial leader, and he and I and the team are going to be laser focused. We have been for the last couple of months and we will be for the rest of the year on really getting ourselves back to that normal growth mode in USIS. And we expect to see progress as we go week by week and month by month through rest of this year, into next year. Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. Thanks and congrats to Jeff. Operator : Thank you. We will now take our next question from Tim McHugh of William Blair. Please go ahead. Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you. First, I guess, just coming back to the discussions with customers. I know you said vast majority of them gotten better. Is it still the case, I guess, as you move further where you're not seeing a disruption to the kind of the Online business, it's more the back processing? Or is that still a fair description? And then secondly, you talked about competitors being aggressive, I guess. Have you seen that intensify or change at all? Or is it basically is an environment similar to what you would have described three to six months ago. Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: Yeah. They kind of tie together, Tim, it's a good question. Look, it's a competitive space, every space is. We operate versus 2Principle (51:37) and dozens of other competitors. And it was competitive before the security incident last fall and it's competitive since then. And so I think you point out that it is and will continue to be. Our competitors, I'm sure, it wasn't lost on them what happened to us last September and they would certainly probably try to take advantage of that in the past nine months. That said we're going to be aggressive, too. We're going to be aggressive about maintaining our business. We're going to be aggressive about getting new business. And your question about Online versus batch, for the most part, I would characterize any changes in Online of being really related more to that normal competitive environment that we all live in versus something related to September. There's no question that the September incident impacted our batch and some of our NPI stuff. We've been clear about that. And you know our competitors have put up some really impressive numbers in the U.S. and a lot of that has been them taking share from us, we believe, in some of the batch and new product stuff. We're laser focused in getting back our share of that, as we go into July and the third quarter and the second half of the year and we expect to do so. John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.: And as we talked about before, right, with NPI, a lot of NPI it drives Online. So, when you're asking does it impact Online revenue, certainly it does, absolutely. So, there's been impacts across the board, as we said. Online, batch, have both been impacted by the fact that we were impeded in our ability to sell, absolutely. Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: And Tim, just want to \u2013 one other point about \u2013 this, obviously, is an active world. And we're out there competing. But last night I got a verbal from our commercial team, from one of our U.S. customers that moved some business to us in a positive way that was with one of our competitors. So those things happen all the time. But, the good news is, is its happening, meaning we're out there winning in the marketplace. And I expect to see that to continue, particularly under Paulino's leadership and with the kind of focus and effort I'm going to put on it \u2013 continue to put on it as we go through the rest of the year. Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, great. And then just secondly, the increase to the spending on technology, I guess, is it just proving to be more expensive than you would have said before? Are you increasing the, I guess, the magnitude, I guess, of what you're trying to achieve or are you trying to get it done sooner? I guess how should we think about that spending? John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.: Yeah. I would think about it as pace, right? So, when we gave you the initial guidance back in March, we were in the process of trying to ramp the resources necessary for us to deliver the changes that we committed to. And quite honestly at that time, that the \u2013 the exact pace at which we could ramp that level of resources wasn't completely clear. So, what we found is, I think, we've been able to ramp a little more effectively, so that our pace of completion is faster. And I think when we gave the guidance initially, back in March, we said to the extent we could go quicker, we would. And I think that's what you're seeing, since we can go quicker, we are. Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, great. Thank you. Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: Thanks, Tim. Operator : We will now take our next question from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust. Please go ahead. Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hey, good morning, guys. Appreciate taking the question. Mark, with regard to the aggressiveness of the competition, which I guess should be expected and your commentary about growing and, you know, improving consumer customer, I should say receptivity, are you as confident now recognizing 100 days in as you might otherwise have been about having the right technology and the right solutions in USIS, is there \u2013 you know given the current offerings, the potential to meaningfully reaccelerate the growth in your view, is it just a matter of continuing to improve the selling motion and customer relations and ramping NPI? Or do you think there's new technology or new solutions that you might need to fill gaps at this point? Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: Yeah, it's a great question, Andrew. I think last time we spoke I was maybe 10 days into my role and now being three plus months I covered a lot more ground. And I was \u2013 I know a lot more now and I'm even more energized frankly about our market position. I believe, and I hear this from our customers, that's where I get the data point from is that our customers' view our data assets to be differentiated. So that's a very good thing. Second is, they view our products, our technology, our NPI cadence, our DNA resources as being a real asset also. So I view that as a real advantage and I'm excited about that. I think we've also been clear that we've got some technology opportunities to allow us to speed up our ability to get products to market. Our competitors, my sense is over the last five years, made some investments there that we did not, we're doing that now. And that's part of the investments we're making this year and that will roll into next year that will allow us to be even more differentiated, I believe, as we go forward. And the last one is that, there's great commercial relationships with Equifax. Those customers \u2013 the customer I was with yesterday has been with us for 40 years. And they are one of our key customers and we're primary there. And there's just a very strong relationship with or without the data security breach. They were supportive as we went through it. They paused, if you want it, in the first six months about new things, but now we are back to the races. So, I'm really energized about the future and I don't need to remind you, if you go back literally a year ago and look at USIS, with our data assets, with how we went to market, with our commercial infrastructure, the business was performing very well. And 12 months later, with the data security breach, obviously, putting some pressure on the business and the team, I look at that and it gives me great confidence along with the dozens and dozens of commercial discussions I've had, that we're going to get back. We'll get back to that growth mode that you're used to and that we want to deliver for you and our other shareholders. And I add on top of that the team. I'm really energized about Paulino agreeing to step back into a role that he did really well. Many of you saw him operate, you saw him lead and he's been there a week. I had dinner with he and his leadership team last night and they are charged up. And that is a long list of things that gives me confidence and it gives me more energy and confidence, frankly than I had when I was two weeks in. So, a long answer to your question, which is a very good one. Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And if I may just follow-up with a quick one. Just for my own edification, when I think about Ignite, Cambrian, just as a framework, could you put a little meat on that bone for me, just in terms of an example of maybe a vertical or a specific function where that technology changes the sort of the, I guess, the value proposition or specific example of Ignite, Cambrian's value proposition, I guess. So we can think about it a little more clearly. Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: John might be able to give a better specific example. But I will just give you kind of in a generality. By getting Ignite into our customers and allowing their data and analytics, their risk team to have quicker and easier access to our data is incredibly valuable. And remember, Andrew, I was a customer. I ran Synchrony for nine years, so I know how data is used. I know how data and analytics teams work from a customer perspective. And this tool is so valuable to them to have really broad access to our data to experiment, to model and by having Ignite embedded with our customer, it just makes us more sticky with them. It makes their access to us more valuable. It allows them to test and model things in just a faster fashion, allows us to co-collaborate with them. So it's an incredibly valuable tool that as you know, we're actively deploying in the marketplace with our customers that we think is just going to be another step change in that integration and close commercial collaboration with our customers. Would you add, John, to that? John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.: Only thing I'd add, we're very complete with Ignite Direct, obviously, also our customers their data scientists can contribute their own data... Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: Correct. John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.: ...can use third-party market data and can use our NeuroDecisioning (sic) [NeuroDecision] (01:00:24)Technology to generate products and understand where that relationships exist that we can deliver faster. And as Mark said, the technology investments we're making will allow us to get those products to market faster with those customers. And I know you know this Jeffrey, Ignite Marketplace is more of an app, right? So it allows our business users within our customers to take a look and run analytics against their broader business more simply, like you would with an app, as opposed to requiring a data scientist to do the work. So we think we have a great solution in Cambrian, Ignite Direct and Marketplace and we think we can be very well. Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : We will now take our next question from David Ridley-Lane of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Sure. Good morning. So, you know, with the strategic decision to continue on the U.S. direct to consumer business, it sounds like you'll restart marketing in the fourth quarter. Heard that you expect that marketing spend to return to pre-breach levels, just to help level set expectations for your investors, would that be in the kind of single-digit million of spending per quarter? Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: Yes, we typically \u2013 as you know, David, we don't give the number out on that, but I would say we're still finalizing those plans. We've been consistent that \u2013 I've been consistent that we view this as a business that we want to be in. It's a business that we're never going to be as big as some of our competitors, use that as a boundary on it. And our entry is going to be what I would characterize as measured and whether we're actually at those levels or not, I think it's difficult to forecast at this stage, but we're going to walk our way into this in the fourth quarter and then we'll look at their performance and then make decisions about what we do in 2019 and everything we talked about is inside of kind of the guidance we've given you. John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.: Yeah. And just in the fourth quarter, since we're just starting to do it as Mark said, you shouldn't expect to see anything really large, right. Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: Yeah. John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.: It's something we've ramped into slowly. Again, all we're trying to do is give people a perspective that we're not looking at a large re-entry here. We weren't really large in that business in 2016 and 2017 either. This is a relatively small business that doesn't have large investment. David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And I'll take another approach to the question about ongoing IT and security costs. Will you be fully ramped up in terms of staffing and head count and spending on those plans in the second half of 2018? And I understand you don't know if those costs will be up or down in 2019, but potentially, could you start to see some cost savings from simplifications but benefits from these, the work that you're doing in 2018 as you move into 2019? Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: Yeah, I think on the first half of your question about kind of getting fully staffed, it's \u2013 staffing is difficult to forecast but it's our goal to kind of be at a full staffing level. I know Bryson is looking at bringing in some new talent just like Jamil, our CISO did. And that will happen. It's happening as we speak. He's already worked a couple of hires. So my view to that first question is that we should be at kind of a run rate of the team as we finish out the year. With regards to 2019, I think we've been clear that we're going to work those plans between now and the fourth quarter and share those with you once they are complete. And with regards to cost base, too early to predict that. But to be clear, our goal in making these significant IT investments are to allow us to accelerate our revenue growth, to increase our speed of products to market. And as you point out, just simplify our structure both from redundant systems and using cloud, either private or public as appropriate to improve our cost structure and, yes, we expect through these investments to have efficiencies that will deliver along with the revenue growth and as we define those, which our goal is to do that as we get into the latter parts of the year, Bryson has some time to get on the ground, we'll share them with you. David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you very much. Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : We will now take our next question from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, sir. Allison Chou - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning. This is Allison Chou on for George. Could you speak to trends you're seeing in Workforce Solutions and particularly Employer Services post breach and where you expect the margin improvement in the back half of the year to come from? John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.: Yes. So just, again, I think we talked a bit about this in the script, right. I mean, what you're seeing in terms of the weakness in the first half of the year is principally around unemployment, insurance claims, our tax services business as well as in our ACA business. A lot of that's being driven obviously on the UC side by unemployment and in ACA I think it's kind of well chronicled what's going on there. So, I think what we're expecting to see as we go through the rest of this year is that we believe that those businesses are somewhat stabilizing and we're starting to see a little bit of growth in some of our employee services business. By employee services, it's the services we provide to our customers to help them board employees and manage their employees, and there I think we're expecting to see some improvement. In our I-9 business we're expecting to see some improvement, in our onboarding business and that should allow us to deliver a little bit of growth as we go through the back half. So we believe the declines should be behind us and we're starting to see \u2013 we expect to see some growth as we go through the rest of this year. Margins in that business, in the total Workforce Solution business, we don't give margins by sub-segment. Again, you saw margins down a little bit in the first half. I think we said specifically related to the substantial security investments that we made, as well as the decision to add more marketing and sales, because that business is doing very, very well. So I think what you're seeing is Verifier growth continues and escalates as you go through the year. And as you've seen so far, and as we see employers somewhat flatten out, therefore the growth of that business grows. It's a very high variable margin business and we're expecting that you'll see gross margins increase from the levels we're at right now. Allison Chou - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. And in terms of NPI and product generation and collaboration with customers, can you give more color on the areas of focus there, any competitive changes you've seen and maybe which businesses you expect to most benefit from NPI going forward, whether you expect that mid-50s level to ramp meaningfully in 2019 and 2020? Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: Yes, the NPI focus that, Allison, we've talked about on the call today and we tend to talk about with you is really around our core credit bureau or USIS and its both in the U.S. and of course our products travel globally. I don't see any different trends or competitive impacts there. This has been a really strong muscle for Equifax for a lot of years, and I think we've talked in prior calls that we've worked hard to make sure we protect the resources around our NPI processes as we're ramping up our IT and data security investments, and it feels like we've done a good job at that, meaning that the NPI engine is still working at Equifax. And with regards to getting north of the kind of pace we've had, I don't think we see that and I'm actually quite pleased that we're still on pace with kind of a consistent and attractive NPI engine working at Equifax. It's a big priority for us. We have a lot of people focused on it. It's one of our \u2013 it has been one of our growth levers and it will be going forward. So it's clearly a priority. Allison Chou - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: All right, great. John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.: If you look at \u2013 International has been very strong at NPI too. So historically, and they continue to work at it. International's performed very well on NPI. Allison Chou - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Great, thanks, guys. Operator : We will now take our next question from Brett Huff of Stephens. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Good morning and thanks for taking the question, guys. Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: Hey, Brett. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: And Jeff, congratulations to you. It's been good working with you. Two questions from me. On the EBITDA declines that you mention, I think, John, I think you mentioned this, you said about half of the overall decline year-over-year for the company in margin was due to the ongoing security investments and things like that. I'm just trying to make sure I'm parsing out kind of what the one-timers are, if you will, that you're excluding versus what the ongoing base cost will be. Is that \u2013 if we just do that math and take half of that margin and multiply it times the revenue, does that give us a reasonably good ballpark on what the current ongoing investment will be? And I know 2019 may be more or less. I'm not asking that question. But is that the right way to think about magnitude from an ongoing addition to the base that we should expect to continue? John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.: Well, maybe getting at it another way, right? When we did guidance initially back in March, for the full year, we indicated that you'd see about $0.40 a share from investments in security, technology, free product Lock & Alert and insurance, right? And we're kind of on pace for that type of number, not exactly. But there'll be \u2013 but it's \u2013 we're pretty much on pace for that type of number. So I think that's the way you should think about what those types of ongoing costs look like as we're looking at this year. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Okay, it's helpful. And the second question, you all talked a little bit about getting closer to your customers and you also mentioned the growth in some of your competitors has been better for a variety of reasons. Wondering, in terms of moving to reaccelerate, or working on reaccelerating particularly the USIS business, how do you think about getting closer to your customers versus the money you want to put into NPI or the processes around those two things? It sounds like there's a new focus on getting closer to the customer. How does that rank in terms of growth acceleration relative to NPI? Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: Well, they are both important. The NPI, Brett, from my perspective, has been a strong muscle of Equifax for a long time. So, that's in place and I think it's well organized. We've got very rigorous processes in place. We collaborate with customers. So that one's working and the thing we try to manage, what we're trying to manage this year is make sure we keep the resources dedicated to that, so it doesn't slow down when we're doing our security and IT transformation. So, that's happening. The closer to the customer one is really one that's \u2013 an initiative that I'm really driving. And it's obviously quite logical. If you're closer to your customers, you're going to be able to engage more in commercial discussions, you're going to be able to show them new products. You're going to be able to show them new data analytics to help them grow. And it's really probably twofold. One, it's my DNA. That's how I lead as a business leader. I want our team to be close to customers. I think Equifax has always been that way. And it's quite natural, following the data security breach last September, the organization turned somewhat inward, which is natural. There was a lot of work done inside of the business and that focus externally, when I landed, call it three months ago wasn't where I would want it to be. And that's what I've just been ramping up. And I'm leading from my chair, by spending, call it half of my time in the field with customers. I'm in there with our key client teams and with our data and analytics teams. And it's really a mode of operations that I want to be a part of. And with regards to priority, I would say the NPI and being close to customers kind of go together. I'm just putting more emphasis on it. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. That's \u2013 and then just one smaller question on the analytics, the Cambrian, Ignite group, kind of most of your customers have something that is similar, a kind of flexible data and analytics product. How do you all see the differentiation between what you offer and maybe what they offer? Is it in the analytics or is it in the base data? Or is there a simple way to think about that from us looking outside in? John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.: Yeah, I think outside in I think it's what we've talked about really consistently. The differentiation that we believe we bring is the data assets, as Mark mentioned, right? So we think we have differentiated data assets beyond credit in terms of The Work Number, in terms of NCTUE, in terms of now obviously DataX, right? So we think that the data assets we bring to bear is what helps differentiate what we offer. We think we have an outstanding technology platform, and we think it's incredibly flexible. It's very modern. So we're extremely happy with it. And also the other thing that's critical to remember is NeuroDecisioning (sic) [NeuroDecision] (01:13:22), right? It's a patent pending activity where we can do machine learning and through that machine learning we can actually determine reason codes. And so use the machine learning algorithm to determine algorithms that we can sell to customers and that they can use in production because we can determine reason codes. So, all of those things, with think, are what give us a product that's extremely strong. I'm sure our competitors have reasons they like theirs. Those are the reasons we like ours. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Great. That's really helpful. Appreciate the time, guys. Operator : Thank you. We will now take our next question from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, Mark. Are you able to give us any more color on your confidence on USIS returning to organic revenue growth in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter? I know you said more normal commercial activity, obviously. I see the easier comp. Is there any more specific you could give me around that dynamic of returning to growth and staying in the growth mode for USIS? Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: Yeah. I'll start will \u2013 I've been \u2013 said maybe four or five different ways in this call that the focus from our team is like crystal clear and laser. It's our biggest priority. It's one that the team is on, the addition of Paulino, we think is going to be quite attractive. I'm spending a lot of time there. So, the resources and focus are there. And then it's \u2013 I'm really giving kind of my perspectives and the team perspectives. As I said, I had dinner with the team last night. We had a detailed discussion with them last week and where we're going through pipelines. And when we see pipelines building of commercial activity, that gives me confidence. When you \u2013 when I'm out with customers and we hear them, and then just have a dialog, yesterday, last Friday, the earlier last week when I'm meeting with customers, they are ready to get back into a growth mode. You think about it for your customer and they're an Equifax partner, meaning we've been doing business with them, they've got growth needs. They want to access our unique data. They want to access DataX. They want to use The Work Number. They want to use Ignite, because they want to grow. They've got their own growth challenges and we're one of the levers of growth for them. So, I've got a lot of confidence in the team. It feels like there's some wind building behind our sails, which I think is a positive. And we're focused on getting back to that growth mode. It's still going to take time. It's not going to be something that's going to happen tomorrow or next week, but the \u2013 with the pipeline building, converting those to deals and revenue, that's the kind of mode that we're going to be in as we go into \u2013 as we're in the third quarter already and as we go through the rest of the year. Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: Thanks, Andrew. Operator : Thank you. We will now take our next question from Jeff Meuler of Baird. Please go ahead. Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah, thanks. And a big thank you and congrats to Jeff from me as well. I guess first question on the Verifier growth, the mortgage market is down, the auto market is not overly growthy and you're calling it a really good rate and accelerating. I hear you on the records growth but anything else going on with Verifier, any sort of like new go-to-market product refinement, just any other leg to growth that's driving really good growth relative to the end market? John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.: Look, overall, they are continuing to execute on the strategies they have for an extended period of time. As the records continue to extend, then obviously that drives growth themselves. But it also makes the specific application more attractive in each of the end markets you just referenced, right? So, we talked about the markets that we're growing and they've done a nice job of selling into markets where the expanded record base now makes us even more attractive. They've started \u2013 they focused on NPI. They're offering new products that allow us to get more information to individual verticals. If, for example, they don't need the entire Work Number record, but they can use a subset of the record to drive revenue at a lower price we've structured products to allow that to be the case, and to also provide them historical information that may not be as valuable as current \u2013 as the current information, but it's valuable in their decisioning process. So, they've just broadened what we can sell and have been more effective in selling. So they've done a nice job. Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: Jeff, (01:17:54). We probably don't give workforce enough justice in dialoguing with you, at least since I've been here. This is a really good business. And from my perspective, we're still in the early innings of the kind of creativity we can bring about how The Work Number can be used, new verticals, new spaces, more penetration in auto, more use cases around government for verification. There are a lot of opportunities, and as John pointed out, and then how we deliver it. This is a very exciting business that we view as a growth engine for us, as we go through the rest of this year and into the future. And as I say, I view it as early innings, because there's just a lot of potential here. Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then, second, can you give us any kind of sensitivity to the potential outcomes from the ongoing conversations with the customers where you're still in the \u2013 working through the risk zone or getting them comfortable with your data security, et cetera? Like if one of those customers would go from primary to secondary or tertiary, is that a 1% consolidated revenue headwind? Is it more? Is it less? Just any sizing of that risk factor, thank you. Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: Yeah, it's hard to size. First off, it's very few. I think I'd characterized it as, like, less than five fingers on my hand. We got a couple that we're really working on. And what the dialog is, is they just want to see more progress on our security efforts. We're dialoguing with them on a biweekly, weekly basis. We're showing them our work plans. We make progress every day with them and I'm trying to be open and transparent with you, that sure, there are couple. I don't anticipate what you described happening, meaning us changing our position but growing with them is not happening right now. The NPI discussions aren't happening with a couple of customers and that's something we want to move them to the more normal mode of discussions and we're going to work on that. The vast, vast, vast majority of our customers, that's behind us. They understand our data security plans. They believe in them. They see the kind of spending we're making, the kind of people we're bringing in. So, their confidence in us executing that is quite strong. And the dialogs are normal and we're into testing products, testing data sets, putting agreements in place to roll out new products, that's where the vast majority of our customer discussions are. John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.: And you know this \u2013 our customer base is extremely diverse and we generally don't have really large customers but we have no customers that are near 3% of revenue, and any with that would be even moving up in that geography. The number is very small, right. Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: Yeah. Good point. Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will now take our next question from Bill Warmington of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, everyone. Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: Bill. Hey, Bill. William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : So first, shout out to Jeff Dodge and congratulations on setting a new record for the longest drum roll pre-retirement. Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: Well done! William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : So it sounds like the revenue momentum is improving and in the USIS, and we can see that in the sequential trends, and when do you think we'll start to see margins return to historical levels? Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: Do you want to take that margin question, John? Bill's question is when will margins return to historical levels? John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.: Yeah. So, we haven't really done a long-term model, Bill, right. So I mean if basically that's the question and so I think we'll be vindicated is \u2013 as we move forward here, we'll make a determination as to when we're ready to talk about the long-term model again, but we're just not there. So... Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: And, I think, Bill, we've also been clear in the last call and in other conversations, our goal is to do that. We're trying to do that before the end of the year. We want to have some more clarity around our legal discussions and some more clarity around the USIS trajectory and then some more clarity around our investment in technology spend and data security and IT. William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And then my second and final question, the DataX acquisition, I know that's a smaller deal. The \u2013 but it is the first acquisition that you guys have done since the breach last September. So is that a one-off or are you guys back in the M&A market? Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: Yeah, we've actually done a couple as I mentioned in my comments, Bill. We did one in Latin America and one in Workforce and then DataX, I don't know if this is number three or four. Is that... John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.: I think we've done four or five. Yeah. Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: Okay, so we've done four or five. And these have been bolt-ons and tuck-ins. And the other thing in my comments, Bill, I tried to be clear about is the M&A machine was never turned off. But If you want to characterize that way, we got it turned on meaning that our team is out there. We have monthly meetings on it. I meet with the team all the time, the team that works for me, that works on M&A, and we're in the marketplace. And we're going to be looking for more of these DataX type acquisitions where we can do something that's going to bolt-on to our business. I've been clear in prior discussions that I'm a bolt-on guy. Looking for acquisitions where we can either have capabilities or product or importantly data assets is a real priority for us. And at the same time, I don't foresee another Veda in our near future, but we look for those. That was an example of a platform that gave us a really great position in Australia and is going to turn out, I believe, to be a very attractive acquisition for us. You know, those are things that we're looking at, too. So the M&A machine is on. William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. Well, thank you very much. Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: Thanks, Bill. Operator : Thank you. We will now take our next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Please go ahead. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, thank you for squeezing me in here. I know you haven't come out with a longer term model yet, but I just want to ask you, after your first 100 days, is there anything that you are seeing within Equifax or you're anticipating from the data breach that longer term changes the way that this company operated within the industry? I mean historically, Equifax had a leadership position in terms of being a leader in terms of growth through the cycle, ability to generate certain amount of growth. Is there anything that you're seeing after taking more of a deep dive that says that over time you can't get back to more of a leadership position over here or is there \u2013 either with in terms of the assets you have, in terms of the position with the clients that you've got, or anything else that you're looking at? Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: Yeah. It's a great question. I think if you step back and look at Equifax, look at our Workforce Solutions and International franchises they performed well prior to the breach. They're performing extremely well post the breach. Those are strong and intact. And I look at those as really attractive businesses for Equifax going forward. And I mentioned earlier that I would characterize Workforce as being early innings, meaning there is just a lot of opportunities for Workforce here in the United States. And we're looking at bringing Workforce to a couple of other markets like Canada, the UK and perhaps Australia. So, you take those and \u2013 on USIS, there's no change in our differentiated assets. We've talked about that multiple times today. There's no change in our ability to bring new products to marketplace and obviously we took a real dent in customer confidence and trust as a result of security breach, but literally 12 months ago on this call, the second quarter last year, USIS was performing quite well and it's my expectation that we go back to that. Now, I'm going to be careful because I don't want to get into the long-term model, but when you think about the investments we're making in our data security, that's kind of table stakes. We're going to be an industry leading there, but the investments in our information technology have to deliver positive differentiation to us. When we get products to market quicker, when we're a more reliable data partner to our customers, that has to be positive to us in the future. And it has been pointed out in a prior question, our investments in our data infrastructure are going to deliver efficiencies when we have five versions of something we are running today, and we go to one, and you move either a private or public cloud, that's going to be a positive moving forward. So, we're going to spend more money on security. I think John has pointed that out. But when I think about the future for us, this is a business that performed extremely well for many, many years. I expect it to do the same in the future, to be a very strong competitor in our space, to be a great partner to our customers, and I'm very energized about the future for Equifax when you combine the underlying business and add to that the technology investment we're making, you get out into 2019, 2020, this is a very attractive business in our space. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, great. Thank you very much to that. And I also want to give a shout out to Jeff Dodge. It's been a pleasure working with him over the last 10 years. Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: I'm keeping track, Jeff, but they're racking up the shout outs. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back to Trevor Burns for any additional or closing remarks. Trevor Burns - Equifax, Inc.: No. Thanks, everybody, for their time today, and I'll be consistent and give Jeff another shout out. Anybody has any follow-up questions we'll be available after the call. Thank you very much. Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: Thanks, everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC Operator : Good day and welcome to the Equifax Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. This conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Trevor Burns. Please go ahead. Trevor Burns - Equifax, Inc.: Thanks and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Trevor Burns, Investor Relations. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com. During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including fourth quarter and full-year guidance to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risk factors, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2017 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. Also, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. For the third quarter of 2018, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes, acquisition-related amortization expense, the income tax effects of stock awards recognized upon vesting or settlement and foreign currency losses from re-measuring the Argentinian peso denominated net monetary assets. Adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax also excludes legal and professional fees related to the cybersecurity incidents, principally fees related to our outstanding litigation and government investigations as well as the incremental non-recurring project cost designed to enhance technology and data security. This includes projects to implement systems and processes to enhance our technology and data security infrastructure, as well as our projects to replace and substantially consolidate our global networks and systems, as well as the cost to manage these projects. These projects that will transform our technology infrastructure and further enhance our data security are expected to occur throughout 2018, 2019 and into 2020. Adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax also excludes the cost related to the agreement in principle to settle class action lawsuits related to reporting a civil judgments and tax claims on our credit files. We reported a charge of $18.5 million in the third quarter with an adjusted EPS impact at about $11.50 per share. Details of this agreement will also be included in our third quarter 10-Q. Adjusted EBITDA is also defined as net income attributable to Equifax adding back interest expense, net of interest income, depreciation and amortization; income tax expense; and also as the case for adjusted EPS, excluding certain one-time items including cost related to cybersecurity incident, cost related to the agreement and principle to settle class action lawsuits and foreign currency losses from re-measuring the Argentinian peso denominated net monetary assets. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our website. In the Form 10-Q, which we will disclose that future losses from litigation and regulatory investigations associated with last year's cybersecurity incident are reasonably possible, but not yet estimable at this stage in the proceedings. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark. Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: Thanks, Trevor. Good morning. We continue to make positive steps in the third quarter towards returning to a normal selling relationship with our U.S. customers, while investing heavily in technology, security and customer support and transformational investments. Our significant multiyear investments in technology and data security are critical to our long-term success and will differentiate Equifax in the future. Our financial performance in the quarter was solid as we delivered adjusted EPS of $1.41 per share which is at the midpoint of our range. Revenue for the quarter of $834 million reflects local currency revenue growth of 2%, which was consistent with the second quarter, but below our expectations and yours for revenue growth in the quarter. In excess of a-third of this revenue growth versus our expectation reflects the weaker-than-expected U.S. mortgage market as well as weaker credit markets in Australia and the well-known economic conditions in Argentina. Importantly for us in the quarter, USIS posted positive revenue growth for the first time since the cybersecurity incident despite the weakness in the U.S. mortgage market. And equally important EWS growth approached to strong 9%, a really strong performance by both businesses as they continue to focus on the future. Currency continues to be substantial headwind for our business, negatively impacting revenue by over 200 basis points and adjusted EPS by approximately $0.04 a share versus third quarter 2017. Versus our expectations for the third quarter, currency negatively impacted revenue by about 50 basis points or $4 million and adjusted EPS by over $0.05. USIS revenue was up slightly versus last year compared to the down 1% to 2% we saw in the last three quarters. This is a solid performance in a very positive step forward for our U.S. business as we work towards returning to a more normal growth mode with our customers. We also saw growth in online information services, which was also up 1% versus last year. These are both really important milestones for us, which were achieved despite the mortgage market headwind, where inquiries were down over 10% in the quarter, which negatively impacted overall U.S. revenue by 3%. So that positive performance with that headwind was a real positive for us. While we show this momentum in sequential improvement the USIS revenue, the performance was below what we expected and John will provide some more details on that later in the discussion. In the third quarter, the vast majority of our commercial relationships in the United States returned to more normal growth mode, which is allowing us to return to working collaboratively with our customers to pursue expanded and new solutions that will drive their business forward and create revenue opportunities for Equifax. We have now a very small handful and I would say less than one hand of customers where we're still completing security reviews to address any remaining open items from the cybersecurity incident in 2017. Our sales teams are successfully re-engaging and our pipelines are building in the U.S. However, as expected and as we discussed previously, sales cycles are extended and can be unpredictable. Sales cycles historically have range from 6 months and can be as long as 12 months including customer integration. And as we discussed last quarter and prior quarters, these impacts on the sales cycles are having an impact on the pace of USIS' return to a more normal growth mode particularly in Financial Marketing Services. It will beat sales cycle impacts in the third quarter resulted in a 2% decline in Financial Marketing Services, which was weaker than our expectations as we had forecasted growth by that team. Like in the third quarter, we saw a handful of contracts in that space that closed or are closing in October versus September, which is a reflection of the pace of this recovery and also the unpredictability of the business as we work through that recovery. As in the third quarter, I'm continuing to spend a significant amount of my time with Paulino and his USIS team working with their customers as we return USIS to a more normal mode of commercial activity. I met with over 30 U.S. customers in the last 90 days and will continue to spend a large portion of my time with our customers as we continue to return to a more normal growth mode. I was with a big customer in Texas last Friday and another big customer this week on Monday and our customers' perspectives are consistent and invaluable. They value our differentiated assets in the United States, they are supportive of our significant investments in technology and data security and they're ready to return and are returning to a more normal growth mode with us. Our customers want to help them grow and they want to take advantage of our differentiated assets and insights. Our pipelines of new deals continue to build in the United States and are at their highest level in the past two years. Paulino and his team are aggressive and focused on driving growth, and we expect to see continued progress by USIS in the fourth quarter and in 2019. Workforce Solutions had a very, very strong quarter with revenue up almost 9%. Importantly, verifications was up a strong 11%. Mortgage revenue was impacted by a 10% decline and this business also in the overall mortgage impact \u2013 mortgage market which negatively impacted their revenue growth by about 3 percentage points. So excluding the mortgage impact, you can see the strong growth that the Workforce Solutions team has outside of mortgage in the third quarter in other verticals and other markets as they expand their valuable assets. Verifier revenue growth was broad-based with double-digit growth, across government talent solutions, auto, healthcare and cards reflecting their focus on expanding in the key strategic verticals. Strong government growth at both the federal and state level was driven by demand for existing services and ramping of new products into that space. For example, several states are ramping a new eligibility product that bundles Workforce Solutions in USIS data that will benefit both businesses going forward. Workforce Solutions has also benefited from strong double-digit growth in the FinTech space. While it's a smaller space for them today it's a growing vertical. FinTechs are looking to streamline online lending processes and simultaneously expand access to credit by leveraging our unique verified income and employment data to further differentiate their risk within subprime and near-prime lending segments. These type of applications are a win-win for lenders and consumers, where lenders are able to further expand loan originations with sub and near-prime customer segments without taking on additional risk and a greater number of consumers are granted access to that credit. In addition to the vertical strategy, the overall demand for The Work Number continues to grow as more verifiers establish automated system-to-system integrations that further embed our data deeply in their customer workflows and decisioning process. It also expands our relationships in FinTech that will benefit our renewed focus by USIS in this space. The Work Number record growth was also strong. The team continues to execute on its strategy to identify or acquire new data contributors by targeting market through direct and partner channels. Through September, Workforce Solutions has added over 7,000 new employer contributors to The Work Number database and the vast majority of these to our partner channel program. We expect Workforce Solutions focused on growing their database of work numbers to continue in the fourth quarter and into 2019. And as you all know this is a very important asset as that database grows. Further, as we expected Employer Services return to revenue growth increasing 3% in the quarter, this was principally driven by growth in onboarding services. With consistent strong growth in Verification Services the return to growth for Employer Services and the continued growth of their database, we expect Workforce Solutions revenue growth to further accelerate in the fourth quarter and continue strong growth in 2019. We continue to be energized about the performance of Workforce Solutions and the runway in front of them as they build-out their TWN database and expand into new verticals and use cases that will benefit from their unique employment and payroll database. Workforce Solutions is an important and strategic business to Equifax and is performing exceptionally well. International had a good quarter with local currency revenue growth of 5%. Revenue growth was down from the 8% delivered in the first half of 2018 and our expectations principally reflecting the current economic situation in Argentina that's well-known and a weakening credit market in Australia. We continue to see very strong performance across many of our international properties. Our Canadian business grew double-digits in local currency again in the third quarter which was a terrific performance. Our Asia Pacific businesses despite the weakening economy had a strong quarter and our European credit business and our Latin American businesses all grew high single-digits in local currency. As we discussed last quarter, our European debt management business is experiencing declines specifically in our venture with the UK government, which is partially offsetting the strength we're seeing across the rest of the International businesses. We expect the debt management business to return to growth in the fourth quarter and continue that performance as we move into 2019. As John will discuss further, currency negatively impacted the international revenue \u2013 our International business by $18 million on the top-line or almost 8% in the third quarter and with a larger negative impact in the third quarter than we expected. Our UK credit business which continues to deliver solid revenue growth is also delivering innovative products and partnerships to leverage future growth with UK open banking and open data relationships. Our UK business partnered with a third-party to provide a large UK financial institution an affordability referral application based on the gateway decisioning and API capabilities of our new InterConnect platform. This application uses bank account information sourced through open banking to enable bank underwriters to view an applicant's bank statement, access affordability and verify their income. This streamlined customer journey reduces the application process length, improves customer service, reduces application fatigue and drop-offs and leads to more effective lending decisions for our partners, while adhering to the highest regulatory standards on an affordability assessment. This solution is believed to be the first example of open banking \u2013 or we believe this to be the first solution of open banking being used on a credit application customer journey in the UK. I'm excited about our International business and the collaborative innovation we are seeing from their global franchises. We expect continued strong performance from that team in the future. Global Consumer Solutions revenue declined 12% on a reported and local currency basis in the third quarter. This was a little bit better than our expectations. As expected and as a result of our suspension of U.S. consumer advertising last fall, the U.S. consumer direct business revenue declined over 30% in the third quarter. Our U.S. consumer direct business now represents just over 30% of GCS and our total consumer direct business including Canada and the UK represents slightly less than half of GCS revenue. Our partner businesses, which are strategically important, which are sales through direct-to-consumer partner in benefits channels, represent slightly more than half of our revenue and were up double-digit in the third quarter. This growth was broad-based, fueled by growth from existing direct-to-consumer partners and the addition of new smaller partners and growth in our benefits channel. As we discussed in our last call, the U.S. Senate passed legislation earlier in the year requiring credit bureaus to provide free services to consumers including free credit freezes. We fully supported the provisions of this legislation and our team successfully implemented these new services in September. Free credit freezes are now available via our website at www.equifax.com. In September, we reopened the digital sales in our U.S. direct channel and GCS and began limited direct marketing to U.S. consumers in October. Initially, our level of marketing investment will be low as we test the market and we do not expect meaningful revenue growth in the fourth quarter from these marketing investments, but do expect to see positive revenue growth in 2019 from GCS on the direct-to-consumer side. We believe retaining a direct relationship with consumers will be important to our commitment to substantially strengthen our customer support, as well as to our direct-to-consumer partner NPI efforts. Turning now to our technology transformation. It's an important priority for us, which includes our actions to deliver on our commitment to become a leader in data security and our consumer support commitments. And these continue forward at a rapid pace. Our new CTO, Bryson Koehler has been on the ground for three months and has hit the ground running. He's actively shaping our multiyear technology plan to bring our technology to market-leading and cloud capabilities. When fully implemented, this technology transformation is fundamental to not only our security and consumer support commitments, but also to delivering revenue acceleration and margin enhancement across Equifax. We expect our multiyear technology investments to transform and differentiate Equifax in the marketplace. We made strong steps forward in the third quarter and will accelerate those efforts in the fourth quarter and into 2019. In the fourth quarter, we'll continue implementation of our global data gateway decisioning and API framework applications that together we call InterConnect, following our virtual private cloud approach in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Latin America, Asia, including Australia and India. We'll also complete in the fourth quarter the implementation of our Ignite Direct in the virtual private cloud in a public cloud environment in Europe, in Latin America and Australia and new deployments of Ignite Direct in the U.S. and Canada following in the first quarter. Existing U.S. and Canadian clients will be migrated to Ignite Direct throughout 2019. Ignite's marketplace will be deployed for all regions by the end of 2018 and will be a cloud native by the middle of 2019. As you know, Ignite is a market-leading decisioning tool that allows customers to easily access Equifax's differentiated data, third-party data and their own data for modeling and decisioning. We're also making great progress in integrating through Ignite and InterConnect our ability to manage attributes and models including those driven by machine learning from investigation to production. We expect to have implemented a seamless integrated process for a major U.S. customer in the fourth quarter and are working to make this broadly available by the end of the first quarter 2019. These investments and transitions will simplify and accelerate our consolidation of legacy platforms into modern cloud-based systems and substantially ease the ability of our customers to implement, access and utilize these applications and access our differentiated data. The broader transformation of our architecture to a standard and consistent data fabric for data ingestion, governance, enrichment and management is also progressing well and we'll provide you more detail on our broader technology plan as a part of our fourth quarter earnings discussion in early 2019. All of these actions are being executed consistent with our commitment to be a leader in technology and data security. Separately in the third quarter, we also informed eligible users of our free TrustedID Premier service that we are proactively extending that free service for an additional year. The product includes a suite of credit monitoring and identity theft protection services. This proactive free product extension by Equifax is consistent with our ongoing commitment to consumers following last year's cybersecurity incident and is consistent with our commitment to be a leader in consumer support regarding personal credit information. The costs associated with the acceleration of our technology transformation as well as the extension of the free credit and identity theft monitoring services are included in the one-time costs incurred in the third quarter and I'll give an update on that a little bit later as will John. New product innovation continues to be a key priority for Equifax and a real Equifax strength. We have an active pipeline of new product innovation with over 100 new products at various stages in our funnel and are tracking to launch over 50 new products this year which is consistent with both 2016 and 2017 pace. This growing pipeline of new products will be valuable in all of our markets, but particularly in the U.S. as they work back to a more normal growth mode. As with all years, success in delivering NPI revenue in 2018 and 2019 will be heavily based on sales of products launched in 2017 and 2016. We are focused on protecting the technology, product management and marketing resources that work on NPI to ensure we keep that pipeline building and focused on bringing new products to market. USIS is seeing an immediate success with several 2018 new products, including commercial trended data scores and also our identity validation products protecting against synthetic IDs in both batch and online environments. Workforce Solutions working collaboratively with our USIS business is seeing success in extending Equifax identity validation products using the unique data maintained in the Workforce database through The Work Number and selected Employer Services applications. These solutions are utilized by government customers as well as providing opportunities for our commercial customers. International has seen consistent strong execution in NPI throughout 2018, particularly the installation of new Ignite solutions across our major geographies. The International team is also developing a number of new data exchanges for industries such as telco, utility, insurance, which will enrich the solutions that we can offer through our global Ignite platforms. These new data exchanges are important long-term best by the business for the future in the markets that they're housed. The addition of new data assets is integral to our strategy and provides long-term growth in those markets. These are in addition to the successes we are seeing in the UK integrating Equifax data with customer data through the new open data and banking \u2013 through the new open data and open banking initiative to deliver new solutions to customers. Further, our GCS business through last year's acquisition of ID Watchdog is developing new financial wellness solutions for the benefits channel market. All of our business units are benefiting from the technology transformation, specifically the deployment of Ignite and its integration with InterConnect. We are focused on making it easier for our customers to utilize Ignite both by increasing the D&A resources to working directly with customers and by implementing it in a virtual private cloud for easier access by our customers. Getting our industry-leading Ignite platform and many of our experts in data science in the hands and working directly with our customers is an area of personal focus for me and Equifax more broadly. I'm confident this will accelerate NPI for Equifax as we finish the year and move into 2019. We're also making some structural changes within Equifax, focusing on driving more of our resources and decision-making closer to customers. Over time, this will make us more responsive and reduce our overhead costs. We started making these changes in August with an organizational realignment of resources and decision-making closer to our market and customers and aligning those resources directly in our business units. We expect this to continue during the fourth quarter as we take a hard look at optimizing our G&A and headquarters cost structure across the business. M&A remains an important avenue growth for Equifax. We have a solid pipeline of opportunities and have completed several small bolt-on acquisitions in 2018 supporting USIS, Workforce Solutions and International, including our acquisition of DataX that we announced in July. In the third quarter, we also acquired an additional 10% ownership interest in our Indian joint venture bringing our overall ownership interest of 59%. We continue to see India as a long-term growth market for Equifax. While M&A is core to our long-term strategy, we believe partner opportunities are also another avenue to deliver revenue growth. We recently entered into an important strategic partnership agreement with Yodlee, a financial data aggregation and data analytics platform provider to help simplify the mortgage loan process by making it easier for lenders to drive insights from borrower's financial data. This collaboration provides Equifax with access to real-time asset expense and other information on prospective customers, who have granted permission and have streamlined a loan evaluation and production process for our customers, reduce broad exposure in the application process, get banks loan originators and lenders additional tools to assess risks and underwriting and portfolio management in the mortgage space. As Trevor mentioned in his opening comments, our 10-Q will provide disclosure on the status of our litigation and regulatory and other investigations related to this 2017 cybersecurity incident, as well as other matters in which Equifax has involved. We continue to be responsive and work with all parties involved to address these matters in a timely and reasonable matter and we expect our discussion to continue to move forward positively in the fourth quarter and into early 2019. I want to reiterate to consumers and to our customers of my absolute and Equifax's absolute commitment to protecting the sensitive consumer and customer data with which we've been entrusted, and to make Equifax a leader in data security and technology, while enhancing our customer support to make it the most friendly \u2013 consumer-friendly credit bureau. We made strong progress on these priorities over the last year and are committed to continuing to invest resources in people towards achieving these goals. In summary, over the first nine months of 2018, Equifax has made strong progress on our strategic and tactical goals as we move past the cybersecurity incident in 2017 and move back to a more normal growth mode. We are confident we are moving in the right direction and that we have \u2013 and our momentum is accelerating as we approach the end of 2018 and Workforce to 2019. We made important steps in the third quarter as we move back to a more normal growth mode in USIS and we expect this progress to continue as we move into fourth quarter in 2019. We're investing at record levels to make Equifax a market leader in data analytics technology and security and we're excited about our future and the opportunities that's ahead. While our overall third quarter performance was below your expectations and ours, we delivered strong topline growth in Workforce Solutions, clear revenue performance in USIS and continued good performance in International. However, the level of improvement was less than we expected. Despite this, we delivered on our EPS commitment. Before I turn it over to John, let me provide some further perspective on 2018 and how we're thinking about 2019. Looking at 2018, our largest BUs \u2013 the three Bus; USIS, Workforce Solutions and International, if you exclude GCS comprised 90% of Equifax revenue and delivered 4% local currency growth an improvement from first half and we're pleased with this performance. Looking forward into 2019, we believe that we will see improved growth from each of our business units for the following reasons. First, we're confident that USIS is on a path back to growth. USIS is online business grew in the third quarter for the first time since the cybersecurity incident, despite a weaker-than-expected mortgage market. This is a really important milestone for us and step forward. While we've seen increased competitive pressures in USIS in the past 12 months, we've retained and extended key relationships our new deal pipelines are building strongly and as I mentioned earlier at the highest levels they've been in the last two years and we have a growing pipeline of new and innovative products to deliver to our U.S. customers. We feel good about the U.S. progress in the fourth quarter. And as we look forward to 2019 as they work back to a more normal growth mode. Our Workforce Solutions business is performing extremely well and has very strong fundamentals. The Verification business continues to grow its database strongly. We're penetrating existing and new verticals and expanding product offerings, which will provide strong double-digit growth. Employer Services returned to growth in the third quarter fueled by Employer Services. As we discussed earlier, we expect Workforce Solutions to have a strong fourth quarter and continue strong growth in 2019. This is an important and strategic business for Equifax. Third, our International business has leadership positions in strategic global markets that enables us to bring new products and data access to markets. We expect the UK debt management business to return to growth in the fourth quarter and substantially improve in 2019 along with solid growth from our other International businesses. And last, we all know that GCS was impacted significantly in the second half of this year by the lack of marketing over the past 12 months. We've restarted marketing in October in online sales and we're seeing continued growth in our indirect channel. These actions will result in significant improvement in GCS in 2019 and allow the business to move towards revenue growth in the second half of 2019. These dynamics of USIS returning to growth, the strong fundamentals of Workforce Solutions, International growth and the removal of the drag from GCS as they move back to a growth mode should allow for improved revenue growth as we move into and through 2019. This high-margin incremental revenue growth combined with our focus in the fourth quarter on cost efficiencies following our resource realignment in August should also positively impact our margins as we move into 2019. Last, John will give you an update on our Sierra technology and security spend during his comments. Our 2018 spend is now forecasted $350 million, which is up $50 million from our prior forecast as we continue our security efforts and accelerate our technology refresh and cloud efforts. We expect our spend to be significant again in 2019, but below this run rate. We continue to be energized about the future for Equifax and the investments we are making in the future. With that, let me turn it over to John. John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.: Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I will generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis, but will refer to non-GAAP results as well. For 2018, additional items excluded from our non-GAAP results are acquisition-related amortization expense, the one-time costs related to the cybersecurity incident, charges associated with an agreement in principles to settle class action lawsuits not associated with last year cybersecurity incident, income tax effects of stock awards that are recognized upon vesting our settlement, the foreign currency losses from re-measuring the Argentinian peso denominated net monetary assets. We have provided the details on these items, so you can consider them in your analysis. In total, in 3Q, 2018 we incurred total non-recurring costs of $136 million. The non-recurring charges are excluded from adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Included in these non-recurring costs were : non-recurring costs related to the cybersecurity incident of $117 million; $117 million of gross cost includes $16 million were generally for legal fees and other professional services principally related to outstanding litigation and government investigations related to the cybersecurity incident, $93 million were generally for one-time incremental project and other costs incurred to implement our data security and technology plan and improve our technology infrastructure and $8 million in accrued and incurred gross expenses related to the TID Premier service we offered free to all U.S. citizens. As Mark indicated, we are expanding credit monitoring and identity protection services to eligible members for an additional year. Total non-recurring and one-time incremental project and other gross costs incurred year-to-date related to our technology and data security initiatives are $267 million, and since 3Q 2017 related to the cybersecurity incident are $431 million. We have $125 million of cybersecurity insurance under our ENL (33:12) policy against which we have received payments to-date of $95 million. While we did not record any recoveries in the third quarter, we continue to expect to make claims that fully utilize the policy. The one-time incremental project cost for implementing data security and technology of $93 million in 3Q 2018 are up from 2Q 2018 and higher than the guidance we provided in July. As Mark indicated earlier, our actions to substantially consolidate and transition our technology infrastructure, applications and data environments including aggressively moving to a virtual private cloud are accelerating rapidly. In the second half of 2018 and early 2019, this is resulting in us incurring increased project costs to make needed investments in existing infrastructure as well as investing to build new infrastructure and consolidated applications in data platforms and begin the journey to migrate our global customers to this new infrastructure. We view the higher costs we're incurring over this period as short-term in nature. I'll provide more detail on our outlook for these costs later in the presentation. In addition to the non-recurring costs related to the cybersecurity incident, we expensed $90 million related to an agreement in principle to settle class action lawsuits related to the reporting of civil judgments and tax liens on consumer credit files. For Equifax, in 3Q 2018 as Mark indicated revenue of $834 million is up 2% on a local currency basis and flat on a reported basis for 3Q 2017 and below the local currency expectation we discussed in July. At the time of our conference call in July, our expectation was for local currency growth of over 4% with reported growth of over 2%. Actual FX impact in the third quarter was negative $18 million or 220 basis points and was more negative than expected by approximately 50 basis points or $4 million. This larger-than-expected impact was principally in our Argentina and Australia markets. Local currency growth was less than expected by over 200 basis points. This weaker-than-expected performance was in USIS, International and also Workforce Solutions, market factors represented over a-third of this impact as USIS and Workforce were impacted by weaker U.S. mortgage market inquiries and International was impacted by weakening credit dynamics in Australia and the weaker current situation in Argentina. I will provide details during my discussion of each view that follows. Adjusted EPS in the third quarter was $1.41 per share, reflecting weaker-than-expected FX in the quarter adjusted EPS would have been $1.42 per share above the midpoint of the $1.39 to $1.44 guidance we provided in July. Although our adjusted EPS came in as expected, this composition was different. The lower-than-expected revenue resulted in lower EBITDA dollars and margin percentage offsetting this was lower-than-expected corporate expense and a lower tax rate, as we will discuss later a portion of the lower tax rate we expect to continue. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 33% in 3Q 2018 down 440 basis points from 3Q 2017. Just over half of the reduction in adjusted EBITDA compared to the third quarter of 2017 increased corporate costs, principally increased cost and security and related technology, our transformation and risk office, the cost of supporting Lock & Alert as well as increased insurance cost. These increases are consistent with what we described in our original guidance for 2018. Corporate costs in 3Q 2018 are also reflecting increased variable compensation accruals relative to 2017. In 2017, following the cybersecurity incident, our incentive comp was eliminated for members of the senior leadership team and significantly reduced across the company. The remaining just under half of the decline was principally in USIS and International, which I will cover in more detail shortly. USIS revenue in 3Q 2018 was $308 million up slightly compared to the third quarter of 2017 and importantly our first quarter of revenue growth since the cybersecurity incident. USIS delivered growth, despite a decline in the overall mortgage market inquiries of about 10%, which impacted USIS revenue growth negatively by over $9 million or 3%. In the quarter, DataX \u2013 after DataX acquisition benefited revenue by about 1%. Mortgage Solutions and total USIS mortgage revenue related revenue were up 1%. Total mortgage-related revenue for Equifax including Workforce Solutions mortgage revenue was up 2%. Overall mortgage market inquiries declined by 10% more than a high single-digit decline we had expected. Equifax total mortgage revenue benefited from the launch of trended complete tribunal report in 1Q 2018. In 4Q 2018, we expect mortgage market inquires to be down over 10% higher than our estimate from July and down high single-digits for the full-year. Online Information Solutions revenue was $222 million, up 1% when compared to the year-ago period. Again, this growth was achieved despite the negative impact of the mortgage market of about 3%. We saw growth in both consumer online and commercial online revenues in the quarter. This is the first quarter of commercial revenue growth since transitioning to the CFN, reflecting the progress we are making in delivering new solutions to our commercial customers including commercial trended data. Financial Marketing Services revenue was $47 million in 3Q 2018, down 2% or $1 million compared to 3Q 2017. The decline in Financial Marketing Services as Mark indicated is principally due to delays and longer cycle times on closing new batch opportunities. We continue to see the strengthening of our sales pipeline in USIS overall and our Financial Marketing Services. We expect to see that reflected in revenue performance as we move forward in 2019. As I indicated earlier, USIS revenue growth was lower than we had expected in 3Q. Approximately a third of the lower USIS growth was driven by weaker-than-expected overall U.S. mortgage market. The weaker mortgage market and to a lesser extent some weaker auto online volume resulted in OIS revenue being up only 1%. Financial Marketing Services was also weaker-than-expected principally due to delay than longer cycle times and closing new batch opportunities as was indicated earlier. The adjusted EBITDA margin for USIS was 46.2% down 300 basis points from last year. Year-to-year USIS margins in 3Q 2018 were principally impacted by the following factors : increased third-party costs principally in mortgage and increased security-related and other technology costs. We expect USIS 4Q 2018 revenue to be up versus 4Q 2017 and for calendar year 2018 revenue to be flat to down 1% from 2017. For 4Q 2018, we expect USIS EBITDA margins to improve sequentially. Workforce Solutions revenue was $202 million in the quarter, up 9% when compared to 3Q 2017. Verification Services revenue of $144 million is up 11%, driven by strong double-digit percentage growth across government, auto, card, health care and talent solutions. Mortgage was lower than our expectations due to the weakening overall mortgage market. This weaker mortgage market as well as some offline revenue that did not close in the quarter as expected, drove the bulk of the somewhat lower performance at Workforce against our expectations when the quarter began. Importantly, we also grew both active and total reference again in 3Q 2018. Employer Services revenue of $58 million is up 3% in line with our expectations and better than the down 3% and down 9% we saw in 1Q and 2Q. As Mark indicated earlier, the increase was principally in our I-9 and onboarding businesses. The Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margin was 47.5% in 3Q 2018 down 110 basis points from 3Q 2017. This decline was driven by increased production cost reflecting initiatives across our infrastructure and also increased cost of security. Given the positive revenue mix driven by strong growth in Verification Services that we expect to continue in 4Q 2018, we expect to see sequential improvement in Workforce margins. For the full-year, we continue to expect Workforce Solutions' adjusted EBITDA margins to be down slightly versus 2017. International revenue was $235 million in 3Q 2018, down 2% on a reported basis and up 5% on a local currency basis. Asia Pacific revenue was $81 million, down 1% in U.S. dollars and up 7% in local currency. Growth is down from the 10% plus growth seen in the first half of 2018, consistent with the weakening we are seeing in consumer, particularly mortgage and other consumer credit markets in Australia. We continue to see nice growth in commercial. Europe's revenue was $68 million in 3Q 2018, down 1% in U.S. dollars and flat in local currency. We continue to see high single-digit local currency growth in our European credit operations. This was offset by a local currency revenue decline in our debt management business specifically in our venture with the UK government. As Mark mentioned earlier, we expect to see improved performance in the debt management business and a return to growth in the fourth quarter. Latin America's revenue was $49 million in 3Q 2018, down 11% in U.S. dollars and up 7% in local currency. Revenue growth was weaker than the almost 15% growth we delivered in the first half of 2018, principally due to slower growth in Argentina which reflects the current economic situation there and slower growth in Chile which we believe is timing and we expect to see recover in fourth quarter. Similar to the first half of 2018, we continue to see good growth across Ecuador, Mexico, Uruguay and Paraguay. Canada's revenue was $37 million, up 6% in U.S. dollars and up 11% in local currency. This was another great quarter for Canada, even stronger than the approximately 8% local currency growth they saw in the first half of 2018. Canada's growth was broad-based including strong double-digit growth across decisions, solutions and analytical services. Investments in technology, including Ignite as well as a focus on customer innovation have resulted in strong growth with new FI and FinTech customers in volumes and fraud products. International's adjusted EBITDA margin was 29.4% in 3Q 2018, down 380 basis points from 3Q 2017. The year-over-year decline reflects increased investment in sales generation as well as the expected increased spend in security and technology. We expect EBITDA margins to increase in 4Q 2018 as compared to 3Q 2018. Global Consumer Solutions revenue was $89 million in 3Q 2018, down 12% on a reported and local currency basis. As Mark covered, our total consumer direct business comprising the U.S., UK and Canada represents just over half of GCS revenue. U.S. consumer direct revenue, which now represents just over 30% of GCS revenue in total, declined significantly in the quarter as we had suspended advertising and online sales in September of 2017. We restarted U.S. online sales late in 3Q 2018 and have begun limited digital marketing earlier this month. As Mark indicated, we do not expect this to benefit subscriber levels until 2019. Our UK consumer direct business is down due to price reductions related to GDPR but we have seen nice growth in subscribers which is positive as we move into 2019. Our partner-based businesses, which now represent over half of GCS revenue, grew nicely in the quarter and offset a portion of this decline. We saw a nice growth both with existing customers and added several smaller customers in the quarter. ID Watchdog, the business Equifax acquired in 3Q 2018 that provides consumer credit and identity services through the employer benefits channel has been performing very well. We continue to see growth that we believe should accelerate in 2019 and 2020. We also believe this business has opportunities to expand into Canada, the UK and Australia. GCS adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.3% in 3Q 2018, up 40 basis points from 3Q 2017. The net decline in revenue and related gross margin was more than offset by lower marketing expense in our U.S. consumer direct business and other admin costs. In 4Q 2018, we expect a further sequential revenue decline reflecting a further decline in the U.S. consumer direct business and a resulting sequential reduction in EBITDA margins. 4Q 2018 EBITDA margins are expected to decline relative to 3Q 2018, reflecting both the lower U.S. consumer direct revenue and an increase in marketing expense as we restart U.S. consumer marketing. In the third quarter, general corporate expense was $140 million. Excluding the non-recurring costs associated with the cybersecurity incident, the adjusted general corporate expense for the quarter was $68 million, up $22 million from 3Q 2017. The increase reflects two main factors. First, the increased ongoing costs related to security and related technology, the free Lock & Alert product, our transformation and risk office and increased insurance costs. These increases are consistent with what we described in our original guidance for 2018. Second, as I indicated earlier, corporate costs in 3Q 2018 are also reflecting increased variable compensation accruals relative to 2017. In 2017, following the cybersecurity incident, our incentive comp was eliminated for members of the senior leadership team and significantly reduced across the company. For 3Q 2018, the effective tax rate used in calculating adjusted EPS was approximately 19%. In our 3Q 2018 guidance in July, we indicated that we expected our 3Q 2018 effective tax rate used for adjusted EPS to be lower than the 23.5% we had incurred in the second quarter. The 19% we incurred was slightly better than we had expected, reflecting both a reduction in our ongoing effective tax rate to 25% from the slightly higher rate incurred in 2Q 2018. In 3Q 2018, we had the benefit of this lower expected ongoing rate as well as the year-to-date catch-up. This lower rate will benefit us in 4Q 2018 and 2019. And we had discrete benefits in the quarter principally related to the annual return to accrual true-up. The difference between our GAAP effective tax rate and the effective tax rate used in calculating adjusted EPS reflects adjustments for costs associated with our cybersecurity incident, litigation settlements not associated with the cybersecurity incident, the income tax effect of stock awards and foreign currency losses for re-measuring the Argentinian peso denominated net monetary assets. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables which are included in our earnings release. For 2018, we now expect our full-year effective tax rate including discrete items to be about 23.5% with 4Q 2018 slightly better than that level. In 3Q 2018, operating cash flow was $153 million and free cash flow was $63 million. They're both down from 3Q 2017 principally reflecting the cash costs of our investments in security and technology and ongoing legal costs related to the cybersecurity incident. We also did not have any insurance cash collections in the quarter. As we indicated earlier, we expect to fully claim on $125 million of cybersecurity insurance. To-date, we have collected $95 million in insurance with $80 million received in the first half of 2018. Through September, operating cash flow was $507 million and free cash flow was $299 million, down 17% and 34% respectively. Capital spending incurred in the quarter was $102 million and year-to-date was $250 million. Year-to-date capital spending is approximately 10% of revenues, slightly higher than we had expected at the beginning of 2018. For all of 2018, we expect capital spending to be about 10% of revenue. Similar to our discussion related to project cost for security and technology transformation as we accelerate our progress in building new cloud-based infrastructure and then migrating existing applications to this new infrastructure, we're seeing higher project and therefore higher capital spending. Total net debt at the end of 3Q 2018 was $2.4 billion. In September, we entered into a $1.1 billion 5-year revolving credit agreement that replaced our $900 million revolving credit agreement that was scheduled to mature in November 2020. This new agreement is structured to allow flexibility over the next several years as we transform our security and technology infrastructure. We have now refinanced all near-term debt and credit facilities. Now turning to our guidance for 4Q 2018. We are expecting local currency growth of 2% to 4% in 4Q 2018 as compared to 4Q 2017. At current exchange rates, FX is a negative 2.5% impact on revenue growth in 4Q 2018. This results in reported growth of down 0.5% to up 1.5% in 4Q 2018, while revenue between $835 million and $850 million. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.30 and $1.35 per share. Versus 4Q 2017, FX is expected to negatively impact adjusted EPS by about $0.04 per share. Our 4Q 2018 adjusted EPS guidance is down at the midpoint of our range and on an FX-adjusted basis by $0.03 from the 4Q 2017 adjusted EPS of $1.39. This decline is principally impacted by increased corporate expense of about $0.12 to $0.15. This increase is driven by two main factors. First, costs for security and related technology, the free Lock & Alert service, our transformation and risk office and increased insurance costs and increased variable compensation accruals relative to 2017, and also higher interest expense in 4Q 2018 of approximately $0.03 a share. These negative factors were partially offset by higher operating profit at USIS, Workforce and International partially offset by a reduction at GCS and a lower tax rate in 4Q 2018 as compared to prior year due to the 2017 Tax Act. For perspective, since we provided our July guidance, FX has negatively impacted revenue by $4 million, $8 million and $12 million in 3Q 2018, 4Q 2018 and calendar year 2018 respectively. Adjusted EPS has been negatively impacted by $0.005 per share, $0.01 per share and $0.015 per share in 3Q 2018, 4Q 2018 and calendar 2018 respectively. Looking at our guidance for calendar year 2018, we now expect revenue to increase on a local currency basis by 2.2% to 2.7%. At FX, at current rates is approximately 0.75% negative to revenue. This results in calendar year 2018 reported revenue guidance of $3.412 billion to $3.427 billion. Adjusted EPS guidance is $5.70 to $5.75 per share. FX is negative impact of $0.10 per share. We expect in 2018 to incur in excess of $350 million of gross incremental cost for investments in technology and data security projects, and legal and professional fees being incurred just specifically to address litigation claims and governmental and regulatory investigations related to the cybersecurity incident. We continue \u2013 net costs after insurance proceeds are still expected to be approximately $275 million although timing of insurance receipts is difficult to forecast. Investments in technology and data security are expected to represent over 80% of the gross cost of \u2013 in excess of $350 million. These costs are being excluded from our non-GAAP financial results and guidance. In 4Q 2018, we expect gross cost to be lower than what we incurred in 3Q 2018. These estimates do not include any estimates of damages, fines or other amounts that may result from the resolution of litigation and regulatory investigations related to the cybersecurity incident. This represents an increase of over $75 million in gross cost from the original estimate of these gross costs that we provided in March. The increase is principally in technology investment and is occurring in the second half of 2018. As was indicated earlier, as we begin the phase of building our new infrastructure based on our virtual private cloud approach and our transition of our applications of this new infrastructure we believe we are in a bubble period where we're incurring costs related to the needed investments in our existing infrastructure at the same time that we are moving to the new. We are excited by this progress as we begin to more rapidly migrate applications to our future leading technology. These higher costs that I referenced are expected to be incurred in the second half of 2018 and early 2019. Beyond that, we will see a substantial reduction in technology in this year's spend. We will provide much more detail on our technology plans in our 4Q 2018 conference call early next year. As Mark indicated earlier, we remain focused on delivering to our commitments in data security and consumer support. Over the past year, Equifax has made tremendous progress in delivering on the commitments made last year and moving our commercial relationships back to delivering new solutions for customers and opportunities to grow Equifax. However as expected, at times the progress is choppy, but we firmly believe the pace of change is accelerating and we are looking forward to the progress we will deliver in 2019. And with that, we'll open it up for questions. Operator : We will take the first question from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about USIS growth. You know, I know it was flat this quarter \u2013 first quarter positive post the breach. Just wanted to know \u2013 you are thinking of how quickly could this business return back to pre-breach levels? And also just in terms of the \u2013 still \u2013 lower level than where it has been since the breach. How much is it just the end market versus how much is reluctance from customers still trying to get comfortable with the security? Thanks. Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: Sure, thanks Toni for the question. I'll start and John can jump in. It's hard to forecast how quickly USIS over current return to kind of pre-breach growth levels of that 6%, 7%, 8% that it was doing 18 months ago. We've been pretty clear that our recovery is positive. It's progressing. In my comments, I talked about that, you asked about that are there customers who don't want to do business with us. That's not the case. We've got less than a handful that \u2013 meaning one hand that we're still finalizing. Some of the security audits they're doing. The rest of our customers are back to more of a normal growth mode. Meaning, we're in there talking about competitive situations. We're in there talking about our NPIs. We're in there engaging around our Marketing Services business, our batch business. So, we're back to a more normal growth mode. But that recovery is hard to predict at how quickly we're going to get into that normal growth mode. We've seen progress, which we're very pleased with. I talked about our pipelines continue to build with our customers. I'm spending a lot of time with them. They want to take advantage of our differentiated data, our new products whether it's Ignite or InterConnect or differentiated data and the NC-plus database our TWN, Work Number database. Customer want our data and it's just going to be a matter of time. And we do expect continued improvement from third quarter to fourth quarter. We expect that we continue into 2019. It's just hard to predict when we'll actually get to that pre-breach growth level. But from my perspective, it's not a matter of if it's really just when and we expect that progress to continue. Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. And then just on International. On a constant currency basis, LatAm and Asia Pac came in a little bit below where both have been in the last three quarters. And so, just wanted to get a sense of \u2013 I know you mentioned Argentina and Chile for LatAm. But anything to call out that could reaccelerate or any sort of one-time-ish type issues in 3Q that sort of made those a little bit slower? John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.: Well, we talked about in our comments, right, that we thought Chile was a bit weaker in the third quarter, but we thought that was something that would recover as we got through the fourth quarter and into next year. So, Chile we do think is a short-term issue. Argentina, we'll have to see how the economy progresses. And Australia, as we indicated, we are seeing some credit tightening there. You've seen some commentary recently by government officials and the Australian banks. So, there has been a credit tightening there and that's impacting our consumer business. But overall, that business continues to grow nicely with relatively high single-digit type of growth rates and we would expect them to continue to innovate as they have. So as with all of our businesses, the ability to generate and sell new products is key to growth. And we think given the strong positions Argentina, Chile, generally in Latin America and Australia, we have that we should have the opportunity to do that as we move forward. Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And one last quick one and then I'll turn it over. Mark you mentioned in prepared remarks, you expected litigation to move forward positively in fourth quarter and into 2019. Could you just elaborate on what you meant by that? Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: I'm Sorry. I lost the first part of the positively forward in fourth quarter in 2019, which business? Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: You expected litigation to move forward positively. Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it really I was just trying to signal and actually not signal just be clear about it. We're in active dialogs with all parties involved in that. And those discussions are positive, meaning that we're engaging with them. And I'd say that they are at an accelerated pace. And we expect those to continue with that pace in the fourth quarter as we go into 2019 and are working towards resolutions to push those forward. Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's great. Thank you. Operator : We'll now take the next question from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Please go ahead. Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, this is actually Greg calling on for Manav. Just trying to square kind of the disappointment in 3Q with the positive commentary into 2019. And maybe some comments on how you're seeing the visibility of the business. I think you've talked about 6-months to 12-months sales cycle. Are you seeing those extended even further as you kind of reengage these customers post breach? And how we should think about sales cycle there? Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: Yeah, you're referring I think Greg to USIS there. As opposed to... Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes, that's correct. Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: ...my comments were more broadly \u2013 we'll talk about USIS. I think our disappointment. We were pleased with USIS' progress. While it was a bit below what we had hoped for the fact that they move forward positively versus fourth quarter, first quarter, second quarter that sequential improvement was important to us and quite meaningful. And what's behind my comments and John's about our outlook for, as we go forward is you go back six months ago, nine months ago, even four months ago, we had a longer list of customers that were still completing their post security incident audits. That's a very small number now. As I said less than what you count on one hand. Meaning that we'll resolve those and we're back to normal discussions. And our customers want our differentiated data. I'm spending tons of time with customers. I was with a big one on Monday, another big one last Friday. They want our differentiated data. They want our decisioning assets. So, they're engaged around getting back to growth. There is some unpredictability when you get the green light to get back in a mode of operations to be putting new products in front of them or new data assets, the unpredictability really comes about from them evaluating them, going through a purchasing process and there's a technology element of actually getting them those new products installed on their system or getting them access to our tools. We don't see any extension of the sales cycle as we try to be consistent every quarter that these are different in every situation. But with the pipelines at the highest level they've been in USIS in the last couple of years, the momentum I see in the space the way our commercial teams are engaging with customers, my involvement, Paulino's involvement that's what gives us the confidence that USIS will see continued improvement. And for your earlier question from Toni, we can't predict when we'll be back to that more normal growth mode. But we have a lot of confidence we're going to see continued improvement going forward. And as I said earlier, from our perspective, getting back to that more normal growth mode is not a matter of if, it's only timing. And we do expect to see continued improvement in fourth and then as we go into 2019. John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.: And looking at 2019, I think the commentary in general was just around \u2013 was looking at history right? I think we felt good about the fact that the three big businesses grew 4% on a local currency basis and actually improved their growth from the first half rate in the third quarter. And really a significant impact on our overall growth in the third quarter was GCS and the large decline there, which we think there's a very fairly clear path as to why that's going to substantially mitigate it again the next year. So, just based on what happened this year and what's fairly clear about GCS and the trends we're seeing, it feels like the trend is positive in terms of the type of growth rates that should occur. Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then maybe quickly on the organizational realignment. I think I heard it a couple times. Just any more color there and how you're thinking about the potential cost save opportunities from that process? Thanks. Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: Yeah. We're in the midst of that now. The alignment was made where we move to resources and reporting relationships back to the BUs and closer to the markets, which is an approach that I find makes a lot of sense to get decision-making closer to markets and customers. And we're going through a process now of a re-look at all of our cost efficiencies, as we do our budgeting for 2019 and we do expect some efficiency to come out and we'll be sharing those with you later in the year, for sure those will be quite visible as we have our discussion in January around our fourth quarter results. Operator : We will now take the next question from George Mihalos from Cowen. Please go ahead. George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Mark and John, you outlined a few factors that impacted the constant currency growth rate in 3Q going from sort of 4% to 2%. Can you just in order of magnitude break those out for us? I mean I guess mortgages is clearly the biggest that's almost a point. But, just maybe breakdown for us the different components that led to the slower growth? And has pricing with customers been a bigger impact recently than maybe a couple of quarters ago? John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.: Yeah. So I think, George, it's really what we covered in the script, right. So, I think we indicated market factors which clearly by far the biggest is mortgage. We're about a-third of it. And then the remainder of it was non-market factors. And then we gave you the specifics really by BU, as to how BUs will specifically impact us. So, I just probably just need to refer you back to those to our overall comments to give you the breakdown of where revenue came in below expectation. George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC: Was there anything sort of from a competitive angle or from a pricing angle that sort of stood out that maybe had a bit of a bigger impact than what you guys were expecting? John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.: No. No, there was nothing there on pricing competitive that was any different than our expectations in the quarter or frankly that we've seen during the year that would be different. George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Just quick follow-up. Should we expect in conjunction with the 4Q earnings, should we expect you guys to kind of talk about your long-term targets and how you're thinking about the business going from there? And then, Mark, you talked encouragingly about the trends going into 2019 both at the topline and even from a spent perspective? Should we be assuming that at least directionally margins will be up in 2019 versus what would you posted in 2018? Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: Yeah, I think it's early for us to give that kind of guidance on specific on margins. What we wanted to do is give you some visibility of things that we're working on in the fourth quarter. And you can do the math, with the revenue growth that we would hope to deliver in 2019 that should be helpful to margins. And cost actions that we're going to take and we don't have a sizing on that. Those should be positive for margins. And with the long-term growth model, we haven't made a determination yet of the timing of putting that back in place. We'll certainly give some guidance for 2019 as we get into \u2013 finish up the year. And we're still thinking through the right timing to put that framework back in place. I think we've tried to be consistent in our prior dialogs with you about the long-term guidance that we wanted to see some track record from USIS and that's building. So, I would say that, that's going in the right direction. But we wanted to see that continued growth from USIS, which we expect and that will be determined in that long-term framework. And the second one is, is that, we want to have some visibility for us and for you around our legal settlements and those are still uncertain. And as I mentioned, we're in active dialogs with a lot of the parties, but there's still lots to discuss and lots to work on there. So those are kind of the two big ones. And then the third would be around our Sierra spend, John mentioned that we've accelerated some spending in the second half of this year as Bryson's come on board and we're working through some of the rebuild and cloud initiatives, we don't have visibility yet on what this for 2019, I think we've been clear that it will be a significant number, but we wanted to give you some visibility that our expectation is it will be below the run rate that we're currently running at. But it'll still be a big number. It's going to be a multiyear effort and we try to be clear about that. I think those three points USIS, our legal settlements efforts and then our Sierra spend, getting those in a spot where we feel confident in discussing those with you would really be in front of putting our long-term framework back in place. George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Operator : We will now take the next question from Brett Huff from Stephens. Please go ahead. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Good morning, Mark, John and Trevor. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the progress on USIS. I know it was a tough mortgage quarter but the underlying seemed really \u2013 getting better. I have a question on the lower guidance and just want to make sure I understand the drivers of that. My understanding is you talked a little bit about a third of the 200 basis points, disappointment in rev growth was mortgage, maybe $4 million of ForEx and kind of the rest was the International, Australia and Argentina, as I understand it. The guide was a little bit lower than that disappointment. It's implying more pressure in the 4Q. Is the spread of kind of the headwinds in the 4Q going to be similar to maybe what we saw in the 3Q? Or is there anything else that maybe we need to be paying attention to? John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.: I think as we indicated, right, you're going to see more mortgage headwinds in the fourth quarter, as we think you're going to see the mortgage market be down more than 10%, which is greater than what we saw in the third quarter and you're going to continue to see the headwinds in Argentina, you'll continue to see the headwinds in Australia. So, I think the things generally impacting the business overall aren't substantially different. But we are expecting to continue to make, as Mark has said, good progress with USIS, continue to make good progress in EWS. And we do think there are some positives that should occur on International. Again, the debt management business, we would expect it to turn positive or at least flat in the fourth quarter as we wrap around the difficulties we had with the UK government contract which started in the fourth quarter of last year. Then also, we expect to see some better performance out of Latin America. So, net-net, we think that's what we're expecting to see as we look forward as we indicated. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Great. That's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up is just a model question. You mentioned that the tax rate was a little bit better than you expected even though you guided it to be a little bit better in the original sort of 3Q guidance. I think you said it came in at 19%. Kind of what was the delta? I mean, we tried to do some math on the tax and I don't know if our math is right, but was it a $0.10 benefit ultimately or was it less than that, can you \u2013 is there a way you can dimensionalize that for us? We just want to make sure we got our numbers right. John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.: Yeah. So, when we indicated slightly better than 23.5%, it would have only been slightly better than 23.5%. So to dimensionalize it, you can go from a number slightly under 23.5% and compare that to 2019. Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. That's great. That's what I needed. I appreciate it. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust. Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. To the extent that one of your competitors this week referred to ongoing share gains \u2013 I think some that have nothing to do with the breach and maybe some that \u2013 and I know they're hard to identify \u2013 may be related. But to the extent there are share shifts taking place in the market, Mark, can you just talk a little bit about sort of what you view as the tail on those? In other words, do some of the initiatives you highlighted in your comments, and John, in yours, start to sort of turn the tide do you think from a net share perspective at some point next year? How do I think about the tail on this? Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: Yeah. We understand it was a comment yesterday by one of our competitors in their earnings call about share gains against an unnamed competitor that had a data security breach. So, we are guessing they were talking about us. We've \u2013 as I've been clear in our comments, we clearly \u2013 their revenue growth is stronger than ours, there is no question about that, both TU and Experian, so they're executing well in the marketplace and they are taking advantage of some of the pressures Equifax had post the data security breach. We've been consistent on prior calls that this is a competitive space that was competitive before the data security breach, it was in the last year as we've moved past the data security breach and when we're in the penalty box with customers, which we were in kind of the first half of the year and the fourth quarter last year, it's hard to do new business, it's hard to do some of the marketing solutions work. We haven't seen any loss of customers. So, we're clear about that. There's always movements between primary and secondary that happen on an ongoing basis. And as I tried to mention in my comments, we've got our own pipeline of work that we're doing and those include competitive wins that we've notched on our belt, pipeline of new deals that we're working on that we've got expectation of winning and a pipeline of deals that we're working to win. So, it's a space that has always been competitive and continues. I think the sequential improvement that you saw out of USIS in the third quarter versus second and we expect that to continue going forward. When I meet with customers, they really value our differentiated data and now that their security reviews are complete, they want to re-engage around our new products and our new insights. Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Helpful. Thank you. And with regard to GCS and the return to marketing on the direct side of that business, are there going to be any changes to the product or enhancements or price adjustments that you think could influence adoption and it give you confidence that you can sort of stem the tide in that subsegment of your business? Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: Yeah. There's always work going on inside of that business as you might imagine. They're always testing new products and looking at new opportunities to offer protection products and other products to the marketplace. As you know, the biggest impact was they went dark for a year. That was intentional on our part. And when you're not doing any marketing at all \u2013 and we actually took the products off the site. Even if someone found our site, there was no products there to buy over the last 12 months. That has a significant impact on the business. And as we said, we lit up the site in October and we're doing some targeted online marketing in the fourth quarter and we expect that to accelerate. This isn't a large business for us on the direct-to-consumer business in the United States, but it's one that we want to be in and we will continue to invest either in products or in the advertising. But don't take these comments that we're like doubling down or tripling down. This is a business that we like, we want to be in. We expect it to grow in the second half of next year as we get the benefits of some of the marketing work and the online advertising work that the team is doing starting now in October and flowing into the fourth quarter and into 2019. John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.: They'll also benefit from the technology reinvestment. They get a new platform next year that we think will ease the way they launch products and the way customers can interact with us and make that substantially improve. So, they will get a benefit there in addition to the \u2013 to what Mark already referenced. Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Gary Bisbee from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Gary Bisbee - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, guys. Good morning. John, I think you have a second career if you want it as one of those people who talk so fast on drug TV commercials. That was an unbelievable pace and a lot of stuff you went through. I guess the question for you on margin. So obviously, there's a lot of these costs that you're pulling back for the tech transformation. But you also cited over the last couple of quarters some security and other costs at the segment level. Can you talk through the margin headwinds? I guess you also talked about third-party data costs being up to adjusted EBITDA, comp coming back is obvious. But what are some of the others? And what's the duration on some of those increased costs? Thank you. John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.: So I don't think I spoke about third-party data costs. But in terms of the total security cost, right, we talked about this early in the year, right, that we had thought that we would see about $0.30 a share specifically related to security, technology related to security, our risk office, our transformation activity and that we expected that to impact us in the year. And a lot of that is in corporate but a substantial amount of it is also in the businesses. So that's impacting both corporate expenses as well as business \u2013 as expenses you're seeing in the businesses and therefore impacting their margin. We also indicated in the beginning of the year that there's about $0.10 specifically related to insurance and you're seeing that in corporate. So my comments I think in the script in several places are really referencing those total costs and they just happen to show up in both corporate as well as in the businesses as the businesses continue to grow out their security infrastructure and then also invest in technology. Gary Bisbee - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Great. And then the follow-up. Just if we think longer term like three to four years from now, what will be the benefits from the tech transformation other than the security side of it, which I think is clear? And is this a help revenue and reduced cost when all is said and done? Or how do you think about the long-term benefits? Thank you. Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: Yes, it's a great question and it's one that we want to give you some more visibility about as we finalize that technology plan for 2019 and beyond. And I think you hit the nail on the head. It's clearly going to be a cost structure improvement. As we simplify our applications and our infrastructure, there should be some meaningful cost savings there. And of course the cloud should also deliver that. But we also believe there's going to be some meaningful revenue opportunities for us as we ingest data more quickly and then also bring products across \u2013 to customers and also across the globe more quickly. Today, we have to rebuild too many products when we take them from the States to Australia, Australia to Argentina et cetera. As we rebuild those products in the cloud they'll be more easily moved from one market to another. So, there's multiple layers of benefits from this that we think are going to be quite sizable. And our intent is to really differentiate ourselves from our competition with this investment in our technology infrastructure. And our goal is to share with you and the rest of the investment community, our kind of thoughts on those benefits which as you point out and we agree are multifaceted. Gary Bisbee - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, everyone. John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.: Hi, Bill. William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : So a question for you on the auto weakness. I was going to ask if you could give us some color on that similar to what you've given on mortgage in terms of what the percentage was of revenue and the impact in the quarter. I know that your portfolio tends to be weighted towards the southeast and the impact to the storms there? John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.: Yes. So, effectively the auto market what we saw was that we had expected to see a little bit of improvement in the auto market in the quarter. And we really didn't see that. So, I think the comment was relative to our expectations. And so we saw relative to our expectations lower revenue. Part of it certainly was the fact that we're heavily weighted to the southeast and there was certainly some impact from the storms that occurred. Part of it also is that we're weighted to subprime and you're seeing some more weakness in the subprime part of the auto space than you have overall. But we had expected to see a little bit of improvement and we really just didn't see that in the auto space. William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then you had called out the increased spending in the third quarter to accelerate the technology transformation. Being based in Boston, baseball is top of mind and so I wanted to ask what inning are we in, in terms of the technology transformation? When can we expect that to be complete? Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: Yeah, it's a tricky way, Bill, in trying anything. Congrats on your team there. But mine's not in it. But the tricky way to try to get some visibility of how long our spend is going to be. I don't think we can give \u2013 I would say, certainly its early innings. But I would say that we're making a lot of progress. We've really move forward. I would characterize in the second half of the year, in the third quarter, we expect that to continue in the fourth quarter particularly with our new CTO on board. We feel good about that progress going forward and we'll give you some clear visibility of which inning when that plan is complete and our expectation is that will be in January when we report our fourth quarter results. William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Well thank you very much. Operator : We'll now take the next question from Jeff Meuler from Baird. Please go ahead. Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thank you. On the improvement and online information I get that the mortgage market is tough and you're seeing an improved year-over-year trend despite that. But the year-over-year comp is also significantly easier. So, just help us understand that what's driving or that there is really improvement. Here you told about the commercial trended product, but maybe if you could talk about some new sales trends with clients or other specific products? Just help us understand that there's real improvement beyond the easier comp? John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.: So, again, as we indicated in the script, right? The positive what we saw, nice growth. We saw growth both in commercial and consumer. There was a 300 basis point headwind specifically because of the mortgage market being down 10%. And despite that we saw improved performance in both of those. And yes, there was a breach impact in 3Q 2017, but it was really heavily in Financial Marketing Services. The impact in online was much less just because of the timing of the announcement, since the announcement was in September. So, I think really what we were heartened by the fact that we saw growth across both consumer and commercial and it was in an environment where we had a substantial headwind from mortgage in the period. Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then on the guidance I get the tougher assumed mortgage market for Q4 relative to the pace of decline in Q3. But \u2013 and I know there was a variation of this question asked earlier. But I want to re-ask it, given that part of the reason for coming in below guidance this quarter was that there were some markets that got incrementally worse. So, when you talk about headwinds in Argentina and Australia are you assuming that you're going to see further deceleration in those businesses? And just maybe a comment on your thoughts on the consumer credit markets in the U.S. outside of mortgage. Are you seeing other risk factors in any of them? Thank you. John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.: So, specifically in terms of our guidance for the fourth quarter, I think we try to cover it in the script, right? The biggest market effect that we indicated affected us in the third quarter was really U.S. mortgage. And we indicated that was the largest, the most substantial by far and we are expecting further weakening there. And that's really the biggest driver in terms of a market weighted effect that impacted us in the third quarter and likely the biggest one that would impact us in the fourth quarter. Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Operator : We'll now take our next question from David Togut from Evercore ISI. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC : Thank you. Good morning. Could you expand upon your comments with respect to Australia? The Veda acquisition did well for quite a while. Clearly this is more macro-oriented. But how are you thinking about the growth outlook for your Australian business over the next year or two? Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: Yeah. So again, so when we acquired Veda, we indicated we expected it would be a business that should grow mid to high-single digits in that range. We've seen relatively good performance over 2016 and 2017 and now through 2018. We've seen nice growth in 2018. The macro effects are certainly impacting us right now. The goal is that we should be able to continue to try to drive growth across that business as we move forward and our expectation is it should deliver consistent with our long-term expectations for the business. Now obviously there can be ups and downs in any given quarter or any given year, but the trends we see in the business we think continue to be positive, we expect to be able to continue to drive some growth in Australia. As we look forward, we're hopeful about the benefits that we'll see out of comprehensive data that's now expanding there. That's something we'll take hold slowly. But again, it's something that we're expecting to provide us with some benefits as we look forward. So overall, we continue to think the Australia acquisition is a good acquisition and we would expect this to continue to see positive growth trends. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC : Just to clarify, are you saying you expect mid to high single-digit growth to continue in next year in Australia? Or you just expect to do well in 2019? Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.: I wasn't trying to make a specific comment about rate \u2013 about overall growth rates for next year. Just that as we look at the business over the long-term, we think the expectations that we had for it initially continue to be reasonable. As we \u2013 when we get into providing guidance for 2019, we'll talk more specifically about Australia for next year. Obviously, there are market effects that are going on right now in terms of consumer credit, which are certainly going to negatively impact Australia in the fourth quarter and depending on the duration certainly going into next year. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC : Thank you very much. Operator : As there are no further questions, I would like to hand the call back over to your host for any additional or closing remarks. Trevor Burns - Equifax, Inc.: Yeah, this is Trevor Burns. I just want to thank everybody for joining the call. Anybody had any follow-up questions I'll be available today and tomorrow. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. That will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. Ladies and gentlemen, you may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Trevor Burns, Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir. Trevor Burns : Thanks and good morning. Welcome to today\u2019s conference call. I\u2019m Trevor Burns, Investor Relations. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com. During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including first quarter and full-year 2019 guidance to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risk factors, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2018 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. Also, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. For the fourth quarter of 2018, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes costs associated with the realignment of internal resources and other activities, acquisition-related amortization expense, the income tax effects of stock awards recognized upon vesting or settlement and foreign currency losses from remeasuring the Argentinean peso denominated net monetary assets. Adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax also excludes legal and professional fees related to the cybersecurity incidents, principally fees relating to our outstanding litigation and government investigations as well as the incremental project cost designed to enhance technology and data security. This includes projects to implement systems and processes to enhance our technology and data security infrastructure, as well as our projects to replace and substantially consolidate our global networking systems, as well as the cost to manage these projects. These projects that will transform our technology infrastructure and further enhance our data security were incurred throughout 2018 and are expected to occur in 2019 and in 2020. Adjusted EBITDA has defined as net income attributable to Equifax adding back interest expense, net of interest income, income tax expense; depreciation and amortization; and also as the case for adjusted EPS, excluding cost related to 2017 cybersecurity incident, cost associated with the realignment of internal resources and other activities and foreign currency losses from remeasuring the Argentinean peso denominated net monetary assets. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our website. In addition to the non-GAAP measures that we posted on our website we are now posting certain supplemental financial information on our Investor Relations deck on our website to better help you understand our business. In the Form 10-K to be filed later today, we will disclose that future losses from litigation and regulatory investigations associated with the 2017 cybersecurity incident are reasonably possible, but not yet estimable at this stage in the proceedings. Now, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Mark. Mark Begor : Thanks, Trevor. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll start to discuss this morning with a few minutes on our fourth quarter results and then move to a discussion on our strategy, technology transformation, and 2019 guidance. So first on the fourth quarter. Revenue came in at $835 million, which was up 2% in constant currency. This was at the \u2013 inside the range that we had given you a few months ago, but at the low end of that guidance. During the quarter, we experienced a weaker-than-expected U.S. mortgage market as inquiries were down approximately 15% or about 500 basis points weaker than we expected. Versus the fourth quarter 2017, a weaker mortgage market impacted overall revenue growth by about 2% and versus our guidance by just under $500 million \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, $5 million. The mortgage market declines have been challenging to forecast well. Excluding this mortgage market impact, overall revenue growth was about 4%, which we were pleased with. Importantly, USIS revenue grew almost 2% excluding the impact of the declining U.S. mortgage market. EWS reported growth of the strong 12% and international local currency revenue growth of 5% was impacted by a soft Australia and Argentinean market, and in line with the third quarter. USIS growth of 2% excluding the mortgage market impact was another sequential quarterly growth for that business as it continues to return to a growth mode. Adjusted EPS of a $1.38 per share, includes $0.04 per share due to a lower tax rate than in our October guidance. Adjusting for the incremental tax benefit, adjusted EPS of a $1.34 per share was about $0.02 above the midpoint of the guidance we provided last October. Total non-recurring and one-time costs in the fourth quarter were $181 million. This includes $114 million of technology and security, $12 million of legal and regulatory, $9 million for consumer support, and $46 million for the cost reduction action we executed late in the quarter. In our Investor Relations presentation on our website, we\u2019ve included a chart that detailed the breakdown of these costs for each quarter of 2018, as well as our guidance for 2019. So now a few more comments on the business units in the fourth quarter. As I mentioned, USIS revenue was down 2% on a reported basis compared to last year, but importantly, USIS was up 2% excluding the 400 basis point impact of the mortgage market. For us, this is a positive sign of continued improvement and a return to a growth mode for this critical business inside of Equifax. Online was up slightly overall and was up 4% excluding the mortgage market. This is the second quarter in a row we\u2019ve seen Online growth excluding the mortgage market impact. Mortgage Solutions was down double-digits as expected given the decline in the mortgage market, and to a lesser extent channel shift with mortgage resellers, partially offset by new products we introduced early in 2018. CMS or Credit Marketing Services was up about 2%, which is the first time we\u2019ve seen growth in this segment since the first quarter of 2018. Overall Financial Marketing Services was down about 1% as IXI saw volume declines. In our Commercial and Telecom and Utilities segments, both grew double-digits in the quarter. As you can see, absent the substantial impact of a declining mortgage market, we\u2019re starting to see growth in recovery in USIS, which we expect to continue in 2019. In terms of our U.S. customers, we\u2019re back to selling across the portfolio of our customer base. As we discussed on prior calls, the substantial progress with customers started in mid-2018 and so given our six to 18 months sales cycle, we should start to see those benefits of being in a commercial mode with our customers during the early part in first half of 2019, with accelerating improvements in the second half of 2019. We continue to believe that our differentiated data assets coupled with our technology investments will return USIS to its traditional growth mode, but we remain cautious about the pace of the recovery, given the complexities of dealing with new customers and dealing with existing customers on new products. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins of 47.5% were down from fourth quarter 2017 or at the highest levels in 2018. I\u2019m sure you saw our announcement, a week ago, that Sid Singh joined us as President of USIS. Sid joins us from Global Payments where he served as Group President of Integrated Solutions and Vertical Markets. Sid brings a deep understanding of unique data and how to accelerate product development through leveraging data analytics and advanced technology platforms. He is a high energy growth leader with real depth in technology and an intense focus on customers. Sid joined Global Payments in 2006 and was instrumental in developing the technology and software-led business strategy to help transform Global Payments into a highly differentiated payments leader. Prior to his work at Global Payments, Sid held senior management positions with HSBC and Citibank. We are thrilled to have Sid joining our leadership team. As you saw in the announcement, a week ago also, Paulino has agreed to work closely with Sid on his transition and help me with our strategy, M&A and partnership efforts. Both Paulino and I will work closely with Sid to drive USIS back to growth and to assist in his transition into Equifax. USIS continues to be a personal priority of me and the entire company. Shifting now to Workforce Solutions, that business had a very strong quarter with revenue up 12%. Verification Services was very strong in the quarter with revenue up 15%, driven by strong double-digit growth across healthcare, government talent solutions, debt management, card and auto. EWS like USIS was also impacted by the decline in the overall mortgage market, which negatively impacted their revenue growth by about 400 basis points. Ex-mortgage, EWS would have been up a very strong 16%. Employer Services also grew in the quarter up 6%, principally driven by growth in I-9 and onboarding services. The strong verifier growth resulted in a very strong adjusted EBITDA margins of 48.7% or an expansion in the quarter of 320 basis points. As I have indicated before, Rudy and his entire team are laser-focused on the Work Number record growth. The team continues to execute on a strategy to identify and acquire new data contributors to expand its data assets. The team added more records in the fourth quarter than any prior quarter over the past five years. Total Work Number records are now approaching 90 million, and I think as you know from your experience with the company, when we add a new record its quickly monetized. We expect this Work Number growth to continue in 2019. EWS is clearly an extremely attractive franchise business for Equifax with big growth potential in the future. International revenue was down on a reported basis 3%, but up 5% in local currency, which was about consistent with third quarter 2018 but weaker than the 8% delivered in the first half of 2018. This slower growth in the second half of 2018 continues to be driven by the weak consumer and commercial lending markets in Australia that really started to soften in September and the ongoing weak economic conditions in Argentina. Our Latin America business grew high single digits in local currency in the fourth quarter, despite the continued headwinds in Argentina that began early in 2018. Revenue growth was driven by double-digit constant currency growth in Chile, Ecuador, Paraguay, and Mexico, and high single-digit growth in Argentina and Uruguay. Our Latin America franchises are benefiting from the expansion of Ignite and InterConnect SaaS in 2018, which we rolled out and strong NPI rollouts in both 2017 and 2018. Our European business grew between mid and high single digits in local currency in the fourth quarter. We continue to see high single-digit local currency growth in our European credit operations. And as we expected, our European debt management business started to return to growth in the fourth quarter. Shifting to Canada. Our business in Canada grew mid-single digits in local currency in the fourth quarter, slightly below our expectation reflecting the timing of some project-based revenues between quarters. Canada\u2019s full year local currency revenue growth of 8% with broad based, reflecting our focus on customer innovation and new products. Our Asia-Pacific business grew low single-digits in local currency in the fourth quarter, down from the 10% plus growth seen in the first half of 2018, and consistent with the weakening we began to see in September around consumer lending, particularly mortgage and other consumer credit markets in Australia. While we expect to see continued weakness in Australia credit markets as we move into 2019, we\u2019re focused on innovative new customer solutions specifically in our Australian commercial business. Adjusted International EBITDA margins at 32.4% were up nicely in the fourth quarter, reflecting improvements in Europe and Asia-Pacific. I continue to be excited about our international business in the collaborative and innovation growth focus we are seeing from John and our Global team. Global Consumer Solutions revenue declined 12% on a reported and local currency basis in the fourth quarter and was in line with our expectations. As we\u2019ve discussed throughout 2018, our GCS U.S. Consumer Direct business saw substantial revenue declines as a result of our suspension of U.S. consumer advertising in the fall of 2017 after the cybersecurity incident. U.S. Consumer Direct business revenue declined almost 25% in the fourth quarter to $27 million and was down over $40 million to $118 million for the full year. Dann and his team began limited direct marketing to U.S. consumers in October and that continued through the fourth quarter and into 2019. While our marketing investment in the fourth quarter was lower than historical levels, we saw subscriber growth at cost that were consistent with our expectations, a very positive sign as we enter 2019. Our GCS partner business which include ID Watchdog delivered high single-digit growth in the fourth quarter and double-digit growth for the year. We expect ID Watchdog to continue to grow double-digits and continue to see growth \u2013 nice growth opportunities in our partner business, both in U.S. and internationally. Adjusted EBITDA margins in GCS declined to 21.1% in the fourth quarter as expected, as we saw the impact of the revenue loss and the impact are beginning to ramp our advertising as we went into the marketplace. We expect margins in GCS to increase in 2019 as we see the benefit of fourth quarter and early 2019 advertising, and leverage our growing partner revenue. So before I get into discussion of 2019, I\u2019d like to take a minute to look back on 2018, which was clearly a challenging year for Equifax by any measure. The 2017 cybersecurity incident had a massive impact on our business on many fronts, and we entered 2018 with a great deal of uncertainty, from changes including team leadership positions, including the CEO role, U.S. customer concerns that we worked on throughout the year. Our competitors clearly took aggressive actions when we were on our heels. You know we were addressing a wide range of legal and regulatory matters, and we\u2019re executing on a multi-year security and technology transformation. So looking back, although our path to returning to our traditional growth mode is taking longer than we expected, we\u2019ve made very strong steps forward in 2018 and our path back to growth in market leadership. I\u2019m very proud of several key accomplishments. First, data security was a primary focus for our team and we made great progress, including instilling a security first culture across all of Equifax. We have a much stronger data security infrastructure and are committed to continuing to invest to be the industry leader in data security. We launched our multiyear technology investment transformation program that will take our technology to market leading capabilities and deliver a cost savings and speeder market \u2013 speeder products to market. This is a transformational investment and I\u2019ll cover this in more detail in a few minutes. We also made great strides in protecting and empowering consumers launching new free services like Lock and Alert to lock and freeze consumers\u2019 credit files. In our USIS business, we made massive steps towards regaining the trust of our customers and partners and are now positioned to operate in a normal commercial mode. And lastly, we refined our go-forward strategy and execution plans for the next two years that internally and externally we\u2019re calling EFX 2020. I\u2019ll cover this in a more detail shortly. We could not have accomplished these goals without the hard work and dedication of our 11,000 employees around the globe. We clearly have work to do in 2019, but 2018 set us up with a solid foundation for returning Equifax to growth and market leadership. So let me turn to 2019 as well as a few comments looking forward to 2020. Since joining in Equifax last April, I\u2019ve learned a great deal about the company and the state of the business. When I joined I was clear that I believe this strategy and direction of the company was sound, and I continue to believe that is true. However, there are some critical areas in which we must sharpen our focus to return to and exceed the levels of performance we delivered in the past. In late 2018, we launched what we are calling EFX 2020 as a framework for our investments and priorities for the future. These strategic initiatives that will make up our EFX 2020 strategy represented blending of the successful strategy in place when I arrived in these new focus areas. First, Equifax is a data analytics technology company. To be a technology company, we need to deliver market-leading technology embed that technologies as part of our products. We are convinced that our massive technology transformation to the cloud will differentiate our products by combining unique data assets, analytics and leading technology and will allow us to accelerate the speed of our new products to market in the ease which they\u2019re consumed by our customers. I\u2019ll talk a lot more about this in a minute when I discuss our technology transformation in more detail. Number two. Being an industrial leader in data security, this is and will remain our \u2013 will remain central to our culture and our commitment. We made massive progress in the past 18 months and we still have more to do \u2013 more work to do. We are committed to be an industry leader on security. Number three. Creating a culture of customer centricity. We talked on prior calls about how important this is to me, and this is how I operate as a business leader, and this starts by getting our people closer to customers, adding more feet on the street, our renewed focus on new verticals like FinTech, embedding our data scientist and Ignite technology with our customers on their sites, collaborating with customers in our DNA labs to do products that they need and embracing partners, the strength Equifax has and one that we are going to expand. All of these efforts are focused on accelerating innovation and growth, jointly with our customers, partners, to drive new products and to drive growth. This is an area which we\u2019re doubling down on. Number four. Being a market leader in data analytics through leveraging unique data assets in the application of artificial intelligence, machine learning and advanced visualization on the leading edge of delivery platforms is critical to our future. To be a market leader, we must with collaborate customers and partners broadly, and we must prioritize investment through the acquisition of new unique data sources. We have differentiated data assets like NC Plus and TWN where we will continue to invest heavily in new data sets organically and through M&A like with our data acquisition last summer and through partnerships. This is a critical priority. Number five. Improve the consumer experience by providing value-added services through consumer centric digital and voice consumer support. We\u2019re building leading edge services and we will be rolling them out beginning in 2019 that will enhance our customer experience. Number six. Bringing innovative new products to market in collaboration with our customers, leveraging our global data assets is always been a strength of Equifax. We are refocusing on our speed to market and leveraging products across our global footprint. These six initiatives are all focused on driving revenue and profitable growth for our customers and our shareholders and returning Equifax to a growth mode and market leadership. To succeed on each of these initiatives, we are also refocused on our execution and delivery. Say do, that\u2019s how I operate. Making and meeting commitments. This was an Equifax strength and it will be again. Shifting to the technology transformation we started in 2018. It\u2019s is critical to delivery of all of our strategic imperatives and it will provide us with substantial product delivery and cost advantages. Our EFX 2020 technology program is the largest investment program in Equifax history and is the complete focus of the entire leadership team. This is not a technology project. This is a technology and business led transformation of Equifax. During the second half of 2018, we provided guidance that our security and technology investment plan would continue not only in 2018, but through 2019 and 2020. We also told you that we provide you a framework around our security and technology plan early in 2019 and we\u2019re going to do that today. In 2018, we spent $307 million and expect Equifax 2020 spending to continue during 2019 and 2020. We plan to spend $300 million this year in 2019. In 2020, the spend will be below our 2019 runway. Including incremental capital spending between 2018 and 2020, we will invest an incremental $1.25 billion to modernize our global technology and security infrastructure. We are convinced this will differentiate Equifax and move us back into a market leading position. There\u2019s three basic principles that underpin our Equifax 2020 technology strategy that we\u2019re executing. First, cloud first and cloud native. This focus \u2013 this effort is focused on moving our legacy mainframe in server technology to the public cloud using native services provided by the public cloud providers to the greatest extent possible. This includes our network and transportation. From a security perspective, we will implement generally in virtual private clouds or private instances on the public cloud infrastructure. Second, we\u2019re going to build on application services principles. This isn\u2019t a new concept, but it\u2019s is critical if we are successfully execute the cloud first and native technology strategy. In concept, this mean building services or components that can be easily assembled or interconnected using standard APIs. Again, this is not new, but it takes a tremendous amount of discipline to execute it. Number three. Our relentless focus on rationalization. As we build our company for the future, it\u2019s critical that we remain focused on decommissioning our legacy data centers, applications, data platforms and servers. This will ensure we reached the robust security posture and long-term operational cost improvements we\u2019re committed to. Number four, and most important is great talent. You\u2019ve heard me talk and us talk about our new technology team led by Bryson Koehler. Bryson has upgraded over 50% of his leadership team in the last six months with top talent from market-leading technology organizations. We\u2019re building the right team to execute this critical transformation. We\u2019ve five major tracks to our technology transformation. These tracks underpinned by detailed resource plans and timelines are expected to be executed between 2019 and 2020. In the Investor Relations deck that we posted via our IR website this morning, we\u2019ve diagrams for these tracks. Here is a summary. First, we will implement a common data fabric for data ingestion, governance, enrichment and management. The data fabric replaces our multiple current purpose-built data ingestion, cleansing and matching processes and systems, and the data exchanges themselves. For example, Acro, a U.S. credit exchange in the Work Number. Our data fabric is being built on the Google Go \u2013 Google Cloud platform in a virtual private cloud environment using Google\u2019s native tooling. By executing in its way, we can take advantage of Google\u2019s vast scale, and more importantly, the leading edge tools that are proven its scale and speed and that Google uses themselves. Our new data fabric will conceptually be one repository as opposed to the many siloed databases that we have today. This single data fabric will deliver seamless real-time integration and data access across our many unique data sources. As I indicated, our data fabric is already in place with Google Cloud and in the first half of 2019, we\u2019ll be rolling that out. We\u2019ll have our U.S. ACRO credit exchange and TWN EWS exchange running in parallel with our current systems and available for multi-data insights in the first half of 2019. Several of our other U.S. and EWS exchanges including NCTUE, IXI, DataX in an unemployment claims, as well as Ignite will migrate to the common data cloud fabric by the end of 2019. We will begin decommissioning existing exchanges that we have migrated to the data fabric in early 2020. We will continue this migration of our U.S. and global exchanges to the data fabric throughout 2020. Second, we will rebuild or migrate our customer applications using standard application in cloud native services and operate them in the public cloud. Fortunately, this track is one Equifax started a number of years ago in 2016, with the initiation of InterConnect SaaS product, which is a set of application services that offers a global data gateway decisioning, using sparkling logic in an API framework. This continue with the launch of our Ignite application, which is a market-leading, analytical application that allows customers to easily Equifax third-party and their own attributes and data for analytics and modeling. Over the past year, Equifax has worked to migrate these applications to a virtual private cloud utilizing cloud native services. We are also making great progress in integrating Ignite and InterConnect app services to allow customers to seamlessly promote attribution models defined in Ignite, including those driven by machine learning into production on InterConnect. We\u2019re working to make this broadly available by the end of the first quarter of 2019. In the fourth quarter, we completed implementation of Ignite Direct and InterConnect in a virtual private cloud in Europe and Latin America. Deployments of Ignite Direct with InterConnect in U.S., Canada and Asia-Pacific are to be completed in the first quarter of 2019. Ignite marketplace was deployed for all regions in 2018 and is expected to be cloud native by the later part of 2019. This same process will be followed to build new applications or migrate existing applications going forward. Third, we will migrate customers from legacy decisioning systems, interface systems and Ignite instances to InterConnect SaaS and Ignite in the cloud. Globally, Equifax has over 4,000 customers operating on an Equifax decisioning or analytical system. Over 2019 and 2020, we expect to migrate the vast majority of these customers to standard InterConnect SaaS and Ignite cloud applications. In USIS, we expect to migrate 60% of our customers by the end of 2019 with the vast majority of customers migrating by the end of 2020. Similar plans are in place for each region around the globe. Fourth, we will migrate our global consumer systems and customer and consumer support systems using standard application services and cloud data services and operate them on the public cloud. Fortunately, this is also attractive as we started several years ago. Our new consumer system that will include digital consumer support called, Renaissance, is in the process of being migrated to a virtual private cloud environment utilizing cloud data services. We launched Renaissance in Canada in the fourth quarter and will launch in the U.S. in mid-2019. Separately, we are deploying sales force in Genesis for customer and consumer support worldwide. We expect significant deployment of all these systems to be ongoing throughout 2019. Last, we\u2019ll move corporate in some of our business support applications to SaaS services and public cloud. For example, Equifax will be moving its email and collaboration to Google Gmail during the early part of 2019. Oracle Financial Systems will operate on EWS in the second quarter and our sales management applications will be moved to the sales force cloud between 2019 and 2020. I hope this gives you a sense of the pace and urgency of our technology transformation, as well as the measurable and real progress we are already making as we deliver new cloud-based technology to our customers. As I referenced earlier, diagrams of these tracks are provided on our Investor Relations deck on our website. During 2019, we plan to have our new technology leader Bryson Koehler provide more details to you around our Equifax 2020 technology plan, and John will provide some more details on the cost estimates to execute this plan in his portion of the presentation this morning. All of these actions are being executed consistent with our commitment to be a leader in data analytics and technology. We\u2019re convinced that this a transformational investment for Equifax. And I want to make it clear one more time. This is not a technology refresh. We are changing how the way we operate, the way we go to market, in the way we serve our customers through technology. We made strong steps forward in the fourth quarter and we\u2019ll continue our efforts in 2019 and 2020 as we complete elements of our multi-year plan on a monthly basis going forward. As we discussed on the last call and to align with our strategic goals, we did make some structural changes within Equifax, focused on driving more of our resources and decision-making closer to customers and further optimizing our resource structure. As you may recall, in August, we realigned our resources and decision-making to move our organization closer to market \u2013 market-facing business unit teams and away from headquarters. This is an important element of how I operate of having our teams closer and more focused with our customers. In the fourth quarter, we completed a plan to optimize our G&A and headquarters costs. In connection with these activities, we took a one-time charge in the fourth quarter of $46 million. While these actions are expected to improve our margins, we plan to reinvest some of the cost savings into more DNA resources and more sales resources to drive growth. We\u2019re also moving to embed more of our commercial and DNA resources in our customers\u2019 locations to further drive engagement, service and growth. Net full year run rate savings from this fourth quarter action are expected to exceed $50 million. I\u2019m energized about the steps we\u2019re taking to move our organization closer to customers and markets. Shifting to new product innovation. This remains a key priority and a real Equifax strength. We have an active pipeline of new product introductions with over 100 new products at various stages in the funnel and we launched 61 new products last year, consistent with the number we launched in 2017 and 2016. And as we talked on prior calls, protecting the resources and technology resources around NPI was critical to us in 2018. NPI and new product growth is a real strength and focus of Equifax. I talked about the growth potential Workforce Solutions being in the second inning, a reference to the amount of run rate \u2013 runway they have in front of them to grow their database as well as provide innovative new solutions. Recently, Workforce Solutions identified two new use cases for their Work Number. The first use is our data with consumer consent to allow for enhanced identity matching. Identity matching has become an increasingly challenging issue for most of our customers and have a unique data assets like the Work Number is improving our customers\u2019 processes and workflow and allowing consumers to more easily obtain the services and benefits they need. The second new use case, also using our verification data, help FinTech customers and the online digital lending customers provide a frictionless and superior consumer lending experience by providing better lending decisions in a streamlined and automated manner. As our FinTech and online lending customers look to expand lending to near and subprime customers, while controlling for risk, our new Work Number database provides meaningful data to make better decisions, benefiting both consumers and our customers. So now let me shift gears and take a look at 2019 guidance. For 2019, we expect total revenue to be between $3.425 billion and $3.525 billion, reflecting currency revenue growth of 2% to 5%. This assumes the U.S. mortgage market will decline about 5% in 2019 or about 1% headwind to our revenue growth. FX will negatively impact revenue adjusted EPS by just over 100 basis points. USIS revenue expected to be up slightly in 2019, including the approximately 150 basis point negative impact from the U.S. mortgage market decline. First half growth will be more negatively impacted by the mortgage decline from a comparison standpoint. EWS revenue growth will strengthen from 2018 with growth approaching 10%. Verification Services, we expect to deliver very strong growth and employer services flat to up slightly. International revenue growth will grow about 5%. First half growth being impacted by continued weakness in Australia lending markets and the Argentinean economy, and we are expecting to return to high-single digit growth in the second half of 2019. And lastly, GCS revenue will be flat in 2019. First half revenue will decline year-over-year and we expect to return to growth in the second half of 2019 based on the new efforts that we have in marketing inside of that business. For 2019, we expect adjusted EPS to be between $5.60 and $5.80 per share, reflecting constant currency improvement of about 1.75% to down 1.75%. We expect to see expanded business unit EBITDA margins of about 50 basis points, led by nice revenue growth and margin growth at Workforce, to drive increased operating profit and EBITDA dollars from business units. Offsetting our increased margins are really three principal factors : number one, higher corporate costs of about $25 million, principally in security and related technology investments; second, increased interest expense of about $5 million reflecting the refinancing executed midway through 2018; and third, a slightly higher tax rate of 24% in 2019. John will provide more details on our guidance, EFX 2020, investment plans for 2019 and 2020, as well as a significant market factors impacting the first half of 2019. Wrapping up. Equifax has made strong progress in 2018 in regaining the trust of our customers and partners. We moved back to a growth mode with our customers. And we completed the first phase of our three-year EFX 2020 transformation plan. We are confident that we\u2019re moving in the right direction, but we know we still have a lot of work to do. We\u2019re investing at record levels to make Equifax a market leader in data analytics, technology and security. We\u2019re excited about our future and the opportunities ahead. With that, let me turn it over to John. John Gamble : Thanks, Mark, and good morning everyone. I will generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis, but will refer to non-GAAP results as well. As Trevor mentioned, we have excluded certain items from our GAAP results in order to calculate adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted EPS. We\u2019ve provided the details on these items in our earnings release, so you can consider them in your analysis. As Mark covered our overall results and the business unit details, I\u2019ll cover overall margin, some corporate items, and provide the additional detail on our guidance. In the fourth quarter, general corporate expense was $168 million. Excluding the non-recurring costs associated with the cybersecurity incident and the costs associated with the realignment of internal resources, the adjusted general corporate expense for the quarter was $76 million, up $23 million from 4Q 2017. The increase principally reflects three items : increased investment in security and transformation and related technologies; increased variable compensation reflecting the reduced compensation in 4Q 2017, following the cyber attack; and cost of Lock and Alert, the free consumer service launched in 2018. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 33.2% in 4Q 2018, down 160 basis points from 4Q 2017. The business unit adjusted EBITDA margin in total were up 50 basis points, as Workforce and the international, both grew EBITDA margins nicely year-to-year and USIS saw other margins increased sequentially. The decline in adjusted EBITDA margins is principally due to the increases in corporate cost I just discussed, as well as lower GCS margins as we have started to advertise. For 4Q 2018, the effective tax rate used in calculating adjusted EPS was 21.4%. In our 4Q guidance in October, we indicated that we expected our 4Q 2018 effective tax rate used for adjusted EPS to be about 24%. The lower tax rate reflects the reduction in our ongoing foreign tax rate due to recently issued guidance concerning the 2017 Tax Act, as well as the year-to-date catch up in 4Q 2018. The benefit between the 21.4% effective tax rate achieved and 24% was a benefit of about $0.04 a share. For 1Q 2019 and calendar year 2019, we expect our effective tax rate used in calculating adjusted EPS to be about 24%. Our effective tax rate for adjusted EPS in 2018 was 22.6%. Now turning to 2019, I\u2019d like to provide some details on the guidance Mark provided and some perspective on the changes from 2018. A few important assumptions underpinning our 2019 guidance : FX is expected to negatively impact by just over 1% and adjusted EPS by approximately $0.08 a share. The greatest impact on revenue will be in the first and second quarter at negative 3% and 2% respectively. U.S. mortgage market inquiries for all of 2019 are expected to decline about 5%. 1Q 2019 increase are expected to be weak, down about 13%, just slightly better than we saw in 4Q 2018. 2Q 2019 increase are expected to be down mid-single digits and we expect increase to continue to improve, getting to be about flat in 3Q and slightly positive in 4Q. The impact of the mortgage market on Equifax growth is significant in the first half of 2019, impacting total revenue negatively by about 2.5% and 1% in 1Q and 2Q respectively, and then becoming positive in 4Q just under one point. For USIS, the impact is more significant, impacting revenue growth negatively by just over 4% and about 1% in 1Q and 2Q respectively, and positively by about 1% in the fourth quarter. The impact on Workforce is negative about 3% and 1.5% in 1Q and 2Q respectively, and positive about 1% in the fourth quarter. Australian credit markets are expected to stay weak through Q2 2019, and then begin to improve in the second half. We\u2019re assuming Argentina\u2019s economic crisis will continue through 2Q and then begin to abate in the second half with the economy remaining weak throughout the year. The weakness in Australia and Argentina through the first half are expected to impact International revenue growth negatively by about 2% in the first half of the year. As we look to our guidance for 2019, these market factors, specifically the U.S. mortgage market, and Australia and Argentina market conditions, have a substantial negative impact on 1Q 2019 and 2Q 2019 constant currency revenue growth. 1Q and 2Q revenue growth are negatively impacted by roughly 3% and 1.5% respectively with this impact expected to actually swing positive \u2013 slightly positive by 4Q. This also impacts adjusted EPS. If we are looking at 1Q 2019, the negative three percentage points of revenue impact versus 1Q 2018, is about $25 million of revenue. At Equifax, average gross profit that revenue reduction impacts operating profit by more than $15 million. Three additional factors are impacting quarterly timing and total 2019 results. The quarterly timing of corporate expenses in 2019, as Mark indicated, corporate expenses are expected to increase by \u2013 in 2019 by about $25 million, principally in the first half. The increase is primarily in higher security and related technology costs. These cost ramp significantly during 2018, reaching a run rate in the second half. In the first half of 2019, we are seeing significant increases year-to-year as we are now operating at the higher run rate we reached in the second half of 2018. 2019 full year variable and equity comp is up versus 2018, as 2018 variable comp paid out below target and 2019 long-term incentives have been adjusted to support execution over the period of our technology transformation. Additionally, in the first half of 2018, we did not have a full executive leadership team. So equity comp increases are principally in the first half of 2019. We have also increased our investments in data and analytics in 2019 relative to 2018. In total, these increases are partially offset by reduced cost and corporate staff, such as finance, marketing and HR. Approximately, $15 million of the $25 million increase in corporate expenses will be in the first quarter of 2019. Global consumer performance in 1Q 2019 will be down, as in 1Q 2018, U.S. consumer direct revenue was still at relatively high levels, and we had stopped U.S. marketing spend. This will result in 1Q 2019 revenue being down about $5 million and operating profit down about $8 million year-to-year. GCS performance relative to 2018 is expected to improve each quarter in 2019 and we believe show growth as we exit the year. The savings from the cost actions taken in 4Q 2018 will increase as we move through 2019, as well as the planned actions \u2013 as the planned actions are completed. Savings in 1Q 2019 are just under $10 million. The increase in our 2019 effective tax rate for adjusted EPS is 24%, reflects the discrete benefits received in 2018 that we do not believe will occur in 2019. We believe our run rate \u2013 tax rate is slightly lower in 2019 than 2018. For 1Q 2019, we expect revenue in the range of $840 million to $855 million, reflecting constant currency revenue growth of flat to up just under 2%. We\u2019re expecting adjusted EPS to be $1.15 to $1.20 per share. FX is approximately negative 3% on revenue on 1Q 2019, and negatively impacting adjusted EPS by $0.05 a share. The combination of the market factors impacting revenue and the timing of corporate expenses, cost actions savings and global consumer are impacting 1Q 2019 revenue by about $30 million, operating profit by about $30 million, and adjusted EPS by almost $0.20 a share. As a reminder, these factors are expected to diminish somewhat in the second quarter and actually be a year-to-year positive as we get to the fourth quarter. These factors, as well as increased interest expense of about $0.02 per share is what is driving the decline in adjusted EPS in 1Q 2019. In 2019, we expect to incur approximately $350 million in non-recurring expenses, $300 million in non-recurring security and technology transformation, and $50 million related to legal and regulatory. This does not include the cost of any potential judgments or other outcomes should they occur. For the status of the legal and regulatory matters, I would refer you to our 10-K. Mark provided a perspective on total incremental spending on security and technology transformation over the 2018 to 2020 period. In that calculation, we include the expense on non-recurring security and technology transformation and the incremental capital spending defined as any spending above the $214 million per year we spent in 2017. For 2018, the total incremental spend was about $460 million, and our guidance for 2019 is about $450 million. Beyond 2020, we will not exclude non-recurring security and technology transformation expenses from our adjusted EPS. And with that, operator, we\u2019ll open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from George Mihalos with Cowen. Please go ahead. George Mihalos : Great. Good morning guys. So, just to kind of kick things off on the guidance, the 2% to 5% outlook for 2019, that high-end is a little higher than what we were thinking, which is good to see. So just wanted to get a sense of what you\u2019re seeing in the marketplace, kind of competitively? How things are shaping up if you\u2019re seeing any sort of changes in some of your key verticals for macro? And then maybe just related to that, I mean to hit that 5%, if you hit the top end given the zero to two you\u2019re starting with, I mean, that would suggest that your growth rate is almost kind of going back to sort of the historic target that you would put out there. How comfortable are you with that? Mark Begor : Yes. I think, George, it\u2019s Mark here, and John will jump into it. I think you have to look at the pieces of the business obviously. I think you understand EWS pretty well and we\u2019ve been pretty clear that they\u2019re kind of coming out of the fourth quarter quite strong with the record growth that they have. So, there\u2019s a lot of confidence in their growth going forward. GCS is another one that John and I talked about, the kind of sequential improvement in that is going to drive that revenue growth as we go into the fourth quarter and as you know, it was a drag in 2018. International, Australia is clearly a pressure for that business in the kind of latter part of 2018. We expect that to continue through the first couple of quarters of 2019, but then we start getting into a comparison, where it started to decline in September last year that will be helpful from a year-over-year standpoint. And then really the USIS business I think is where you\u2019re probably focusing your question is, their recovery going forward in \u2013 we continue to see positive pipeline builds, there\u2019s more discussions in the marketplace, we\u2019re really out of the penalty box with all of our customers that kind of happened months ago and we\u2019re back into a more normal mode with NPI and everything else that we have going on. At the same time, I would say that range reflects, we\u2019re cautious about that recovery and that\u2019s why we want to be clear about that \u2013 that recovery has been unpredictable. They\u2019ve got the headwind of mortgage that again starts comping out in the second half of next year, where we expect the declines to abate and that helps from a year-over-year comparison, but the USIS recovery is one that we\u2019re convinced is going to happen. We see signs of it. You look at the fourth quarter performance ex mortgage, we\u2019re pleased with that for USIS and we expect that to continue going forward and the range we try to put in place is to show that there\u2019s some predictability challenges, primarily in USIS. What would you add, John? John Gamble : Yes. I think Mark covered it very fully. Just one other fact to be aware of, right. If you look at the fourth quarter and you exclude GCS, even with a very weak mortgage market, we had 4% growth again in the other three large businesses. So again, what we think we\u2019re seeing is continued progress, because holding it 4% given that the substantial degradation in the mortgage market, we think again those show that we\u2019re continuing to see progress in the three main businesses. And as Mark said, we do expect to see GCS to substantially better as you get into the end of next year, not because that\u2019s driving lots of growth, they\u2019re simply lapping a lower level of revenues you get in the second half and we\u2019re just expecting that we\u2019re going to start to see subscribers kind of flatten out as they can in our market. So, as we said, we do have a broad range still in our guidance, but those are the factors driving us forward. George Mihalos : That\u2019s great. Really appreciate the color. And just as a quick follow-up, maybe on the margin front. I think you guys talked about the business units expanding margins by about 50 bps. Any sort of color you can kind of give on a segment level, and then just a point of clarity. It looks like what you\u2019re saying is from an adjusted EBITDA perspective that EBITDA margins will be, call it, flat to somewhat up, given some of the commentary around tax and interest expense working against you? Thanks. John Gamble : Yes. So as Mark said, looking at the business units, we expect them to be up. It\u2019s really being driven by EWS. EWS is going \u2013 we expect to have a nice year, verifier is going to grow very strong, and as you know, verifier revenue is very, very rich in margin. We\u2019re also expecting to see international to be up slightly. USIS margin performance, we think is going to be better than it was this year. It may not be up, but we\u2019re expecting to see much better performance than we saw this year. And GCS, they\u2019re going to be down. We said we\u2019re going to start advertising, so you\u2019re going to see declines. But when you add that all up, we think that\u2019s why we get some comfort that we\u2019re looking at BU margins that are better, again as you look across the range of our guidance that are flattish to up. So we think that\u2019s absolutely a positive sign. Corporate expense, high in the first quarter, right, and it\u2019s high into the first quarter, because of equity. So, you\u2019re seeing corporate expense on an absolute basis should actually decline as you go through the year, because of the fact that the \u2013 our equity and variable comp is so much higher in the first half \u2013 in first quarter, sorry. And the other thing that benefits us quite honestly is first quarter revenue historically, and this quarter is low. So as revenue grows, the margin effect of those fixed costs in corporate that we\u2019re talking about actually goes down, and that benefits our margins as we go through the year. So you get \u2013 you get kind of merge all that together and I think that\u2019s how you get the improving margin performance we\u2019re talking about through the year. Hey, there are risks; Mark talked about them. The biggest risk obviously is sector information. We need to execute for that to be \u2013 for us to be successful on our margins and as we move more and more things to the cloud, those costs will certainly start to affect us, but net-net, we think \u2013 we think that I covered it pretty full. George Mihalos : Great. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead. Manav Patnaik : Thank you, good morning. My first question, John, maybe you could just help us understand what the free cash flow dynamics are, there\u2019s a lot of moving pieces. Can you just talk about what CapEx should be and how we should think about conversion to free cash flow broadly for the next two years? John Gamble : Yes. So, I\u2019m not going to go out to two years, right. But in terms of CapEx, I think CapEx for next year \u2013 this year, sorry 2019, we\u2019re expecting it to be kind of flat, right, with this year. The other dynamic that you\u2019re going to see in 2019 is that we don\u2019t really have the insurance proceeds recovery, but importantly, as you look at 2018, and obviously, we published our cash flow, the nice thing that you see is our net debt position actually improved as we went through the year. And even with the increased CapEx that substantially increased obviously non-recurring technology investments, as well as some small acquisitions we are able to continue to keep the balance sheet very strong and since we think our operating performance is somewhat consistent in 2019 versus 2018, as well as we\u2019re talking about some lower levels of overall spending in 2019 slightly on the technology transformation, we would expect that we would be able to maintain a good balance sheet position as we go through 2019 as well. Manav Patnaik : Okay. And Mark, just I guess a broader question. I mean there\u2019s obviously a lot of change, lot of transformation, like you said many times, have to happen, I mean, it\u2019s pretty quick compared to, I guess, what we\u2019ve at least seen before. How do you plan around this to avoid any hiccups? I mean, what\u2019s the \u2013 what\u2019s the game plan there broadly and how you\u2019re going to structure this? Mark Begor : Yes, Manav, it\u2019s a great question. As you might imagine that lost on me and the rest of the leadership team. This is a massive undertaking on our part, it\u2019s one that you have to execute well and what are we doing about it? First, it starts with having great people and I talked about the rebuild of our technology and security organization, and we brought in really talented people that have done this before. Our new technology leader did a full legacy mainframe conversion to cloud it \u2013 in its prior business in 18 months. Now, we\u2019re not going to do that quickly, but he\u2019s been there, done that, knows how to do it, he brought in a team to make it happen. So that\u2019s point number one. Point number two is just real rigor around the execution. We have very detailed plans. I\u2019ll try to give you a flavor of that on the call this morning. And you know the other flavor I try to give you is this like things are rolling. We started really this technology transformation in a big way, ramped up in the middle of last year, and we\u2019re starting to see the benefits of that, meaning, things are being delivered to the marketplace in the fourth quarter, the stuff happening \u2013 happened in January and February. So, real cadence of delivering these application upgrades. And third is really partnering with the very best. And we talk to a lot of the cloud providers and we use really all of them in different way, shape or form, but I think I highlighted in the call that we\u2019re really focused on partnering with Google, just because of their capabilities, the quality of their cloud, the depth of the cloud is really important to us. So people, real rigor in the process, John and I, and the leadership team, have a regular cadence of looking at the projects of how are they being delivered, are they on cost, are they on budget, are they on time? Okay they\u2019re installed; they\u2019re in the cloud onto the next one. So there\u2019s that kind of rigor around it. But we\u2019re on it is really the approach that I have and it starts with people. Manav Patnaik : All right. That\u2019s great. John Gamble : Manav, on your question to me, I just want to make sure I was clear. My commentary doesn\u2019t include the \u2013 any impact on the outcome of the regulatory or legal matters that are ongoing. Obviously, those would be on top of \u2013 those cash outflows will be on top of anything I just said. Manav Patnaik : Got it. Operator : And we\u2019ll move on to our next question from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Togut : Thank you. Good morning. Once you get to the end of Equifax 2020, where do you think you\u2019re going to be most differentiated versus your two primary competitors in terms of major product and service offerings? Mark Begor : Yes, it starts \u2013 to start with, we believe that our speed to market of both ingesting data more quickly, having it easier access by our customers and then really a differentiator is going to be speed of getting new products to market. Today, we\u2019re slower than we\u2019d like to be, for sure and that becomes a competitive disadvantage if your competitors are faster than you are and we really believe this is going to leapfrog in that element, and then the other is going to be costs. Moving these legacy applications to the cloud is we\u2019ve talked many times, we have multiple versions of the same application, we\u2019re going to consolidate to one, then we\u2019re going to move that to the cloud. And then when it\u2019s in the cloud, we can also leverage it across the 24 countries we operate in and not recreate it in each market that we\u2019re in, so that cost leverage is going to be a massive to us. And you actually touched on probably the third leg on this speed, cost, it\u2019s really going to be what are the features and having a differentiated access to our data could be revenue upside. Today, to access some of our multiple siloed database is doable. We have products that bridge across that and technology. When we have that single data fabric, we\u2019re convinced that that\u2019s going to allow our customers and us to really access the wide array of differentiated data we have more easily. David Togut : Understood. And then once you finish this transformation at the end of 2020, what does the Equifax growth model look like in terms of organic revenue growth, margin expansion, capital allocation, bottom-line growth? Mark Begor : Yes, David, you probably know from prior calls. We\u2019ve been crystal clear that we\u2019re not prepared to put a long-term framework back in place. We want to do that, we will do that, but there has been a couple of things that we\u2019ve been quite clear about that are going to be important to us to really get nailed down before we\u2019re prepared to do that. First is really seeing a path on our legal and regulatory settlement framework and we don\u2019t have a \u2013 we don\u2019t have that framework today. So that\u2019s the one that\u2019s important to us to have real clarity on for you and us before we put a long-term framework in place. Number two is really this technology plan and we\u2019re \u2013 we made massive progress in the last six months about getting this plan laid out. We still got some work to do around; really deeply quantifying the financial benefits on top and bottom line. So that\u2019s still on our to-do list, but that\u2019s something that we need to complete to put that inside of our long-term framework. And then third is really USIS, and really seeing some consistency of their return to growth. We\u2019ve seen positive performance kind of quarterly in 2018, that\u2019s been masked somewhat by the headwind that they have in the U.S. mortgage market, but seeing that consistency of recovery from USIS is important to us. So when those three are in place, we\u2019re going to be ready to put our long-term framework back out there. David Togut : Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Andrew Steinerman : Hi, Mark. Do you see Equifax\u2019s perspective revenue, organic revenue growth acceleration as a zero-sum situation? With the other credit bureaus or do you more see kind of unique offerings to Equifax during your sales pipeline and so really kind of just, I would say, growth opportunities to Equifax? Mark Begor : Andrew, as you know, it\u2019s probably a mix of the two. We compete hard just like the other guys do for business and we\u2019re out there doing it. We had competitive wins in the last couple of months that I would say you\u2019re \u2013 you could characterize them as zero-sum game. That\u2019s one where we move from secondary to primary, whatever, and our competitors are trying to do that to us every day, and that was happening before the breach and you and I have talked a couple of times during 2018. But there\u2019s some unique aspects of our business. When you think about our EWS business, that\u2019s one that\u2019s quite unique. Our competitors don\u2019t have a business like that, and that business growing at the rate it\u2019s growing. I wouldn\u2019t characterize that as a zero-sum game, because it\u2019s really different. You said it\u2019s different markets, et cetera, and our competitors have businesses that we don\u2019t compete with their segments. So, I would say it\u2019s a mix of the two. Andrew Steinerman : Okay. Thank you. John Gamble : The other place is international, right. Our international footprint very different than our competitors. So, our opportunity to grow there is different than theirs. Andrew Steinerman : Okay. Thank you very much. Mark Begor : Maybe, Andrew, just to add an example, I think we\u2019ve talked before in meetings with you and I about the FinTech space. That\u2019s an example, where it\u2019s a mix of the two. We historically didn\u2019t have the presence that we should have there. Our competitors were much more aggressive commercially. We changed that in 2018. But there is also the element that I talked about in my comments earlier of taking our TWN data assets to the FinTech space is something that\u2019s quite differentiated, our competitors don\u2019t have there. So that\u2019s a great example, where we hope to have some competitive wins in FinTech as we go into 2019, and we\u2019re working on it as we speak, but we\u2019re also bringing new data assets there that we\u2019re really just helping that customer set like others, improve their decisioning. Andrew Steinerman : Well said. Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Jeff Goldstein : Hi. This is Jeff Goldstein on for Toni. I know you\u2019ve previously talked about a $0.40 a share impact from ongoing IT and security, and increased insurance costs relates to the breach. Is that still the expectation baked into the 2019 guidance or has that number moved that all? Mark Begor : Yes. So, we\u2019re looking forward to 2019, a part of what\u2019s happened, right, part of what we\u2019ve talked about when we talk about the first quarter, we have increased security cost is because we\u2019re lapping the increase in those costs in 2019 from 2018. So, we\u2019re certainly seeing those increases and those increases are continuing and we would expect to see security costs continue to rise, but the \u2013 the very large increase that we saw during 2018 and the big one-time step-up in insurance costs, those things occurred in 2018. And so we shouldn\u2019t see the same type of step in 2019, but we will still incur those costs. Jeff Goldstein : Got it. And then understanding, you said CapEx will be flat year-over-year, but how should we be thinking about the run rate figure of that beyond 2020. Is it back to more like 5% of sales number that occurred before 2017 or is 9% of sales is a better way to think about it given kind of the new Equifax you\u2019re trying to create? Thanks. John Gamble : So, I think about all we can say at this point is when the transfer maintenance is complete; the CapEx numbers should certainly decline. To give you the exact number, it\u2019s way premature, but it should certainly decline. Mark Begor : And I think that also, Jeff, you kind of leading into our financial framework, which we\u2019re not prepared to talk about on a long-term basis, but I think John comment \u2013 the investment that we\u2019re making should result in that coming down in the future, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re prepared to talk about what that is yet. Jeff Goldstein : Got it. Thanks. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Kevin McVeigh : Great, thanks. Hey, you talked about being out of the penalty box with your customers, any sense of \u2013 what kind of the revenue lost on that was in 2018 versus 2017, so we can get a sense of what that opportunities as we scale back into 2019? John Gamble : Yes. I think you could probably do the math with USIS\u2019s historical growth rate was kind of pre-cybersecurity incident and where it was in 2018 adjourn, it was obviously quite significant. Mark Begor : You saw our growth and you saw our competitors\u2019 growth, right? So, there was a quite a significant difference, but for us to quantify specifically, that would be very difficult. Kevin McVeigh : Okay. And then just in terms of the legal and regulatory framework, any sense of from a timing perspective, when that all gets wrapped up? John Gamble : We put some expanded detail into our 10-K on our regulatory and legal matters, and I\u2019d encourage you to take a look at that disclosure in there, which has a lot of detail about where we stand on that. Kevin McVeigh : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll move on to our next question from Tim McHugh with William Blair. Please go ahead. Tim McHugh : Thanks. Just wanted to follow-up on the discussion of the technology, I guess. How is that plan that you laid out \u2013 did that change meaningfully after pricing came in, I guess, or just in the last three to six months that you kind of move forward with the process. Is that plan any different than in the past? Just trying to understand how it\u2019s developing? Mark Begor : Dramatically different. When you think about 2018, the first half of 2018, our focus was really on doing a lot of security remediation improvements and all that. And Bryson joined us, his team started to join us. He changed out about half of the team as we roll through the second half of 2018 and his focus was really on helping us refine a plan that is what we talked about today. So, it\u2019s \u2013 I would characterize it is dramatically different given his experience, his teams\u2019 experience, there are lessons learned of doing this before. He has really shaped the plan that we\u2019ve put in place. And again, we try to give you a flavor this morning that is detailed that there\u2019s real ownership around specific projects. It\u2019s not like nothing is going to happen between now and 2020, there\u2019s stuff happening every week, meeting deliverable to the marketplace, and I\u2019ll give you a lot of color on things moving in to the cloud in the fourth quarter, in December and January, just kind to keep pacing through. We\u2019ve got a very deliberate and very focused planned to really drive this transformation over the three-year period, but going forward, over the next 22 months in 2019 and 2020. Tim McHugh : Okay. And on the Verification business, that business seemed to get stronger, I think as you said, at year-end. And I know you talked about new record growth. So, two aspects to the question there. One is why has new record growth been as strong as it is? Are they finding different types of sources to get the data? And secondly, is there another factor, I guess, that maybe as it \u2013 are they new kind of use cases, are they really meaningfully moving the needle at this point in terms of the booking... Mark Begor : You hit both nails on the head, that\u2019s their business model. And you know, they\u2019ve invested heavily in their technology in the last 12 months or so to make it easier for what I would characterize the next year of companies to more easily connect to EWS and provide their data assets, so that\u2019s one, meaning that they\u2019re kind of mid-market customers or companies that have 1,000 employees or 2,000 employees versus 20,000, making it easier for them to commit. As we pointed out, we added more records in the fourth quarter than we have in last five years. I think it\u2019s similar on the number of companies that are now partnering meeting. We\u2019re really ramping that up. So that\u2019s point number one. And inside of that more record growth is just an increased focus in success on partnerships, where we\u2019re working with other payroll providers to have a partnership around getting data from that source as opposed to directly from the company. And then you hit the nail on the head the second side, which is more use cases, whether it\u2019s government that, it\u2019s one that grew for us strong double digits in 2018. We expect that to continue in 2019, meaning, above the average. And just other use cases as we continue to take that growing asset. And then lastly, as I mentioned, and you know this that when we added data \u2013 another data record there, another payroll record this afternoon, it monetized tomorrow morning. As just the hit rates go up, the monetization is very, very rapid as you grow that. So, we\u2019ve got a very strong focus and Rudy has a very strong team focused on adding those data assets, and of course, he\u2019s got vertical owners and commercial teams out there, building out how the data is used and how it can help in decisioning in lots of different industry segments. You guys \u2013 you know this is a great Equifax business. Tim McHugh : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Hey John, there is just an inherent difficulty in projecting pipeline conversion when you go through a situation, where you have whether it was like a gap and then you had to kind of restart projects and stuff like that. Where do you \u2013 how do you feel right now in terms of your ability to forecast their pipeline conversion given the pace of the sales that are going on in the implementations? John Gamble : Well, you\u2019re clearly correct. Right, as you look through 2018, our ability to forecast our revenue was not nearly as good as it\u2019s been historically. And I think we\u2019ve talked about quite consistently the fact that we expected it to be choppy, right. Our conversion was choppy and our ability to forecast that was choppy. But we feel a little better this quarter than we did last quarter, because if you take a look at fourth quarter performance, really that what we missed based \u2013 really heavily based on the mortgage market. And I go back out to the impact of the mortgage market, and we were fairly good in terms of the revenue forecast that we have for the company, a little bit of weakness \u2013 a little more weakness in Australia than we guess, but other than that, I think \u2013 but relatively good. So we feel a little better given the performance in the fourth quarter, but we also accept, one quarter does not a trend make. So we are focused on getting better. We think our pipeline conversions are improving. We saw way better conversions in sales of batch jobs in USIS in the fourth quarter. All things that give us comfort, that things are getting better and our predictability is improving. But we do caution people that still it\u2019s going to be choppy and it should be less choppy as we move through 2019 and as we get back toward the end of 2019 as Mark talked about with the expected improvement in performance, we\u2019re expecting to start feeling a lot more normal. We would hope as we get toward the end of 2019. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay, thanks. And then just \u2013 when you are trying to forecast the mortgage market, are you putting a certain inherent conservatism in there, just as we ran the MBA application index for quarter-to-date last night, it sort of looked like, if you just kind of carry that forward where we are. You would actually have much better mortgage, I guess you could call it \u2013 less of a headwind in the first quarter and much better pickup in the rest of the year. Is there something where just given your experience you\u2019re stepping that back a little bit? Mark Begor : So, we actually use inquiries. So, in theory, at what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re trending the actual inquiries we received, which I don\u2019t think you have access to. So, we \u2013 that\u2019s the index we use. And since we see all inquiries, we think that\u2019s probably relevant in period. So in period, that\u2019s the basis going forward. We use three or four different sources for a third-party input on what we expect to happen with the overall mortgage market, and then we trend the inquiries from that point going forward. So, it\u2019s not only mortgage origination that you\u2019re seeing, but we\u2019re also seeing the impact of whether people are shopping more or less and we try to build that into the forecast. We would really admit forecast in the mortgage market is difficult, it\u2019s difficult for \u2013 I think everybody, but certainly difficult for us. We think what we have is a reasonable trend and showing reasonable improvement, but obviously, if the mortgage market gets better, faster, we\u2019ll get the benefit of that, right. If it stays weaker, we\u2019ll see that as well, it\u2019s pretty direct. Shlomo Rosenbaum : All right. Thank you very much. And John, I just want to comment, it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve heard the CFO summarizes guidance by saying merge that all together. Mark Begor : You don\u2019t know John well enough then. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. George Tong : Hi, thanks. Good morning. You acquired DataX earlier in 3Q. Can you tell us what the organic growth was in USIS in the fourth quarter? Mark Begor : So, the impact of DataX was on the order of less than a point, right? George Tong : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. I\u2019d like to go back to ongoing data security and insurance costs in the business, you indicated that the step-up in 2019 should be smaller than in 2018. Can you quantify how much in ongoing breach-related costs are embedded into your 2019 guidance? John Gamble : So, we tried to give two numbers okay. We did indicate that we were going to see continued increases in security. We didn\u2019t try to quantify and this is our run rate, what\u2019s included in adjusted EPS. So, I didn\u2019t quantify a specific number and I think what I could say is, we reached run rate and we\u2019re probably now going to see more normal growth in security spend and security spend growth rates are high, right. So, you should expect to see us grow our security spend like \u2013 like many companies would, but not have the significant step-ups we saw in 2018. In terms of our other spend embedded in our technology transformation is obviously investments that certainly improved securities. So, we separately gave a number around the tech transformation spend of about $300 million this year, which is down slightly from 2000 \u2013 from 2018. That is not \u2013 that is not just security in anyway, but the security spend that\u2019s non-recurring would be embedded in that number. George Tong : Got it. Thank you. Mark Begor : Thanks, George. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Brett Huff with Stephens. Please go ahead. Brett Huff : Good morning, guys, and thanks for the additional detail on the strategic and tech plan. That\u2019s helpful. Two questions related to that. Number one is, as you go through that tech refresh or the tech transformation, it\u2019s substantial as you\u2019ve talked about, how do you interact with your clients on that, and I guess, I\u2019m thinking. If I\u2019m a client and I want to partake in some of this new technology, does it take me longer to test it or am I going along in testing it with you. How does that \u2013 does that elongate kind of somebody consuming a new product? That\u2019s question number one. And then number two, and I\u2019ll get off. Is there any \u2013 I know that you guys put a lot of thought in this. So have you dialed this into how management team or even a couple layers down are compensated related to that? So thanks for those thoughts. Appreciate it. Mark Begor : Yes, great question, Brett. First on the migration, you hit on the head that in some regards, that\u2019s the most challenging part of this process is moving your customers from a legacy platform to one of the new platforms and that\u2019s not new for us. We\u2019ve been doing that for a long time, because we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ve been constantly upgrading our technology. Our focus is to make it easy for our customers, to make sure that the new application is going to provide value-added services to them, and then we\u2019re going to work with them in their cycle. You know they\u2019re going to have specific cycles about when they\u2019re ready to make a migration or a change given their technology plan. So, we\u2019ll be \u2013 we are dialoguing. It\u2019s not a new muscle for us; we\u2019ve been doing it before with our customers and really working through that migration process going forward. On your second question around the incentives, you hit on a really important point. As you might imagine, you\u2019ve got a leadership team here, an organization that is incented to run and grow the business, but at the same time, we\u2019re going to change the tires on the car, whatever the right analogy is, doing a technology transformation. So, the answer is yes, we have put in some specific incentives with the leadership team around the EFX 2020 transformation. We think that\u2019s really important to have them aligned. With that, this massive project as well as aligned with our investors around that project going forward. And then lastly, that we put a security metric in place in our cash bonus plan in 2018, we\u2019re continuing that in 2019. We think that focus around the security incentive is the right one. I think you know we\u2019re the only companies out there that has this kind of a metric and the way it works is in \u2013 we\u2019ve got 3,000 people that are in our AIP bonus plan, and there is \u2013 the 25% of that bonus is tied to the organizations and individuals progress around security and it\u2019s only punitive. So meaning, if we don\u2019t meet our security goals, which we did last year, so there was no takeaway in 2018, but we don\u2019t meet them in 2019, there could be a metric there. Other big believer in aligning people and the organization around what our goals are. So, we\u2019ve got very good goals around growth and financial incentives. We\u2019ve got the security goal and then we\u2019ve added this EFX 2020 incentive to align the organization around this technology transformation. Brett Huff : Great. Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Billi Warmington : Good morning, everyone. Mark Begor : Hey, Bill. Billi Warmington : A question on the revenue pipeline. Last time when we talked, it was reaching a two-year high. I believe although you had mentioned it was heavily weighted towards the first and second stages of that pipeline. I just wanted to ask, how you would describe that pipeline in those terms today. Mark Begor : Yes, Bill. I don\u2019t remember saying a two-year high, but I probably did or one of us did. But there\u2019s no question of pipeline build through the year last year and that continued in the fourth quarter. I think John talked about our execution on deals in the fourth quarter. I know you\u2019re referring to USIS I believe in this, in your comments, which is what we\u2019ll address and that\u2019s continuing in the first quarter. We just have active dialogs. We feel like we\u2019re back to kind of normal commercial discussions, the security discussions, we\u2019re not having really anymore with our customers. Although, our customers continue to want to learn from us about what we\u2019re doing, when you\u2019re investing the amounts we are in security and technology, we\u2019re putting cutting edge stuff in. So there, we\u2019re doing a lot of best practice sharing which builds our relationship, our partnership with our customers. But as we continued in the first quarter, we see those pipelines continue to be quite strong; at the same time, we try to be clear on this call and prior calls that predicting the closure rate on those when you\u2019re still building pipelines versus a run rate pipeline that we had in September 2017 before the cybersecurity incident. And as you know, that kind of new deal pipeline in September 2017 went away and we\u2019ve been working hard to build that over the last 15, 16 months and continued positively, which is reflected in the guidance we tried to give for 2019 and how we see USIS progressing as it goes through the year. But again with that caution that this is hard to predict on when deals are actually going to close. So that\u2019s the one that we\u2019re not back to our normal ability as John mentioned a few minutes ago to really forecast how our yields are going to close inside USIS and that\u2019s still to come for us. Billi Warmington : And then as a follow-up question on the work numbers. You highlighted the very strong records growth nearing 90 million. What do you see as a total opportunity there and then how much are the match rate actually improving as a result of the higher records? Mark Begor : Yes. On the first half of your question, we just see a lot of opportunity. I use the term with you before and others on this call and I use it internally with Rudy and his team EWS. From my perspective, EWS is really in the second inning of their growth. And as you know, you own the business for a decade, a record growth in one of those. As you know, there\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t know what the right number is, something around 150 million non-farm payroll or 90 million, we\u2019ve got a lot of growth opportunity to grow our records and we talked about how that record growth was accelerating In the fourth quarter and through the latter parts of the year from our technology investments, partnerships we have. So, we expect record growth to continue and with the top-end on that, it\u2019s hard to say. But we\u2019re energized about the opportunity going forward. The second half of your question on the match rate, I don\u2019t know John, what that is? John Gamble : And quite honestly, given that the way we serve customers are so different by customer and by application, be difficult for me to give you an average. Just needless to say as Mark said, right, as the database grows, our ability to respond goes up and it\u2019s a significant benefit to us. Mark Begor : And again, I mentioned a couple of times on this call, the beauty of this business is that we had in that record today and it\u2019s monetized tomorrow. That\u2019s kind of the great thing about the business when you\u2019ve got a lot of use cases, whether it\u2019s mortgage or government or ticket and your hit rates go up, that means your revenue goes up. So, it\u2019s quite an exciting workforce. Billi Warmington : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Gary Bisbee : Yes. Hi, good morning. On the Equifax 2020 initiatives, I guess, you said you won\u2019t add back any of the costs beyond 2020. But is it safe to say the vast majority of the investment and changes completed by the end of 2020? And as part of that, would it be reasonable to think that you begin to see some benefits during the next two years if this happens or should we really think that the benefits really accrue beyond 2020, both on the ability to deliver stuff quicker to the customers in your internal innovation and the cost side? Thank you. John Gamble : We expect to make a lot of progress in the next couple of years, but in terms of the specific response to your question, we need to let some time pass. And yes, we do expect to see benefits as we move forward, right. We said we\u2019re going to see \u2013 we\u2019re going to see major changes move into the data fabric in 2019. That absolutely benefits us as we go into 2020, operationally, speed to market, a lot of different ways. So, we certainly do expect to see benefits. Financial benefits don\u2019t happen until you turn something off, right. Turning something on doesn\u2019t give you financial benefit, but turning it off does. So the turning it off part, so the financial benefit, that\u2019s a lot more starting in 2020. Mark Begor : Gary, I think we also try to give some color this morning with actually \u2013 when some things are happening, we try to spice them out as you know things that were installed in the fourth quarter, things are happening in the first quarter. So that is going to provide benefits. It\u2019s not a switch that\u2019s going to be switched on at the end of 2020. This is going to happen all the way through this timeframe and beyond 2020. The benefits are going to accrue from these significant investments. Gary Bisbee : Great. And then the follow-up. As both of you discussed the 2019 outlook and I appreciate all the commentary you provided. An awful lot of it sounds like it gets a lot better as the year goes on. I realize a bunch of that is comps and sort of market stuff around mortgage. But can you help us gauge your confidence just on the deliverability of what sounds like a much more back loaded and aggressive Q1 to Q4 ramp that you\u2019re talking about? Thank you. John Gamble : We tried Gary to give you some color. I think you got to be the judge on that too, but we\u2019re trying to give some color on the significant part of the comps on this, meaning, the cost in the first quarter versus the ramp rate that we had last year, the mortgage headwinds that we start to comp out on as we get into the second half. So, there is a big element of that. And at the same time, we gave a range that we were intentional about for revenue and EPS, because there are some uncertainties out there that we wanted to make sure you understood. At the same time, there\u2019s a number of our businesses, in particular, EWS that we have a lot of visibility and kind of clarity on, when you think about the headwinds in Australia for international and a lesser degree Argentina, and then the U.S. mortgage headwinds in United States, we try to \u2013 for USIS, we try to put a box around those of what we think is reasonable. But those have been proven to be hard to forecast for us in the last six to 12 months. And then you lay out the last factor on top of USIS, we think we\u2019ve got a good case here inside of the range that we provided, but we know that is less predictable today than it has been in the past. Gary Bisbee : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. And we\u2019ll move on to our last question for today from Jeff Meuler from Baird. Please go ahead. Nick Nikitas : Hey, guys. This is Nick Nikitas on for Jeff. Thanks for squeezing me in. So just coming back to the tech transformation timelines, really helpful detail and understandably, it sounds like there\u2019s a lot still going on. But just given it sounds like it will remain fairly intensive over the next 12 to 18 months. Can you just talk about how that\u2019s impacting the go-to-market opportunity? And Mark, you talked about multiple versions for an application. So is that in a dynamic that\u2019s still a somewhat material governor on new business or are we kind of past the peak point of headwinds and you\u2019re starting to see improvement there? Mark Begor : Yes. From our perspective, Nick, I would and John you should jump in. We don\u2019t see the tech transformation impacting our ability to grow. It\u2019s really going to be a positive going forward and we got focused and dedicated technology teams. We\u2019ve ramped up a lot more resources there. So, this is focused, the teams that are working on it are working on it. Our commercial teams are just doing what they should do every day, out there selling. Now, they\u2019ll have a role when we get ready to use the migrations of working with our technology team, with our customers, technology team and their counterparts inside of our customers, but I don\u2019t see this having an impact on impeding growth in anyway. And the other element is, when we talk to customers, you think about, if you\u2019re going to be partnering with someone, who is going to make this kind of investment in their infrastructure, we\u2019re doing it for our customers. So, it becomes a very positive dialog about the partnership with our customers. They\u2019re quite positive about what we\u2019re doing on technology, what we\u2019re doing on data analytics, the ability for them to more easily access the data, this becomes an easier commercial discussion about doing things this week and next week, because of the kind of partner we\u2019re going to be long-term for them when we complete elements in this EFX 2020 transformation. John Gamble : And as we said in the past, right, I mean, the thing that we \u2013 that we just have to keep in mind and focus on is the fact that when you add this much additional activity, right, it does create more complexity. So, as Mark said, we\u2019re focused on making sure that it doesn\u2019t impede the way we\u2019re able to deliver, but it\u2019s also a significant challenge for our team that they have to stay very focused on, because when you\u2019re going through a transformation and adding this much resource to try to do it at pace that it absolutely will impact your \u2013 it does create more complexity in your processes and just something we have to work through. Nick Nikitas : Okay. That makes sense. And just a quick one on the mortgage. I think, Mark, you mentioned some shift in the reseller end market. Can you just talk about what that was and if it\u2019s incorporated to the end-market forecast you guys outlined or I guess it will be slightly incremental? Mark Begor : Yes. That\u2019s just \u2013 in our business, we used go-to-market in two different ways in mortgage. We have mortgage solutions, where we actually sell the tri-merge report, we take our reports, combine it with our competitors and sell the report or \u2013 and/or we simply sell our report to somebody, who does that combination so, to a reseller. And we are just talking about that we see \u2013 we have seen shifts \u2013 channel shifts in and out of our core mortgage business as we move through the year. And as we get into 2019, we\u2019re probably going to see continued channel shifts. We would expect probably away from us in core mortgage in the first half. Nick Nikitas : Okay. But all of that\u2019s included in kind of the end market forecast of\u2026 Mark Begor : It is, it is absolutely, because that doesn\u2019t change the number of inquiries. It just changes what we deliver, yes. Nick Nikitas : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. Mark Begor : Great. Thank you very much. John Gamble : Thanks everybody. Trevor Burns : Thanks everybody. Operator : And this does conclude today\u2019s presentation. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Equifax First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Trevor Burns. Please go ahead. Trevor Burns : Thanks, and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Trevor Burns, Investor Relations. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com. During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements including second quarter and full year 2019 guidance, to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risk factors, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC including our 2018 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. Also, we'll be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. For the first quarter of 2019, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes costs associated with the realignment of internal resources and other activities, acquisition-related amortization expense, the income tax effects of stock awards, recognized upon vesting or settlement, and foreign currency losses from re-measuring the Argentinian peso denominated net monetary assets. Adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax also excludes an accrual for legal matters related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident, legal and professional fees related to the cybersecurity incident, principally fees related to our outstanding litigation and government investigations as well as the incremental non-recurring project costs designed to enhance our technology and data security. This includes project costs to implement systems and processes to enhance our technology and data security infrastructure, as well as the projects to replace and substantially consolidate our global network and systems as well as the cost to manage these projects. These projects that will transform our technology infrastructure and further enhance our data security were incurred throughout 2018 and are expected to occur in 2019 and 2020. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to Equifax adding back interest expense, net of interest income, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization and also as is the case for adjusted EPS, excluding an accrual for legal matters related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident. Costs related to 2017 cybersecurity incident costs associated with the realignment of internal resources and other activities, and foreign currency losses from re-measuring the Argentinian peso denominated net monetary assets. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our website. In addition to the non-GAAP measures that we posted on our website, we will post after this call certain supplemental financial information on our website, to better help you understand our business. Included with the supplemental information is historical actual, and 2019 forecast U.S. mortgage market inquiries. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark. Mark Begor : Thanks, Trevor and good morning everyone. As you could see from our press release this morning this has been a busy quarter for us particularly during the past few weeks and days. We're pleased with our start to 2019 with strong progress on our strategic priorities and our financial results were within the guidance we provided in February, while we are continuing to return USIS to a growth mode, we're executing well against our EFX 2020 initiatives. Before I get into a discussion of our first quarter financial results and the business units, let me spend a few minutes discussing the $690 million charge we took this quarter related to outstanding litigation and potential fines related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident. We delayed our earnings discussion until this morning because we've made significant progress on our legal and regulatory settlements in the past few weeks. As you know we've been in active discussions for months related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident and those discussions accelerated in the past month. Importantly, the $690 million accrual we booked includes our estimate of probable losses associated with our global settlement discussions with certain federal and state regulators as well as the federal class action cases. We recently reached confidential settlement terms in the consumer federal class action cases, that upon approval by the court, will resolve and dismiss the claims asserted in the consumer cases. The proposed global settlement provides for the establishment of a single consumer redress fund which was our goal and certain other non-monetary terms. As we've discussed previously, we believe the consumers are better served through a single consumer fund and a global settlement of the federal and state government investigations together with the consumer class action litigation. We expect to complete definitive settlement agreements with the parties in the coming weeks. While this charge represents our current estimate to resolve many of the significant issues facing the company, we expect to incur additional losses associated with the other claims and litigation related to the 2017 incident. We will continue to work with all parties to bring these matters to closure as soon as possible, while balancing the needs of our company, employees, customers, and shareholders. As you know we've prepared ourselves financially for the settlement by strengthening our balance sheet, including suspending our stock buyback, and freezing our dividend in 2017. This settlement will not have an impact on our internal investment plans, new product introductions, our $1.25 billion EFX 2020 technology and security program or our plans to grow and expand Equifax with acquisitions. This is a positive step forward for Equifax as we work to put the 2017 cybersecurity event behind us. Let me now move to our financial results. We're pleased with our start to the year as our first quarter financial results were consistent with the guidance we gave you in February with revenue in the middle and adjusted EPS at the top of the range provided. Revenue at $846 million was up almost 1% in constant currency. Foreign exchange further weakened during the quarter relative to our February guidance impacting revenue negatively by just under $2 million. During the quarter, U.S. mortgage market inquiries again declined meaningfully, down 10% but were better than our projection of down 13%. Excluding the almost 2% negative mortgage market impact total constant currency revenue growth was 2.5% and we were pleased with that. Overall, our combined U.S. B2B businesses, USIS, and EWS performed better than our expectations, both benefiting relative to expectations due to the mortgage market with U.S. also delivering nice growth in offline revenue and EWS delivering very strong Verification Services revenue growth. EWS saw weakness in Employer Services revenue which impacted overall growth. International revenue was only marginally weaker than our expectations as somewhat weaker than expected revenue in Australia was mostly offset by stronger revenue in Canada. And GCS was a bit weaker than we expected driven by lower U.S. subscriber growth. This weaker than expected GCS revenue was -- offset the better than expected performance in U.S. B2B. Adjusted EPS of $1.20 per share was on the top end of the guidance we provided in February. In the first quarter, total non-recurring or one-time cost related to the cybersecurity incident in our transformation exclusive of the accruals for legal matters related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident were $97 million and consistent with our expectations. This includes $83 million of technology and security spending, $12 million for legal and investigative fees, and $2 million for consumer support. We continue to expect 2019 one-time cost related to the cybersecurity incident and transformation exclusive of any legal accruals to be about $350 million. Now for some comments on the business units. USIS revenue was down almost 3% on a reported basis as we expected compared to last year with USIS up about 50 basis points excluding over three percentage point negative impact of the mortgage market on revenue. And that 50 basis point increase ex mortgage was quite positive from our perspective. In the quarter, we also saw a mix shift in our mortgage business with transaction shifting towards our reseller channel. This also negatively impacted USIS revenue by over 1% in the quarter. Adjusting for both of these factors non-mortgage revenue growth was up almost 1.5%, a positive sign of continued improvement by USIS and was slightly better than our expectations for the quarter. Our new USIS leader, Sid Singh is driving a new level of energy and accountability with our customers in the USIS team. Inside of USIS, Mortgage Solutions was down 23% in the quarter, given the decline in the overall mortgage market and due to the mix shift with mortgage resellers, which occurred in fourth quarter 2018. Our USIS mortgage revenue can be impacted by movements between our 3-Bureau business in Mortgage Solutions and selling a single file to a mortgage reseller, which is included in our online business. We manage our Mortgage Solutions 3-Bureau business such that it\u2019s dollar profit contributions exceeds the dollar profit of a single file to the reseller. Mix shift had negative impact of over 1% in USIS revenue growth in the first quarter while USIS operating profit was not materially impacted. We expect the revenue headwind from the mortgage mix shift to continue for the remainder of 2019. Financial Marketing Services was up about 6% driven by new deal wins. This is the first time we've seen growth in FMS since prior to the cybersecurity incident. While we are encouraged by the growth in FMS this quarter, the timing of closing deals is still not as predictable as it was prior to the cybersecurity incident, which may impact the timing of future revenue in \u2013 it may impact the timing of revenue in future quarters. Online was down 1% but was up 2% excluding the mortgage market impact. While online did benefit from the mortgage market mix I previously discussed. This was partially offset by a decline in our direct-to-consumer revenue, which is revenue we generate with the other bureaus. Online was also benefited from continued growth in our Telecom & Utilities verticals. In terms of customers, we're selling across the portfolio of USIS customers and we should start to continue to see those benefits from these commercial engagement in the second half of 2019. Our pipeline of new business continues to grow positively. We continue to believe that our differentiated data assets in USIS coupled with our technology investments will return the business to its traditional growth mode, but remain cautious on the pace of the recovery. We're confident in the USIS growth plan for 2019. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins of 42.9% were down 120 basis points from first quarter 2018, primarily driven by lower fixed leverage as revenue declined in the quarter and additional investments in security and data analytics to drive new product. Partially offsetting these margin declines, USIS continued to effectively manage their SG&A cost reducing both the dollars and percent of revenue from the fourth quarter restructuring that we did. Shifting now to Workforce Solutions they had a very strong quarter with revenue up 9%. Verification Services delivered very strong results with revenue up 16% driven by strong double-digit growth across health care, talent solutions, auto and government. EWS like USIS was also impacted by a decline in the overall mortgage market, which negatively impacted revenue by about 2.5 percentage points. Overall, EWS revenue excluding the negative mortgage market impact grew almost 11%, which we were very pleased with. Employer Services declined in the quarter down almost 4%, driven principally by tax management services given low unemployment levels and to a lesser extent Workforce Analytics and our ACA business talent solutions and our I-9 and onboarding businesses. Also saw growth in the quarter which we expect to continue throughout the year. We expect Employer Services revenue to be down for the full year consistent with the levels we saw in the first quarter. The strong verifier revenue growth resulted from -- in a very strong adjusted EBITDA margins of 49.4% and expansion in the quarter of 50 basis points. EBITDA margin growth was slightly offset by investments in sales resources to support incremental revenue growth activities. EWS continues to be a great Equifax franchise and positioned for a very strong 2019. International revenue was down 8% on a reported basis and up 2.5% in local currency, but slightly below our expectations. The slower growth continues to be driven by the weak consumer and commercial lending markets in Australia that started to soften late in the third quarter of last year and to a lesser extent the ongoing weak economic conditions in Argentina. We expect the Australia and Argentina markets to remain weak through the bulk of 2019 although the revenue growth impacts will begin to lessen in the second half of 2019 as we approach the periods of their initial declines in the third quarter of 2018 in Australia and the second quarter of 2018 in Argentina. Our Latin America businesses grew mid single-digits in local currency in first quarter despite the continued headwinds in Argentina. Revenue growth was driven by double-digit constant currency growth in Chile and Ecuador and high single-digit constant currency growth in Paraguay and Uruguay. Our Latin America franchises continue to benefit from the expansion of Ignite, InterConnect SaaS and strong NPI rollouts in both 2017 and 2018. I was in Peru earlier this week meeting with our team and key customers. Our European business in the U.K. and Spain grew mid-single digits in local currency in the first quarter 2019. We saw a mid-single-digit local currency growth in our European credit operations and low single-digit growth in our European debt management business. I'll be in Madrid and London next week meeting with customers and investors. Canada delivered another strong quarter with high single-digit growth in local currency in the first quarter consistent with the full year revenue growth rate of 8%, we saw in 2018 reflecting a strong focus on customer innovation and new products. We're excited about the benefits our technology transformation will have in Canada. In the first quarter, we migrated our first Canadian customer into InterConnect in the public cloud. We also completed a small bolt-on acquisition in Montr\u00e9al JLR that brings unique real estate data assets to Equifax in Canada. Asia Pacific which is predominantly Australia for us declined 2.5% in local currency in the first quarter, principally related to the weakening we began to see in the third quarter last year in Australia consumer lending, particularly in mortgage and other consumer and commercial credit markets on Australia. Although, only one-month data in April, we began to see signs of market bottoming in Australia, we expect second quarter to also see revenue declines but Australia should return to growth in the second half particularly with easier comparisons to last year in the second half. Despite the strong headwinds in Australia we are encouraged by the growth potential. We continue to win top customers particularly in telco and we continue to hold a substantial data advantage in the Australian market. As we mentioned last year, the move to positive data in Australia continues to progress well. At the end of April, just over 50% of the consumer account that have been shared \u2013 have been shared and we expect to have over 80% by the end of the third quarter this year. Incorporating positive data will allow us to develop new products for our customers, as well as enable new use cases. For example, incorporating positive data into portfolio management solutions, we believe provides more predictive outcomes than just using negative data. I'll also be in Australia in the next few weeks to spend time with the team and customers. International adjusted EBITDA margins at 25.3% were down 410 basis points in the first quarter, principally reflecting lower margins Australia and Latin America, driven by Argentina. We expect growth in international to improve in the second quarter and improve significantly in the second half. Second quarter will be driven by stronger growth in Canada and Latin America and in the second half growth returns to Asia-Pacific, with easier comparisons. We believe this improved growth along with some additional cost reductions taken not only in the fourth quarter, but in the first quarter will significantly improve margins in the second half. Shifting now to Global Consumer Solutions. Their revenue declined almost 9% on a reported basis and 8% in local currency basis in the first quarter and this decline was greater than our expectations. Our global consumer direct business was down about 20% and was just over 40% of total GCS revenue. As we discussed throughout 2018, our U.S. consumer direct business saw revenue declines about 20% as a result of our suspension of U.S. consumer advertising in the fourth quarter of 2017 after the cybersecurity incident. GCS began limited direct marketing to U.S. consumers in the fourth quarter, which continued into the first quarter and we're starting to see subscriber growth from our restarted marketing a good sign as we begin 2019. We also continuing to invest in our new consumer platform and are rolling out our myEquifax consumer portal and seeing growth in myEquifax members. We expect to see U.S. subscriber growth as the year unfolds. Our GCS partner businesses which are almost 60% of total GCS revenue delivered mid single-digit growth in the quarter. And ID Watchdog grew double-digits in the quarter, which we expect that growth to continue in 2019. We expect GCS revenue to be down in second quarter at levels similar to the first quarter. However, starting in third quarter as we lap the periods where the consumer direct revenue began to stabilize in 2018, we expect to see revenue to return to flat and begin to grow in the second half as we move through the remainder of the year and into 2020. Adjusted GCS EBITDA margins declined as expected in the first quarter as we saw the effective revenue loss and an increase in advertising. However, margins were up nicely on a sequential basis from fourth quarter 2018 reflecting the sequential revenue growth. We expect margins in GCS in the second quarter to remain in the low-20s. However, we expect margins to increase in the second half as we see the benefit from stable to growing revenue driven by our return to consumer marketing and growing partner revenue as well as some cost actions that we took in the fourth quarter and some additional cost actions we took in the first quarter. Shifting now to technology, our technology transformation. In the last call, we laid out detailed plan for our $1.25 billion EFX 2020 technology transformation for 2018 and 2020. We're convinced that our technology transformation will differentiate our products and our ability to deliver them by combining unique data assets, analytics and leading technology. It will also accelerate the speed of our products to market and the ease of which they're consumed and reduce our costs as we move our data and applications to the cloud. We're on plan with our timeline to be completed with most major activities in our EFX 2020 transformation program by late -- by the end of next year. We'll be posting after this call as we did in the first quarter, our quarterly technology plan milestones for 2019 in our Investor Relations deck. Let me give you some commentary on where we stand with our major technology plan tracks through the first quarter. First, our data fabric is being built on the Google Cloud platform in a virtual private cloud environment utilizing GCP native tooling. Our data fabric will fundamentally make it easier for -- to bring our unique assets together including customer data to create new products and solutions for our customers. Our data fabric pattern is now in place at Google Cloud -- in the Google Cloud platform and our USIS, EWS, Canadian and corporate teams are working actively on migrating the U.S. consumer credit, The Work Number and Canadian consumer credit exchanges to our new cloud fabric. Establishing our data fabric pattern at GCP was delayed from our original planning. However, we remain on track to migrate several of our other U.S. and EWS exchanges including NCTUE, IXI, DataX, I-9 and unemployment claims as well as Ignite to the common data fabric by the end of this year. Beginning in the third quarter, any new data sets will be directly ingested into this new cloud-based data fabric. So a very strong progress on this first priority for us in our EFX 2020 transformation. Second, building on the latest suite of InterConnect and Ignite native -- and Ignite cloud native product offerings, we are using reusable application in cloud native services to rebuild our customer applications. Over the past year Equifax has worked to migrate these applications to a virtual private cloud using cloud native services. We completed production implementations of Ignite Direct and InterConnect in a virtual private cloud in all global regions. We expect to complete the integration of Ignite and InterConnect app services in our VPCs this quarter to allow customers to seamlessly promote attributes and models defined in Ignite, including those driven by machine learning into production on interconnect. These services should be broadly available by the end of the second quarter. Third, we will migrate customers from legacy decisioning systems, interface systems, and Ignite instances to Ignite and Ignite product suite. Over the course of 2019 and 2020, we expect to migrate the vast majority of our customers to our next generation InterConnect and Ignite cloud applications. In USIS, we are on track to migrate approximately half of these customers by the end of this year with the balance of the customers migrated during 2020. The technology and business teams are focused on deploying standard industry solution sets that will both productize this Ignite + InterConnect service and make the migration experience as frictionless as possible for our customers. Last, we'll migrate our global consumer systems and customer and consumer support systems using standard application services and cloud native services and operate them in the private cloud. Our new consumer system, Renaissance, that will include digital consumer support, is in the process of being migrated to a virtual private cloud environment using cloud native services. We expect to launch the first phase with EWS in the third quarter. Separately, we are deploying Salesforce in an integrated Genesys Google contact center AI solution for customer and call center support worldwide. We expect significant deployment of all this system to be ongoing through the third quarter with consistently -- consistent quarterly releases thereafter. I hope this gives you a sense of our intense focus and positive progress we have on making our technology transformation that will deliver new cloud-based technology to our customers. We're excited about the strong technology team that Bryson Koehler has built in the past nine months and all of these actions are being executed consistent with our commitment to be a leader in data, analytics, and cloud-based technology. We continue to be convinced this investment will differentiate Equifax and move us back to a growth and market-leading position. We made good progress in the first quarter and will continue our focused efforts in 2019 and 2020. Shifting now, M&A remains an important avenue of growth in Equifax and is one of the key elements of our strategy for the future. Last month you saw that USIS closed the acquisition of PayNet, a leader in commercial lending data and insights. We're excited at add PayNet in the team to Equifax. Their proprietary commercial leasing and loan data enables commercial finance and lending institutions to improve credit analytics on business credit underwriting and portfolio reviews. PayNet complements our existing commercial database that includes trade line information on short-term loans with longer term loans and leasing payment data, a very unique commercial data asset. Customer reaction on the acquisition is very positive and integration is proceeding quickly. USIS revenue was not benefited in the first quarter by the PayNet acquisition. We expect the contribution to USIS revenue growth to be about 1.5% in the second quarter from the PayNet acquisition. Next on new product innovation that continues to be a key component of our strategy and a core strengths at Equifax. We have an active pipeline of new product innovations with over 110 new products at various stages in the funnel and we expect to launch over 50 new products in 2019, a pace similar to each of the past three years. We're starting to see an increase in new product deployments in USIS. In the first quarter, USIS launched seven new products, which will start to generate revenue later this year, but have greater opportunities for revenue growth in 2020 and 2021. As we have discussed, we expect NPI revenue in 2019 will be below historic levels in the U.S. However, this is a positive sign as U.S. collaborates with customers and returns to a growth mode with their new product integrations. In the first quarter, USIS launched a new Insight Score for Personal Loans, which developed in collaboration with FinTechs is a risk score optimized to help lenders evaluate applications taking unsecured personal loans. The Insight Score for Personal Loans uses advanced modeling techniques by combining Equifax' unique data assets from telecommunications utility and trended data using patented explainable machine learning capabilities to cover a broad spectrum of consumer profiles for personal loans. The new Insight Score for Personal Loans is a win for Fintech companies and consumers as we help lenders develop greater predictive power and improve accuracy when evaluating applicants within or no credit files. While M&A and NPI are core to our long-term strategy, we believe partnering opportunities are another avenue to deliver revenue growth at Equifax. As you recall in March, we announced a strategic partnership agreement with FICO to launch the Data Decisions Cloud, an integrated end-to-end data and analytics suite that addresses key risk -- key needs across risk marketing and fraud to enable financial institutions to meet the needs of consumers faster and more precisely than ever before. While we continue to focus on embedding our Ignite + InterConnect platforms with customers, this is an example -- the FICO partnership is an example of using partnerships to extend our reach. You'll see more partnerships to extend our distribution as we move through 2019. We also expect to identify additional areas to partner with FICO on as we continue to work closely with them. I'm very energized about what the FICO partnership means for our financial institutions and consumers. So wrapping up. We've made several big and positive steps forward in our drive back to market leadership and growth during the first quarter. First, we're pleased with our continued progress with our global settlement discussions with certain federal and state regulators as well as the federal class action lawsuits. We expect these settlements to be completed in the coming weeks and include a single consumer fund. We are also pleased to reach confidential terms in the U.S. consumer class action lawsuits. As you know, we've been preparing for this settlement and we have the financial structure to absorb it, while continuing to invest in the growth of Equifax internally and externally via acquisitions including new products and our $1.25 billion EFX 2020 investment in security program. This is a positive step forward as we work to put the 2017 cybersecurity event behind us. Second, financially and operationally, we're pleased with our start to the year. USIS has a new level of energy under Sid Singh. The team is under front feet with customers with pipelines and commercial activity growing positively. EWS had a very strong quarter and is positioned for a very strong 2019. We are watching our international business closely, particularly with the Australian economy. Third, we continue to invest in strategic acquisitions to expand our data assets including the PayNet acquisition we announced last week. Fourth, we continue to focus intensely on our EFX 2020 technology and transformation plans that will move our data and applications to the cloud. We believe the investment will deliver speed, growth, and reduce cost, and differentiate us from our competitors. We'll continue to share our progress on EFX 2020 during the rest of the year and in 2020. Fifth, we continue to focus on expanding partnerships. In this quarter, we launched our new strategic partnership with FICO that brings unique data assets, technology, and analytics to our customers to help them grow faster. You'll see further expansion of partnerships from Equifax as we move to 2019. And then we also continue to focus on new products which -- with strong collaboration with customers. As I pass the one year mark at EFX, I'm more confident than ever that we are moving Equifax in the right direction with positive progress on all fronts. We're investing at record levels to make Equifax a market leader in data, analytics, and technology, and security. We know that we still have a lot of work to do. We're excited about the opportunity ahead. John will share more detail, but we're also committing to our prior guidance for 2019. We are confident in our path forward and expect continued positive progress in 2019. With that let me turn it over to John. John Gamble : Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I will generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on the GAAP basis, but will refer to non-GAAP results as well. As Mark covered our overall results, the business unit details, I'll cover overall margins, some corporate items, free cash flow, and our guidance. For all of 2019, U.S. mortgage market increase are expected to decline about 2% versus 2018 which is stronger than the down 5% we had expected in February. 1Q 2019 inquiries were down 10% versus the 13% we had expected in February increases in 2Q 2019 are expected to be down about 1% to be about flat in 3Q 2019 and slightly positive in 4Q 2019. In the first quarter, we extended the resource realignment activities, principally in Australia, the U.K., and GCS that we began in 4Q 2018 that further improve our cost structure. Related to these activities, we incurred an $11 million charge in 1Q 2019. Total savings from the two combined actions are expected to exceed $60 million in 2019 with second half 2019 savings exceeding the first half by about $10 million. In the first quarter, general corporate expense was $833 million excluding the non-recurring costs associated with the 2017 cybersecurity incident and technology transformation and the cost associated with the realignment of internal resources the adjusted general corporate expense for the quarter was $74 million, up $9 million from 1Q 2018. This was about $5 million better than we had expected. The increase versus 1Q 2018 predominantly reflects the increased investment in security and transformation and related technology as we ramp these costs in the first half of 2018 and increased variable compensation given the timing of hiring certain executives last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.5% in 1Q 2019, down 300 basis points from 1Q 2018 and in line with our expectations. As we discussed in February and as discovered in Mark's remarks, the decline in adjusted EBITDA margins year-to-year is principally about two-thirds in BUs, about half in GCS reflecting the lower consumer revenue and return to consumer advertising that Mark discussed, a quarter in USIS as declines in revenue impact fixed leverage and a quarter in international again principally as revenue declines impacted fixed leverage. About one-third was increased corporate cost in 1Q 2019 as I just covered. The BUs continue to do a very good job managing SG&A. For 1Q, 2019 the effective tax rate used in calculating adjusted EPS was 24.1% in line with our guidance. We continue to expect our calendar year 2019 tax rate used for adjusted EPS to be about 24.5% with 2Q slightly higher than this level. In 1Q 2019, operating cash flow was $31 million compared to $120 million in 1Q 2018. The decline was driven by the following items several of which are one-time in nature : 1Q 2018 -- in 1Q 2018 Equifax received $35 million in insurance proceeds offsetting costs incurred related to the cybersecurity incident. Equifax received no proceeds in 1Q 2019. Investments in security and transformation of $97 million were up $18 million on 1Q 2018. Employee variable compensation for 2018 paid in 1Q 2019 exceeded the levels paid in 1Q 2018 for 2017 the year in which no bonuses were paid to the CEO and senior staff by about $15 million. And payments in 1Q 2019 related to the $57 million of charges taken in 4Q 2018 and 1Q 2019 for cost-reduction actions were about $11 million. Capital spending or the cost of capital projects that was incurred in 1Q 2019 of $95 million was up $38 million from 1Q 2018 as we ramp investment in the cloud capabilities Mark described earlier. The capital spending is aligned with our estimate of $365 million for 2019. Capital expenditures which are equal to capital spending plus the net change in payables related to capital spending were $115 million in 1Q 2019 as activity that completed just prior to year-end was not paid until January. We do not expect similar large decreases in capital-related payables to occur in the remainder of 2019. The negative free cash flow we saw in the first quarter reflected this high level of capital expenditures. Excluding any payments related to settlements of litigation of regulatory actions as we look forward, we expect to deliver positive free cash flow in each of the remaining quarters of 2019 and for 2019 free cash flow to exceed $200 million. Now turning to our guidance for 2Q 2019 and 2019. For 2Q 2019, we expect revenue to be $865 million to $880 million, up 0.5% to 2.5% in constant currency. FX is expected to negatively impact revenue by 2.5%. Adjusted EPS is expected to be 1.32 to 1.37 per share. FX is expected to impact adjusted EPS negatively by about $0.035 per share. In February, we provided some perspective on the factors impacting 2019 resulting in an unusual seasonal pattern for Equifax and overall negatively impacting both 1Q and 2Q 2019. Impacting revenue in the first half of 2019 were market factors including the U.S. mortgage markets, Australian credit markets and Argentinian economic weakness and expected GCS revenue declines in the first half. In February, we had expected that in total these factors would impact 1Q 2019 revenue by about $30 million and would continue to impact revenue in 2Q 2019 although to a lesser degree. In 1Q 2019 although the U.S. mortgage market was about 3% better than expected, GCS which declined about $8 million and to a lesser extent Australia were weaker than expected offsetting this benefit. In 2Q 2019 in line with our February view, we expect these factors to impact revenue by over $15 million. Again, although the U.S. mortgage market is now expected to only decline slightly, GCS will be down more than previously expected at about the same levels as 1Q 2019. International is still being impacted by Australian credit market weakness. FX is also negative to revenue versus our February view by about $5 million. Impacting operating profit and EPS in the first half of 2019 were profit impacts of the revenue impacting factors and higher corporate costs in first half 2019 relative to first half 2018. As we indicated in February, the higher corporate costs reflect the significant ramp up in security and related technology costs in 2018 that did not reach their run rate until the second half of 2018. Also higher equity and variable comp in 2018 relative to 2017 and increased spending on data and analytics. In 1Q 2019, these factors impacted operating profit by approximately $30 million, as expected as lower cost corporate cost increases were offset by greater impact from GCS. In 2Q 2019, we expect these factors to impact operating profit by over $15 million. Although mortgage market impact will be minimal and much less than anticipated in February, GCS operating profit will have a negative impact that will be greater than expected. Increased corporate costs principally in security and related technology and data and analytics as well as lower Australia operating profit will continue to impact 2Q 2019 as we had expected. The 2Q 2019 tax rate and interest expense are expected to be consistent with the guidance we provided in February specifically that our 2019 tax rate for adjusted EPS is expected to be just over 24.5% and that quarterly interest expense is expected to be approximately $2 million reflecting our May 2018 bond issue. The combination of the over $15 million impact to operating profit as well as the increased interest expense and expected 24.5% tax rate, principally explain the year-to-year decline in adjusted EPS in the second quarter of 2019. Our full year 2019 guidance for Equifax revenue and EPS are unchanged from the previous guidance we provided in February with revenue between $3.425 billion $3.525 billion and adjusted EPS between $5.60 and $5.80 per share. Revenue improvements from the acquisition of PayNet and a smaller decline in the U.S. mortgage market are principally offset by a decline in expected GCS revenue, a somewhat deeper decline in the Australian credit markets impacting international revenue and negative FX to revenue of about 0.5% since our February view. This change in revenue mix negative to margin operating profit. Our actions to manage cost will allow us to maintain our adjusted EPS guidance as well as the year-over-year improvement in BU EBITDA margins. Our guidance for 2019 implies that our second half performance will be stronger than the normal sequential pattern in both revenue and operating profit. This is principally driven by non-mortgage growth in USIS, as well sequential growth across all regions international. We expect EWS to continue the strong year-to-year growth that they will show in the first half of 2019 into the second half and we expect GCS to return to year-to-year growth in the second half of 2019. In terms of operating profit, we expect all the use to show stronger than normal sequential operating profit growth in the second half. This is driven by the stronger sequential revenue growth in USIS and international. This is also driven by the cost reductions executed over the last two quarters that will benefit sequential margins in international as well as GCS and workforce. Delivering this performance requires, we continue strong execution across our team as well as continued focus on firmly managing cost throughout 2019. And with that, operator we'll now open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Manav Patnaik : Thank you. Good morning. Mark just first on the legal settlement. Can you just help frame for us the remaining cases? Like is this $690 million basically take care of I don't know 90% of the issues or so forth? Just wanted some color there. Mark Begor : Yes. Thanks Manav. As you heard me earlier mentioned we're not prepared to talk about which settlements are included here and which are not, but that we were trying to be clear that included the significant issues facing the company our expectation is in the coming weeks as I also mentioned earlier in the call, we'll have some real clarity around that once we finalize the discussions that are actively underway. John Gambler : And Manav they'll be quite a bit of disclosure in the 10-Q that will be filed later today. Manav Patnaik : Okay, got it. And then John if I could just follow-up on some color on the guidance in terms of the total M&A contribution. I know Mark just called out PayNet, but what was that contribution from M&A this quarter and then for the full year I guess? John Gambler : Yes, the contribution for M&A this quarter was relatively small, right? Really the most substantial contribution was DataX and it's less than $5 million in the period. And then we had some other very small acquisitions in international and very small acquisitions in EWS, none of which were material in any way. Manav Patnaik : And for the full year? John Gambler : The full year we gave a view for PayNet. As you get into the second half, the substantial impact for Equifax of acquisitions is really just PayNet because we start to wrap around the period in which we bought DataX as we get into early in the third quarter. Mark Begor : I think I said Manav in my comments that we expect PayNet to add 1.5% to USIS in the second quarter. Manav Patnaik : Yes, got it. All right. Thank you guys. Mark Begor : Thanks. Operator : We'll now hear from George Mihalos with Cowen. George Mihalos : Hey, good morning, guys. Nice to see the progress on the settlement side. I guess maybe Mark two things to kind of kick it off. First, you sounded upbeat about the pipeline, maybe you can provide a little bit of color if that's vertical -- anything vertical specific or if you're having a lot more success maybe leveraging the workforce and winning new business. And then understand that financial marketing is probably going to be a bit choppier. But it's nice to see the 6% growth. Should we expect that to be now be positive throughout the course of the year, or will there continue to be some variability? Mark Begor : Yes, I think on the last one that's one that I tried to be clear in my comments. First-off we were pleased to see that that growth which is really the first growth that we've had since the cyber incident in 2017. Those pipelines are building also, but I would still characterize the pipeline\u2019s there and then broadly in USIS is still building, meaning they're not at full maturity. We've made great progress as you know go back a year ago we were on hold with many of our customers and that really improved as it went through the year. So, the pipelines broadly as well as in the financial marketing side really started building in the fourth quarter and into the first quarter and I tried to give some color that that pipeline is continuing. And I also highlighted our new leader is -- brought what I would characterize as a new level of energy and focus and accountability with that team as well as commercial engagements. I'm spending a lot of time with customers as does Sid, our new leader. And all the discussions are around growth. Help us with new products. Help us with new ways to grow our business. We want to access Equifax assets. So we're seeing good momentum there and -- but we still expect USIS and financial services to be what I would characterize as choppy, until they get the full maturity around their pipelines, which \u2013 it's hard to predict when that's going to be. We just haven't seen it yet. George Mihalos : Okay, great. And just as a quick follow-up. If we look at mortgage, I think you talked about this sort of mix shift, if you will, to reseller. Is that secular? Would you expect that to continue over the long-term and is the right way to think about, sort of, a lower revenue per transaction, but sort of a de minimis impact on profitability? Thanks. John Gambler :  Yeah. So for your second question, that's correct, right? The revenue per transaction is lower, but the level of profit per transaction is relatively similar. Slightly higher in Mortgage Solutions obviously, but relatively similar. And in terms of whether it's a secular trend that's going to continue. No, I think it's really more market based, right? So it depends on competitive forces in the market. And you've seen our share of Mortgage Solutions go up and down within our portfolio over the years. That will probably continue to happen. Just, right now, we're in a situation where the competitive environment is such that we're better off having more of those sales go through the channel. Mark Begor :  And there was really one big customer that drove this one situation, which I think we talked about in the fourth quarter and maybe some in the first quarter too, that really drove that change in the revenue. And I don't view it as kind of a secular change. It was really one customer who made that change and we focused on margin. George Mihalos : Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question will come from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Dave Togut : Thank you. Good morning. Could you provide an update on demand trends from the other major drivers of U.S. consumer credit services like auto and credit card, for example? And then, just as a follow-up. If you could update us on your progress with trended data. How you're doing in your existing verticals? And then, are there some new verticals that you could enter with trended data in the future? Mark Begor : Yeah. In terms of the overall market performance, we haven't seen much of a change really. I think you've probably seen that from what the banks have announced, right? Over the last several quarters, we're continuing to see the same trends that we saw in the fourth quarter continuing into the first quarter in the card market. In the auto market, you're seeing \u2013 you might be \u2013 you're starting to see delinquencies pick up a little bit in sub-prime, but that really tends to be relatively localized, we believe, and you are actually seeing the overall credit quality we think of the entire auto portfolio actually improving. So \u2013 but generally speaking, the trends in the markets we serve, as you mentioned, other than mortgage we think are relatively consistent with what we saw late last year. Dave Togut : And then trended? Mark Begor : Sure. Trended data, I think, what \u2013 trended data is a key part of what we're trying to deploy and we continue to expand our product focus on trended data. I think, probably the most important thing, as Mark indicated, is as we move more and more to the data fabric, you'll see an increasing number of products that are focused on trended information. We still think we're the only party out there with trended commercial products, which will certainly extend now that we've acquired PayNet and it's something that we continue to expand in our portfolio. It isn't the driver behind our NPI, but it is an option \u2013 it is something that we're focused on in NPI. Dave Togut : Understood. Thank you very much. Mark Begor : Thanks. Operator : We will now hear from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Andrew Steinerman : Hi. This is Andrew. I wanted to ask about visibility in the USIS. I definitely heard you talked about the new leadership and the growing pipeline and the new level of energy. But could you give us a sense of how much revenue visibility you have now versus six months ago in USIS? And I mean that separate from any mortgage dynamic. Mark Begor : Yes. Maybe I'll start John then you can jump in. Yes, Andrew, you put a great mark around there. You go back six months ago, it's probably good mark to look back on. There's no question our revenue visibility has increased dramatically in how we can look through in USIS versus where we were last summer. That visibility has improved as we went through the fourth quarter and certainly into the first. We are still trying to be clear with you and our other investors and analysts that while that visibility is getting stronger, which one metric for that is our pipelines and how they're growing and how they've been rebuilding, it's still not back to where it was before the cyber incident USIS. That's really the business where that's still moving forward. So I would say a lot more visibly that we had six months ago. And part of that is it gives us the confidence in our comments around guidance for both second quarter and as well as the second half. I think as you know, we're showing the second half of this year improving on a year-over-year basis at a faster rate than the first half and we're doing that based on our confidence and our visibility. Would you add John? John Gambler : I think Mark covered it all, right? But the fact is I think we're starting to see more consistency in terms of delivery versus near-term forecast, right? And that gives us comfort that the visibility that we believe we have as we look forward is starting to improve. It's not what it was two years ago, but the accuracy of our forecast versus delivery is certainly getting better. Mark Begor : I think we mentioned Andrew that in the first quarter USIS was slightly above our expectations, which those are the kind of signs we're looking to see. Meaning that the teams says they're going to deliver something and they deliver it that gives us more confidence that they have the visibility and we have it also. Dave Togut : Right. I appreciate it. Mark Begor : Yes. Operator : Our next question will come from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Toni Kaplan : Thank you. Good morning. A question for you John. You mentioned the $200 million free cash flow guidance for the year and you have a cash balance right now of $133 million. And so just looking at the size of the after-tax accrual you're making I guess what's the timeline for paying the cash for the losses? And are you planning on raising debt? I'm assuming maybe not because the interest expense incorporated in the guidance didn't go up. So I just wanted to hear about that. And also does the settlement mean that you'll resume buybacks at this point or you're going to wait until the litigation is in the clear? Thank you. John Gambler : Yes. So in terms of the timing of any payments I think we need to complete the discussions as Mark mentioned. So when that's done, we'll have a lot more clarity on that. But the payments are likely some time in the future and our expectation is that we'll be borrowing to make any payments that we made. So that is our expectation. Mark Begor : And the second half of your question about buyback or dividend, we're not prepared to make -- have any discussions about what our plans are in that front yet. We need to finalize these discussions as John pointed out finalize the timing of the payments. We've been clear with you and other investors that we also want to see some clarity on the USIS recovery which is positive, but still not as predictable as we would like. And then the other leg on that chair about our capital allocation plan is around the EFX 2020 technology investment that we're in the middle of and we want to see a little more visibility on kind of schedule and delivery on that. So, a long winded answer around a question around stock buyback or dividend that's the discussion that we'll be having in the future with you. We're not ready to have that today. Toni Kaplan : Okay. Very helpful. And then just wanted to ask a bit about sentiments during the quarter. It sounds like you're happy with the growth and the new business starting to come back. Just wanted to also -- just sort of get a sense of a competitor of yours mentioned maybe some client caution after the fourth quarter market volatility. So, did you see that as well, and just wanted to hear about your sense on what's going on with the industry and the clients. Thank you. Mark Begor : Yeah. No, haven't seen those kind of dialogues around you characterized client caution. We have seen an increased dialogue with our customers around their work and we're partnering with them to do that about preparing for a potential economic slowdown. And what that really means, as you know, some of their focus around data assets changes to line management, credit line decreases, credit and collections a different focus on underwriting. So we've have got a number of customer dialogues going about wanting to work with us to be prepared for a potential economic slowdown. I don't think anyone is predicting it, but I would say that's a change for me in the last three, four, five months than it was kind of the middle of last year where that dialogue has been added to their kind of growth dialogue. Toni Kaplan : Perfect. Thanks, a lot, Mark. Operator : We will now hear from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Thanks. Hey, congrats on shifting that first Canadian customer to the cloud. Just any thoughts as to kind of the guidepost on that and what it can ultimately mean for the USIS business overall? And is there a way to maybe just frame that out within the context to the U.S. transformation? Mark Begor : Yeah. I assume you're referring, Kevin, to the like the benefits of speed to market and cost savings and all that stuff. If that's where you're heading we're working on that. We're going to be prepared to share that in the future with you and our investors. We're not ready to do that yet. But we try to be quite clear that we view this investment not only for USIS, but what we're doing around the globe as being transformational. We think it's going to differentiate us from our competitors. It's something that will be hard for our competitors to do at the same pace were doing. And we're seeing -- there is clear cost benefits of cloud versus legacy. There's clear stability reliability benefits. Meaning our focus is to move to always on versus 3 9s, 5 9s, 5 9s of stability. In today's world that's critically important. And then the speed to market, the ability to get products to market or in just data assets in weeks versus months is going to be another will benefit. So we continue to be energized about what it's going to deliver, and we know we've got a plan and the requirement to really share with you guys some clarity around those benefits. And I think that'll certainly come to the table when we're ready to put our long-term framework back in place. I think that's the time that we'll share some real visibility about not only our view of Equifax for the future, but the view of Equifax, including our investment in technology and security through EFX2020. John Gamble : And I think we said previously that in both cost of sales and then also our development expense that we would expect to see the type of savings that you've seen from other companies that have moved from the cloud. So, we've seen savings that are double-digits in percentages and we would expect to be able to deliver those types of savings. Kevin McVeigh : Super, helpful. And then just any initial thoughts on the reception to the FICO partnership from a client perspective? Mark Begor : Yes. It's a great question. It's quite positive. We made the announcement back in March and we were working with FICO for about six months on this and start talking to customers really in the fourth quarter about it. And between us and FICO, we got a pipeline of I don't know a couple of dozen customers that are really energized about it. But the feedback is quite positive from customers about this is an option. Customer still want to buy from FICO directly. They want to buy from Equifax directly. But there's a set of customers that are really energized about the benefits that come from an integrated solution of FICO's software assets and Equifax' Ignite + InterConnect and differentiated data assets. So we're energized about it as we roll through the second quarter and into the second half. Kevin McVeigh : Super. Congrats. Mark Begor : Thanks. Operator : Our next question will come from Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. Ashish Sabadra : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick follow-up on an earlier comment about trends in regards to FMS. So FMS is essentially batch downloads both for marketing as well as decisioning. Have you seen a better demand on one versus another or any particular verticals where you have seen trend? Thanks. John Gamble : So our Financial Marketing Services business is principally CMS. If I don't cover your question, sorry, but it's principally CMS. And we saw nice growth in CMS this quarter. CMS is really consistent with the normal type of products that you'd see go into credit marketing services of a financial institution. So we don't sell anything particularly different than that. We have seen an expansion into a new customer base. We started to start selling into consulting firms and some other firms that also can utilize our data for appropriate reasons. So we're starting to see an expansion of the customer base. But other than that no trends that are different than normal. Ashish Sabadra : That's good. That's good. And then maybe just quickly on GCS. I understand the results, they have changed slightly below expectations. But as you look forward, are there anything on the strategic front that you're planning to do in order to improve the growth there? John Gamble : Yes. There's really two efforts there. One is on our partner business. As you know, we've got relationships with Credit Karma Life Lock and others like that. So continued growth there and that's performing well that side of the business. On the core D2C business, direct-to-consumer, we're both accelerating our advertising. So that's going to help grow our subscriber growth there. But the real game changer for us is the big investment we're making in our technology, our Renaissance platform that's going to allow us to do things like cross-selling and other things with the business that we think will help later in the year and particularly in 2020. So that's some of the things that the team is working on in GCS. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks. That's helpful. Operator : And we will now hear from Tim McHugh with William Blair. Tim McHugh : Yes. Just wanted to follow-up on some of the technology comments you made in the prepared remarks. One I think there's a comment that the move to the data fabric is slightly later than you thought. I guess, is that I guess elaborate on why that is? And then secondly, you talked about the target of trying to migrate half of the customers onto InterConnect the cloud version by the end of the year. How does -- as you plan for that I guess how disruptive is that to the clients? What's the approach you're using as you migrate people? And kind of what's the profile of people migrating this year versus next year? Thanks. Mark Begor : Yes. So maybe on the first one. Obviously this is a big project that we're doing and we're going to have slight delay. This was delayed by -- weeks or whatever. And that's going to happen and we just want to be transparent with you that we're working on it. And when we have something that's a little bit behind we'll share it with you. And when we're ahead we'll do the same thing. So we don't do that as a big issue. But it's just a level of transparency that we want to have because of the scale of the investment. With regards to the customer piece our goal and what we work on is to make this as easy as possible. But as you know these are never easy. Each customer has their own technology department. And we've done this before and we do it all the time and it's one that you just have to be open and transparent with the customer. You got to be visible with them. We got to work around their schedule make sure it works on where they want to do it. But our goal is to make it as frictionless as possible for them. But there's always work that they have to do when you make these transformations. John Gamble : The team has done a nice job of putting the customers in categories. We have some customers where the impact on them will be relatively minor because they use gateways more than anything else. So that's a relatively small lift for them and quite straightforward. Other customers that use our decisioning very heavily we actually manage the decisioning system for them. So in that case we can do most of the work. And for them it's mostly testing which isn't a nothing lift. But it's -- but we can try to take a lot of the heavylifting ourselves. And then with the kind of the rest of the customers which is a large group of customers, the team has done a really great job of building out standard solution architecture sets that they can help the customers deploy more rapidly and that should actually give them more functionality than they have today. So it's not just the migration per saying, it's the migration that gets them more and gets them on to a standard product set that will allow them to actually extend the usage of the product and we're going to build on that as we go forward and that's a promise we're making to the customer. So I think they have a very good plan that's structured well and that they're progressing on. Tim McHugh : Those customers that you're starting, or you mentioned, should I think of those as the simpler ones that you want to start with? Or are they bigger or smaller customers? Anything about the kind of the initial cohort? John Gamble : Actually it's done as Mark said based on when the customer's ready to engage. So a lot of the smaller ones occurred that's certainly true because that's more within our control, but there's also substantial customers where we're also working on migration already. So it's really depending on when the customer is ready to receive the work. Tim McHugh : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Andrew Jeffrey : Hi. Good morning. Appreciate taking the question. I wondered if I could just drill down a little bit on the commentary in USIS about visibility. Mark, you mentioned, I think you referenced delivery timing from sort of customer engagement to delivery. What about close rates? I mean when you start your sales cycle I guess to close rate from engagement to actually getting the customer to commit I mean has that changed at all? And mean how much of the improvement that you're anticipating as a function of customer behavior versus Equifax\u2019 ability in timing and delivery? Mark Begor : John, you want? John Gambler : Sure. So I think what I -- Mark kind of mentioned timing which is certainly important right? And that's really what's going on now. As we continue to build in the funnel and there's more opportunities available, our comfort with our ability to close within the funnel which is now larger is improving, right? So to us timing of closure and rate of closure are very similar, because they're just separated in time, right? And we continue to focus and Sid and team has done a great job of focusing on just building the funnel, so that if the timing is variable which it has been and continues to be and is more variable than it used to be. That's all still true. But as we continue to build the funnel to have more opportunities, we're getting more comfortable that we're able to deliver our forecasts, because we have greater opportunities to deliver. So, I really -- I don't think it's really in any more complicated than that. And as the funnels continue to feel better, we get more comfortable with delivery. And quite honestly, as months pass and we deliver on the numbers that we commit to ourselves, we get more comfortable as well. And that's really what's going on. And you're still choppy. Mark Begor : And you go back to fourth quarter, like USIS was kind of where we thought they are where we should be and where they committed to be. And we saw that again in the first quarter. They were actually a little bit ahead of our expectations. So that kind of a track record gives us confidence that all the things you're talking about are happening. Close rates are getting more predictable and pipelines are building. But it's -- we still remain cautious. It's only a couple of quarters in here of that kind of a track record. John Gamble : And the choppiness is still there. We don't want to -- have you think that it's not. It's still there. And certainly there could be period where things that don't occur the way we expect, because the pipeline isn't as big as normal. We could still end up with an unexpected outcome. So it's better, but it's not different than what we said a quarter ago. Andrew Jeffrey : Okay. I appreciate that. And then, with regard to sort of your broad FinTech facing solutions and position in the market. Could you just sort of characterize where you think you are competitively and whether there's -- whether you'd anticipate a ramp sort of generally speaking in FinTech end market? Mark Begor : I think we've talked in -- yeah, I think we've talked in the past that this is a space that you go back as recently as a year ago or late 2017, we weren't as focused on FinTech as we should have been. I think that's an understatement. I think it's clear our competitors are much stronger. We have a great market position with the FinTechs with Workforce Solutions. A lot of the FinTechs are using The Work Number. So that's a strong market position. But if you look at our overall share in FinTech, it's quite small. And we talked last year -- I think mid-last year we doubled our commercial team in FinTech. We've got real pipelines now of dialogues with FinTechs. I've met with a bunch of them personally. And the dialogues with them are really quite positive about the fact that we had differentiated data. Work Number is one. Our credit file is another one. NCTUE, the utilities cellphone database. So the dialogues are quite positive. And we would expect to see FinTech grow from a fairly small level where it is today as we go through the rest of this year and into next year. We are really focused on getting into FinTech and being a bigger player there. Andrew Jeffrey : Right. Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : We'll now hear from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America. Gary Bisbee : Hi, guys. Good morning. I guess, the first question. Just how should we think about the risk of customers pushing out signing your business until after the tech transformation is complete? And are you hearing that feedback, hey, it sounds good. But like let's wait and see you get your house in order before we sign on rather than coming on board amid the migrations and everything? Mark Begor : Yeah. Zero. Don't hear anything on that. The term house in order, we look at it our house is in order. Meaning, our technology is sound. It works and I don't have to remind you. You go back to last year, before the cybersecurity breach, our technology was working fine. It still does today. We're taking advantage of our big investment in security to really transform our technology. And the dialogues of customers is really -- they're quite positive. They look at it, well this is the partner I want to be with, if they're going to make this kind of investment in their technology. And you couple that with our differentiated data assets, the discussions are very positive. So we don't have any customers saying well we're going to hold off. They are really quite energized. When I sit with them and talk about the commitment we have to them through this technology investment, the dialogue is we want to be partners with you guys. So that's kind of how -- what I'm hearing in the marketplace. John Gambler : We have customers who want to work with us to help us do this faster, so we can help them, right? Mark Begor : Totally. John Gambler : It's a very positive thing. Mark Begor : Well the other thing is most of our customers, we have a few that are quite advanced on the cloud but very few. And those customers see what we're doing, the amount of investment we're making. And our technology teams are increasingly engaging with their technology teams about their own cloud transformation. And they want to learn from us. They want to follow what we're doing. So that's another element of the dialogue. And the same thing happens to security. We\u2019re obviously have a commitment to be an industry leader in security. We made massive investments in the last 18 months in security and that's another dialogue with the technology teams about what are you guys doing around security so we can learn from that. Andrew Jeffrey : Great. Thanks. And then just the second, the follow-up. You talked a lot about the savings you expect to get from the transformation over the next several years. I guess at this point, do you have a view on how much you'd likely let fall to the bottom line versus is there maybe a view that stepping up innovation spending or some other to drive the top line would be a way to reinvest meaningful portion of the savings? Mark Begor : Yes. It's hard for me Gary to talk about the technology savings. I think we'll get to that when we put our long-term framework back in place. But I think you see us making decisions now and we have in the last six, 12 months around investment decisions. We did our fairly significant restructuring in the fourth quarter and took some of those cost savings to the bottom line. But we also plowed savings back into more commercial resources. We plowed savings back into more DNA resources. We're obviously investing a ton in technology. We're very visible on that in security. And then NPI and new products has been and continues to be a priority for us where we're continuing to make significant investments. And we give you visibility on the new products we're rolling out to the marketplace. And some of that new product work is coming through our technology transformation. So we're investing in the future today. And what we do with the benefits from our technology and security investments I think we'll talk about that when we get to our long-term financial framework. Andrew Jeffrey : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Mark Begor : Hi, Bill. Bill Warmington : Good morning, everyone. So first congratulations to Mark on hitting the one-year mark and on settlement. So first question for you is on the price increase that FICO put through this year starting January 1. They -- that's going to phase in throughout 2019. Equifax is a big player in auto. And I was hoping you could help us understand how that could potentially help USIS in the second half. Mark Begor : John, you want? John Gambler : Yes. So, obviously, the FICO price increase impacts us. It impacts our customers. We pass it through to our customers and it will impact both revenue and margin. It's kind of a very similar story to what we had last year with the price increase related to mortgage. So, it's really no different than that. In terms of magnitude, we don't give specific numbers in terms of the magnitude of dollars of that occur with the partner. But it'll be very similar in concept to what happened with mortgage, just much smaller. Bill Warmington : Got it. And then you mentioned in your prepared remarks that there was potential for you to work with FICO in some new ways in the near future. I was hoping you could expand on that. Mark Begor : Yes, I don't think we're ready, Bill, to talk about those. We've got -- because of those partnership kind of structural umbrella that we created. We're in kind of constant dialogues with Will Lansing and his team in different ways that we might work together. We're seeing some new things that were kind of percolating on that could be beneficial for us and FICO. I'm a big believer in leveraging our strengths with another companies through partnerships. And this is an example of where we're trying to exercise that muscle and find ways to do things that are going to benefit us FICO and our joint or new customers. So, stay tuned, I guess, is the right answer. Bill Warmington : All right. Well, thank you very much. Operator : Our next question will come from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. George Tong : Hi thanks. Good morning. You've indicated that you're still cautious around the pace of recovery of USIS, but are confident that the business will get back to traditional growth levels over the long-term. Can you discuss any structural factors that may be holding you back from formally reinstating your long-term growth targets? Mark Begor : You got two different questions in there. I think George, on the long-term growth targets, we've been very clear with you and others that we certainly intend to put long-term growth framework to move back in place. We've been clear that there were a number of things we wanted to see some clarity on. One was our legal and regulatory settlement which we made progress there but that's not complete yet. Second was on our technology transformation. And again we're making progress on that and we want some more visibility there. And third was on USIS which may be a part of your question, we want to see some stability in the recovery. And we're kind of a couple of quarters into say due meaning they're delivering where we thought they were going to deliver. And we want to see some continued performance as well as sequential growth there. And those are kind of the three things that John and I in the leadership team think about before we're going to put a long-term framework in place. And we continue to be confident that not only USIS, but Equifax will recover to where it was pre-breach and that confidence comes from our discussions with customers, our growing pipeline, our differentiated data assets, all those we think are going to allow us to return. I don't see anything structural. It's just a matter of time. And we're seeing some positive progress in the first quarter. We expect that to continue in the second quarter and as well through the rest of the year. George Tong : Got it, that's helpful. And turning to the pipeline, specifically in USIS, it sounds like the pipeline is still building and not yet back to full maturity. Can you talk about how quickly the pipeline is growing and what changes to the salesforce you may have made to drive better and faster close rates? Mark Begor : Well, on the salesforce, we continue to energize our sales team or incenting them and there are some new talent coming in. Obviously, we have a new leader in the business now, which I'm quite energized about the last 60 days, under Sid's leadership. In regards to the pipeline building, I don't have any metrics, John? John Gambler : We don't disclose pipeline metrics, so. Mark Begor : But we try to give visibility and just maybe more anecdotally here that John and I are seeing those pipelines build and the evidence for you is USIS delivering what they -- what we commit that they're going to do, and we've done that for couple of quarters and we want that to continue. George Tong : Got it. Thank you. Operator : We'll now hear from Brett Huff with Stephens. Brett Huff : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Two questions for me. One, can you talk a little bit about PayNet? I want to make sure I understand that it's 150 basis points in 2Q on USIS help or total company help? I guess that's just a housekeeping question. Mark Begor : USIS. Brett Huff : Okay. And then was that originally in the guide? I don't think it was. So is there something else in the guide, is it Australia that's a little bit more muted? Is there an offset to that inorganic help that we didn't raise our overall guidance for? Or is it just kind of conservatism? John Gambler : Yeah. So for the full -- you wanted the full year? Brett Huff : Yes. John Gambler : So the full year, PayNet was a plus, exclusive with the mortgage market would be better, would be less bad than we had indicated initially. And then with the weakness is GCS is a bit weaker than we said and initially back in February than we thought. And FX was quite a bit more negative than we thought, right? We said 0.5 point of growth were being impacted by FX, and probably the smallest of the three is -- Australia is a bit weaker but that isn't the driver. Brett Huff : Okay. And that's super helpful. And then on the migrations that are happening congrats on the remarkable pace you guys are going to take up on that with half, I think the USIS being done in 2019. Once that starts and -- have we done a couple of trials? Or are we right in the middle of that? Or kind of what -- do we have early results on smaller clients be moved over or how do you kind of feel about that? John Gambler : So we currently have moved -- we're not going to give numbers as we go. But we're well into the migration. It's still early days. So -- but the team has moved to substantial number of clients on to cloud fabrics. So that's -- we think that's going well. And the migrations are going on to InterConnect SaaS. And initially things move on to the -- to our private cloud and then they'll move on to the public private cloud as things move forward. But that migration is going well and that last step is simple. So we feel very good about how things are progressing and that the team is working really well. Brett Huff : Great. Appreciate the insights. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. Trevor Burns : No further comments. Just thanks everybody for participating in the call and appreciate your time. Thank you. Operator : Again that does conclude our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Trevor Burns. Please go ahead, sir. Trevor Burns : Thanks and good morning, welcome to today's conference call. I'm Trevor Burns, Investor Relations. With me today are Mark Begor, CEO, and John Gamble, CFO. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com. During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements including 3Q and full-year 2019 guidance, to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risk, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2018 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. Also, we'll be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. For the second quarter of 2019, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes accrual for legal matters related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident, cost associated with the acquisition-related amortization expense, the income tax effects of stock awards, recognized upon vesting or settlement, certain acquisition cost, and foreign currency losses from remeasuring the Argentinian peso denominated net monetary assets. Adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax also excludes legal and professional fees related to the cybersecurity incident principally fees related to our outstanding litigation and government investigations. As well as the incremental non-recurring project costs designed to enhance our technology and data security. This includes projects to implement systems and processes to enhance our technology, and data security infrastructure. As well as projects to replace and substantially consolidate our global networks and systems as well as the cost to manage these projects. These projects that will transform our technology infrastructure and further enhance our data security, were incurred throughout 2018 and are expected to occur in 2019 and 2020. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to Equifax adding back interest expense, net of interest income, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization and also is the case for adjusted EPS, excluding accruals for legal matters related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident. Costs related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident, certain acquisition costs and foreign currency losses from remeasuring the Argentinian peso denominated net monetary assets. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our website. Now I'd like to turn it over to, Mark. Mark Begor : Thanks, Trevor, and good morning everyone. As you know, this was a busy week in quarter for Equifax with Monday's settlement announcement, and our focus during the quarter on driving growth, operations in the EFX 2020 technology and security transformation. Before I get into a discussion of our second quarter financial results in the business units, let me spend a few minutes discussing the announcement we made on Monday, about the legal settlements we made in connection with the 2017 cybersecurity incident. Monday's announcement was a real milestone and pivot for Equifax, which allows us to fully focus on operations, driving growth in our EFX 2020 technology and data security transformation. The comprehensive resolution we announced is comprised of multiple related settlement agreements with the consumer class action plaintiffs and the federal Multi District proceedings, the attorney generals of 48 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia, the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the New York State Department of Financial Services and resolve the claims and investigations brought by these parties related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident. As you recall from our first quarter earnings call in May, we recorded an accrual of $690 million for expected losses associated with certain legal proceedings and government investigations related to the 2017 incident. Principally as a result of the comprehensive settlement announced on Monday, we increased the accrual by approximately $11 million in the second quarter of 2019, resulting in total charges of $701 million. This amount excludes the cost we have incurred to date offering free credit monitoring to US consumers in 2017, 2018 and 2019 for which we've already taken charges. Details of the settlement and related costs are available in the 8-K we filed on Monday. Importantly, the settlement program establishes a single consumer restitution fund that will be available to pay consumer benefits and legal fees and expenses and it is addition to the protections provided by Equifax immediately following the 2017 cybersecurity incident, including free credit monitoring in our Lock and Alert service. A single consumer fund was a real priority for Equifax and is a win for consumers. The consumer restitution fund will be available to pay for 4 years of additional 3-Bureau credit monitoring for consumers, who's information was impacted by the 2017 breach, actual out of pocket losses related to the breach and other consumer benefits such as identity restoration services. Equifax will also be providing free single Equifax bureau -- free single-bureau Equifax credit reports were up to an additional 6 years. There are 2 circumstances in which Equifax could incur cost in excess of the $300 million consumer restitution fund. First, to the extent that more consumers enroll in credit monitoring than contemplated in the consumer fund, Equifax would have to fund this cost. The fund is structured to cover credit monitoring enrollees of up to 7 million. Second, to the extent, consumer out of pocket loss has exceed the amounts available in the fund, Equifax would have to fund the amount of these incremental losses up $125 million. And as a reminder, we have not identified any instances of data being used for identity theft purposes or the data that was stolen being sold on the Dark Web. Our expected total $701 million accrual does not include any provision for Equifax incurring incremental cost for either of these two items, because we believe that $300 million in the consumer restitution fund will cover the expected costs. The settlement represent resolution of many of the significant legal and regulatory issues facing the Company related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident, including the consumer class action and investigations by state Attorney General, New York state DFS and our principal US regulators CFPB and FTC. There do remain other additional unresolved claims and litigation related to the 27 incident, a listing of these claims, can be found in our 10-Q which we'll file later today. We intend to work with all the parties to bring these remaining matters to closure as soon as possible while balancing the needs of our company, employees, customers and shareholders. As you know, we prepared ourselves financially for this settlement by strengthening our balance sheet, including suspending our stock buyback program and freezing our dividend in 2017. Our current plans are to finance the settlement payments with existing borrowing capacity under our revolving credit and securitization facilities. As of the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $1.1 billion of borrowing capacity available to us. John will provide more details on the expected timing of the payments and impact on our second half guidance in a few minutes. This is a very positive step forward for Equifax and for our shareholders. The settlement will not have an impact on our one point 1.25 billion technology and security program, our internal investment plans, new product introductions, payment of our quarterly dividend at the current rate or our plans to grow and expand Equifax with acquisition. This resolution allows us to fully focus on the future. Let me move now to our results for the second quarter. We were very pleased with our second quarter financial results as revenue was at the top end of our guidance and adjusted EPS was above the range as we provided in May. These financial results are another positive step forward for Equifax. Revenue of $880 million was up 3% in constant dollar currency and up just over 1% on an organic constant currency basis and the strongest results since the cyber security incident in 2017. During the quarter, US mortgage market inquiries were up about 2% compared to the prior year, better than our projection of down 1% resulting about 5 million of additional revenue in the quarter versus our May guidance. However, FX further weakened during the quarter relative to our May guidance impacting revenue negatively by about $2 million. Overall, the strength in the quarter was driven by our US B2B businesses, USIS, and Workforce Solutions. In the quarter, both USIS and EWS performed better than we expected. Both businesses performed extremely well online with USIS online up 10% in total and 6% organically. And worked -- Workforce Solutions verifier revenue was up a very strong 15% both businesses grew their non-mortgage online business stronger than we expected. In addition to benefiting from the stronger US mortgage market. In total, our US online business, which includes USIS online, EWS verifier in the GCS partner business represents half of our total revenue and are expected to grow about 10%. International was weaker than we expected in the quarter, particularly in the UK, I'll provide some more details on that in a minute. Adjusted EPS of a $1.40 a share was above the top end of the guidance we provided in May, given lower than expected corporate expenses and slightly better than expected business unit margins from the stronger revenue growth. In the second quarter, total non-recurring or one-time costs related to the cybersecurity incident and our transformation exclusive of any accruals for legal matters related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident, which I discussed a few minutes ago were $82 million and consistent with our expectations. This includes $70 million of technology and security spend and $12 million for legal and investigative fees. We expect 2019 one-time costs related to the cybersecurity incident in our EFX 2020 technology and data security cloud transformation, exclusive of any legal accruals to be just over $350 million. To the extent, we are able to provide to further accelerate data exchange or Cambrian Ignite deployments into our cloud data fabric at Google or customer transitions to our interconnect API decisioning engines at AWS or Google spending could exceed these levels. Shifting now to USIS. USIS revenue was up 2.5% on a reported basis, and down slightly on an organic basis compared to last year, but better than we expected. With USIS revenue, organic revenue up 1% excluding over 1 percentage point negative impact from the mix shift our mortgage business in the mortgage market. Importantly, we saw solid double -- We saw solid single-digit organic revenue growth in our USIS segment for the first time since the cyber incident. This is a very positive sign for USIS. Sid Singh and is USIS team are back in growth mode and are showing some positive commercial traction in activity. USIS online revenue was up almost 10% on a reported basis and up almost 6% on an organic basis reflecting solid growth in our government and insurance verticals and double-digit growth in identity and fraud solutions aided by new product sales. This is a very positive sign of USIS recovery in the marketplace. Online organic revenue growth, excluding the favorable impact of mortgage market and mix shift, was still up over 3% compared to last year. This was the first quarter of positive online organic revenue growth since prior to the breach. A very positive sign as we return USIS to a growth mode. Mortgage Solutions was down 22% in the quarter due to the mix shift, we have discussed previously with mortgage resellers, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2018. Mix shift had a negative 2% impact on USIS revenue growth in the second quarter while the USIS operating profit was not materially impacted. We expect the revenue headwind from this mortgage mix shift to continue for the remainder of 2019. Financial marketing services was down 7% compared to last year and was weaker than we expected. As we indicated consistently in our May discussion, our financial marketing services revenue is choppy, as the timing of closing deals is still not as predictable as it was prior to the cybersecurity incident. In the first quarter, FMS revenue was up 6% as we closed some large transactions. For the six months of 2019 FMS revenue will be down about 1%, this 6 month view has been relatively consistent for the past several quarters at about flat and much better than we saw in the 6 months through the third quarter of 2018, where revenue was down about 6%. Looking forward to the second half of 2019, we expect growth in FMS as our strength in sales efforts drive growth off the relatively stable and flat base we have seen over the past nine months. In terms of customers, the USIS team is back on their front feet with growing new deal and new product pipelines, as we saw with a strong online growth this quarter. USIS new deal pipelines are up 2X from January 2018 and up over 30% from December 2019, which is a very positive sign for the second half in 2020. We continue to believe that our differentiated data assets coupled with our technology investments will return USIS to its traditional growth mode, but we do remain cautious on the pace of the recovery. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins of 45.6% were down about 200 basis points from second quarter '18 primarily driven by increased royalty costs as well as the continued investments in security and data analytics to drive new product sales. USIS continues to very effectively manage SG&A costs while at the same time increasing the percentage of resources can dedicated to sales DNA and NPI and product development to drive growth. Shifting now to Workforce Solutions, they had another very strong quarter with revenue up almost a 11% compared to last year and better than our expectations. Verification services delivered extremely strong results with revenue up 15% driven by strong double-digit growth across healthcare, talent solutions, mortgage and government. The strong verification services revenue growth reflects the continued growth in Work Number, active records as well as the new products and further penetration into key markets. EWS has a deep and growing pipeline of new, twin contributors that they expect to add to their growing database in the second half of 2019. As you know twin records are monetized virtually immediately as they are added to our database and increased hit rates on our twin file. Employer services declined in the quarter less than 1% consistent with our expectations, driven principally by workforce analytics, our ACA business as well as our unemployment claims business. This was as expected with the strong employment market in the US. Offsetting the decline in workforce analytics, we saw a slight growth in our I-9 and onboarding business. As we indicated last quarter, we expect employer services revenue to be down low single digit percentage for the full year. The strong verifier growth resulted in very strong adjusted EBITDA margins of 49.3%, an expansion in the quarter of 170 basis points. We expect EWS EBITDA margins to continue to be very strong in the second half. EWS continues to perform very well and it's a franchise business for Equifax. Shifting now to international, where revenue was flat in local currency, and down 8.5% on a reported basis and below our expectations. Canada continued to perform well, consistent with our expectations. Australia declined in the quarter as we expected and we are seeing signs of stabilization in that market. However, the UK performance was much weaker than we expected, and although Latin America showed improved growth, the improvement was less than expected. Asia Pacific, which is predominantly Australia declined and expected 5% in local currency in the quarter, principally related to the weakening we began to see in the third quarter of '18 in Australia, consumer lending, particularly mortgage and other consumer and commercial credit markets in Australia. We are beginning to see stabilization in the Australian market following their election, a few months ago, but we expect market growth to remain weak through the bulk of 2019, although the revenue growth impacts will begin to lessen in the second half as we approach the period of their initial decline in the third quarter of 2018. As I mentioned, we are seeing some positive signs in the Australian marketplace including lower interest rates and regulatory actions that have been taken that we believe may stimulate consumer and commercial credit demand in the second half. We are also making very good progress on positive data in Australia, and by the end of this year we expect to have in excess of 80% of positive data from contributors. Shifting now to Europe, our European business declined 3% in local currency in the quarter, a much weaker performance than we expected. The UK debt management business drove the largest portion of the decline, principally due to the deferral of debt placements by the UK government, which were not received until late June. As these debt placements we received late in the quarter, they did not generate the expected revenue from collection activity in the second quarter, but will deliver revenue in the second half. Our European credit business was down 1% much weaker in the mid-to-high single-digit revenue growth we have seen over the last year. Online, which represents about half of credit revenue, grew about 5%, which although reasonable growth was down from stronger growth we've seen over the past year, project revenue also declined in the quarter due to timing of some deals that shifted into the third quarter as well as some customer delays, we're starting to see as a result of the Brexit uncertainty. Absent substantial weakening in the UK economy in the second half and as the Brexit approaches and hopefully gets resolved we're expecting to see a recovery in the growth of our European business, and UK business. Debt management is expected to see growth due to the debt placements from the UK government received in late June and expected growth over the remainder of 2019. And our credit business is expected to recover in the second half of 2019 due to solid deal pipelines and a much stronger leadership focus on improved execution. Shifting now to Latin America, our business grew about 7.5% in local currency in the quarter. This has improved from first quarter growth of 5% but weaker than expected, principally in Chile. While we saw high single-digit growth in Chile this quarter, a couple of deals in NPI launches were delayed into the third quarter. We did see double-digit constant currency growth in Argentina and Ecuador and high single-digit constant currency growth in Paraguay in Chile, which was positive. We expect growth to accelerate in the second half as our Latin America businesses benefit from the expansion of Ignite and InterConnect SaaS rollouts and strong NPI rollouts in both 2017, 2018 and the first half of 2019, shifting now to Canada, which grew almost 9% in local currency in the quarter, reflecting a continued focus on customer innovation and new products and we expect this growth to continue through the rest of the year. We recently announced that our Canadian leader Lisa Nelson will be transitioning to takeover our Australia business in about a week. Lisa has done an outstanding job bringing our Canadian business to market leadership through an intense focus on the customer. We're excited to bring this customer focused leadership to Australia. International adjusted EBITDA margins at 28.6%, were down about 190 basis points in the quarter, principally reflecting lower revenue and margins on Australia and the UK and slower growth in Latin America, partially offset by margin expansion in Canada. Importantly, EBITDA margins were up sequentially 330 basis points, reflecting strong revenue growth in Canada and improved sequential margin in Australia from the fourth quarter and first quarter cost actions. We expect revenue growth in international to improve significantly in the second half, driven by continued good revenue growth in Canada accelerated growth in Latin America and a return to revenue growth in the UK and Australia. We believe this improved revenue growth along with the full benefit of the cost reductions taken in the fourth quarter of last year and first half of this year will significantly improve margins in the second half of 2019. We're watching our international business closely, particularly the Australian economy and the UK Brexit impact. Shifting now to Global Consumer Solutions revenue declined 6.5% on a reported basis and 6% on a local currency basis in the second quarter, which was slightly better than our expectations. Our global consumer direct business was down about 6.5% and it was just under half of our total GCS revenue. Our US consumer direct business saw revenue declines of 8% versus 2018, in the quarter as a result of the suspension of US consumer advertising in the fourth quarter of 2017, after the cybersecurity incident. As you know GCS began limited direct marketing to US consumers in late 2018. And we are starting to see subscriber growth from our restarted marketing and importantly US consumer direct revenue was up 3% sequentially. We expect to see US subscriber growth increase as we continue advertising in the year unfolds. In our Canadian and UK direct businesses, both also saw sequential revenue growth. Our GCS partner business which is about half of total GCS revenue declined 4.5% in the quarter through the timing of some project related revenue with customers that occurred in the first quarter. We expect partner revenue to return to growth in the third quarter. We expect GCS revenue to be up slightly in the second half as we lap the periods where consumer direct revenue began to stabilize in 2018. Adjusted GCS EBITDA margins declined as expected in the quarter as we saw the effective revenue loss and an increase in advertising. We expect margins to increase in the second half as we see the benefit from stable and growing revenue as well as cost actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2018 and first quarter. Our GCS business is making solid progress recovering from a challenging 2018. Now for an update on our EFX 2020 technology transformation plans. As you remember, there are 5 significant pillars to the cloud transformation and I'll give you a brief update on each of them. First , we're moving our credit and other data exchanges to a standard data fabric at GCP. In the second quarter, we saw a significant milestone, as our data fabric pattern based on GCP native tooling and including our full security stack was completed in the new GCP cloud format and made available to our business units to begin migrating their data exchanges to this new cloud environment. Our USIS and EWS teams as well as our Canadian and corporate teams are actively working on migrating critical data exchanges to our new GCP cloud-based data fabric. Although data fabric was made slightly -- was made available slightly behind schedule, we remain on track to migrate several of our US and EWS exchanges including replicas of the US consumer credit exchange or ACRO, the Work Number exchange, NCTUE exchange, I-9 and unemployment claims databases to the common data fabric in the 3rd and 4th quarters of this year. Also, beginning in July, any new datasets will be able to be directly ingested into our new cloud-based data fabric. We are at a place where our migration are now beginning to be tied to new customer workloads, so we will continue to update our delivery to align to near-term customer projects. As we discussed, moving from siloed databases, in the US, for example, we have close to 50 siloed databases, to a single data fabric in the cloud will enhance the speed and ease of accessing our differentiated data assets for our customers. It will also allow us to add more differentiated alternative data assets to enhance decisioning for our customers. Second, we made very good progress and continuing the integration of our Ignite analytics environment and InterConnect interfaces and decisioning production platforms at EWS and soon in the Google Cloud. We've completed initial implementation of attribute services in Ignite with open source production languages, so that clients and customers can develop attributes in open source language and seamlessly deploy into Equifax platforms. We are well on our way to having both online and offline seamless integration completed in the fourth quarter. The integration of Ignite and InterConnect will give Equifax a market advantage around speed and ease of moving from modeling, directly to production. Third, we are continuing to migrate customers from legacy decisioning and interface systems onto our cloud native Ignite, InterConnect SaaS product suite. Progress on this effort is now accelerating. For example, USIS continues to deploy the new cloud native products on to which they will migrate existing customers. Although we were slightly behind schedule on completing these standard patterns and migrating customers, we still expect to complete the migration of a significant majority of our customers by the end of this year and continuing into 2020. Fourth is our network migration. In the second quarter, we achieved another significant milestone enabling for dual redundant high speed cloud integrations in the US, they will allow us to move traffic securely and directly between our cloud vendors and from our cloud vendors to Equifax to substantially improve network performance and strengthen security. This is a critical step in taking full advantage of the virtual private cloud strategy enables us to begin to eliminate our legacy technical debt. We will expand the use of this capability in the US over the rest of the year and into 2020 as well as deploying this capability in Canada , Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific in the second half. And last, our global consumer systems and customer and consumer support system migrations continue to progress as planned. While many of the support applications that our customer facing, they are expected to significantly enhance the efficiency of our sales organization as well as the operational effectiveness of our client delivery and call center teams. In the fourth quarter, we launched myEquifax consumer portal and we are quickly adding consumer accounts to this new database. The new capabilities will enhance our customer service and allow for low cost cross sell of Equifax or partner products to consumers. Last quarter, we started to discuss some of the benefits we expect from the EFX 2020 technology transformation to the cloud. We continue to find our view of the top end line benefits and John will update you on our current thinking. But we continue to be energized about the benefits that will be delivered by the cloud transformation to both our top and bottom lines. I hope this gives you a sense of the positive progress, we are making in our technology transformation that will deliver new cloud-based technology to our customers. We remain committed to strong progress against our milestones in the second half. I also want to give you a quick update on our progress with FICO, on the commercial and technology partnership we announced in March called Data Decisions Cloud. Our teams are working extremely well together and making great progress both on the technical integration of our capabilities and the commercial discussions with our joint customers. The first 3 joint product launches include number one, connected platform which integrates FICO's Decision Management Solution with Equifax Ignite -- Equifax's Ignite decisioning sandbox, interconnect and Equifax data in a cloud environment. We believe this combined solution will deliver functionality that is not available in the marketplace today. Second, AML connect will integrate Equifax's differentiated data with FICO's AML and KYC platform to offer a full service end-to-end compliance offering that we believe will offer best-in-class search match capabilities and insights to the marketplace. And number 3 pre-screen central integrates FICO's marketing solutions suite with Equifax is differentiated consumer data to deliver a current turnkey direct marketing solution through our joint customers. We're making great progress on these 3 new product collaborations and expect to identify additional ways to leverage our joint capabilities in our FICO partnership for new product offerings in the future. Shifting the new product innovation, this remains a key component of our strategy and a long term muscle for Equifax. We have an active pipeline of over 80 NPIs and new products at various stages in the funnel. And we expect to launch about 60 new products in 2019 , which is a similar pace from the past 3 years. While new product introductions primarily came from international markets last year, about 40% of the new products introduced this year are from our US businesses. This is a good sign as we collaborate with customers to bring new products to market. On the M&A front, in May, we announced the acquisition of PayNet a leader in unique commercial lending data and insights. Customer feedback on the PayNet assets is very strong and integration activities with USIS are proceeding very well. Our USIS data acquisition -- our USIS data ex-acquisition from July 2018, which brought a unique set of US near and subprime consumer data is also performing well and ahead of plan. M&A is an important growth lever for Equifax and we continue to look for new opportunities to expand our data sets around the globe through M&A. So wrapping up, this was a pivotal quarter for Equifax, which we delivered several important steps forward toward our goal of returning Equifax to market leadership and growth. Number one, Monday's legal and regulatory settlements was a big step forward for Equifax by resolving a significant issues including the consumer class action, State Attorney Generals, FTC, CFPB and New York Department of Financial Services facing as following the 2017 cyber event. This resolution allows us to more fully focus on operating and growing Equifax and driving our technology and data security transformation. Second, second quarter was a solid performance for Equifax operationally. EWS delivered very strong top line verification growth with expanding margins and it's a clear franchise business for Equifax. USIS took another big step toward the recovery with 2.5% growth and 10% online results. We are focused on second half execution in International after a disappointing second quarter results with some macro headwinds in Australia, Argentina and the UK. Third, we continue to execute on our EFX 2020 cloud technology and data security investments. As we discussed last quarter, we are convinced that our move to the cloud will differentiate Equifax from competition and deliver always on capabilities, bring speed of new products to market, allow us the ability to move products and technology more quickly across our global platform and we expect the investment to enhance our revenue growth and deliver double-digit savings to our technology spend and capitalized development costs. And last, we continue to execute on our strategy of adding strategic acquisitions. PayNet is a great example of the kind of bolt-on acquisitions we will look to add to the Equifax portfolio. And looking for ways to leverage our differentiated assets and decisioning assets with partnerships like Fokko. We know we still have a lot of work to do, but we are energized about the momentum behind our EFX 2020 initiatives and we expect continued positive operating progress through the balance of 2019. I'm more excited than ever about our future as a market-leading data analytics and technology company. John will share more detail, but we remain committed to our prior 2019 guidance, adjusted for the financing costs from the settlement payments. With that let me turn it over to John. John Gamble : Thanks, Mark and good morning, everyone. I will generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis, but will refer to non-GAAP results, as well. As Mark covered our overall results and the business unit details, I'll cover some corporate items overall margins, free cash flow and our guidance. The finalization of the Consumer Settlement was a significant step forward for Equifax and we now have a clear view of the timing of near term payments including to the MSAG, CFPB and NYDFS and the initial $25 million contribution to the consumer restitution fund. In total, we expect to make about $350 million in payments in 3Q'19 against the $701 million in charges taken in the first half of '19. We intend to fund this initially with commercial paper issuance and have included related interest expense of about $0.03 per share in second half '19 in our guidance. The timing of the remaining approximately $350 million payment to the consumer restitution fund is uncertain, but not expected to be made before 1Q '20 and we therefore have not included any interest costs related to this payment in our guidance. As Mark mentioned, we continue to make good progress with our technology transformation. This includes progress in estimating cost savings, we hope to achieve, when we have fully executed the transformation and the incremental capital to execute the transformation is fully depreciated. There are 2 areas in which we initially see savings. First , we have estimated the savings we hope to achieve in the technology portion of our cost of goods sold. Based on analysis of cost to operate our US consumer credit exchange at GCP in a virtual private cloud versus our current premise-based system. This analysis was done both working with our technology partner GCP and compared to general studies from industry consultants. Based on this analysis, we hope to achieve savings in the technology portion of our cost of goods sold of 15 plus percent. For perspective, our technology cost represents just over half of our total COGS excluding any one-time costs related to the technology, and data security transformation second is development capital and expense. The move to dramatically more standard cloud native offerings should substantially reduce our cost to develop and deploy new products and applications. Our belief is, on the order of 25%, this impacts both development capital and expense. We will continue to refine our view on cost savings in the second half, when we cost our EWS twin database on the data fabric. We remain energized about the top and bottom line benefits of our technology transformation. For all of 2019, US mortgage market inquiries are expected to decline slightly versus 2018, which is stronger than the down 2% we had expected in May. 2Q '19 inquiries were up 2% versus the down 1% we had expected In May, increase in 3Q '19 and 4Q '19 are expected to be up 3% and 4% respectively. We are on track to deliver the savings from the resource realignment we executed in 4Q '18 and first half of '19. Total savings from the two combined actions are expected to exceed $60 million in 2019 with second half savings exceeding first half by about $10 million. Savings were generated across FX, but were most substantial incorporate international and at Workforce Solutions. In the second quarter, general corporate expense was $135 million excluding the non-recurring costs associated with the 2017 cybersecurity incident and technology transformation, the adjusted general corporate expense for the quarter was $68 million, up $5 million from 2Q '18 but better than we had expected. The increase versus 2Q '18 predominantly reflects the increased investment in security and transformation and related technology, as we ramp of those costs in first half '18 and increased variable compensation given the timing of hiring certain executives last year. This was partially offset by savings from our 4Q '18 and 1Q '19 restructuring plans. We expect 3Q '19 and 4Q '19 corporate expenses on average to be at the levels similar to 1Q '19. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 33.7% in 2Q '19 down 130 basis points from 2Q '18 and better than our expectations. As we discussed in May and as is covered in Mark's results -- comments, the decline in overall adjusted EBITDA margins year-to-year is principally driven by global consumer, principally due to the reduced consumer direct revenue and a return to marketing spend in 2019. We expect substantially improved margins at GCS in second half of '19 as revenue begins to recover and they benefit from cost containment actions taken in the first half. International and USIS also saw margins decline, but to a much less extent than GCS. Strong growth in margins at Workforce Solutions partially offset these declines. For 2Q '19 the effective tax rate used in calculating adjusted EPS was 24.6% in line with our guidance. We expect our calendar year '19 tax rate used for adjusted EPS to be just under 24.5% 3Q '19 tax rate should be below 23%. In 2Q '19 and first-half '19 operating cash flow of $217 million and $248 million were down $18 million and $107 million respectively, from 2018. For both periods, these declines were more than driven by the following non-recurring items. In 2Q '18 and first half '18 Equifax received $45 million and $80 million respectively of insurance proceeds offsetting costs incurred related to the cybersecurity incident. Equifax received no proceeds in 2019. 2Q '19 and first half '19 investments in security and transformation of $82 million and $179 million were up $10 million and $28 million respectively from 2018. And payments in 2Q '19 and the first half of '19 related to the $57 million of charges taken in 4Q '18 and 1Q '19 for cost reductions were $10 million and $21 million respectively. Capital spending or the incurred cost of capital projects in 2Q '19 and first half of '19 were $103 million and $98 million, up $11 million and $49 million respectively from 2018. We expect capital spending to be about $385 million for the full year, higher than our original guidance of $365 million reflecting incremental spend on our technology transformation. Excluding payments related to settlements of litigation or regulatory actions, as we look forward, we expect to deliver positive free cash flow in the second half of '19 and for the full year 2019 free cash flow should exceed $200 million. Now turning to our guidance for 3Q '19 and full year 2019. For 3Q '19, we expect revenue to be $865 million to $880 million, up 4.5% to 6% in constant currency. Mortgage inquiries are expected to be up 3% and FX is expected to negatively impact revenue by about 1.5%. Adjusted EPS is expected to be 1.41 to 1.46 per share. FX is expected to impact adjusted EPS negatively by $0.02 per share and lower tax benefits in 3Q '19 versus 3Q '18 are expected to negatively impact adjusted EPS by about $0.06 per share. Our improved revenue growth in 3Q reflects growth acceleration at USIS, continued strong growth at Workforce, international moving back toward more normal growth levels and GCS moving back toward flat revenue. Adjusted EPS also returns to growth in 3Q. This despite tax is representing about a $0.06 per share or 4 percentage point headwind versus 3Q '18. 3Q '18 had a low tax rate of below 19% due to discrete benefits that will not be repeated in 3Q '19. We are seeing nice growth in operating income in the quarter. The full year 2019 guidance we provided in March and May of this year, excluded the impact of any significant settlement charges. This quarter, we are including in our guidance, the financing cost of funding the Consumer Settlement. Our 2019 guidance ranges for Equifax revenue is unchanged from the previous guidance we provided in May with revenue between $3.425 billion and $3.525 billion. Our adjusted EPS guidance range is being adjusted by the $0.03 per share for the cost of financing the Consumer Settlement, and is now between $5.57 and $5.77 per share. We expect revenue to be above the midpoint of the range and adjusted EPS to be toward the bottom of the range. Our guidance for 3Q '19 and 2019 implies a strong 4th quarter with better than seasonal sequential growth in revenue and operating profit. Looking at 4Q revenue, we expect strong sequential growth to be seen in USIS reflecting the normal seasonal growth and financial marketing services and a better than normal sequential performance in online. Workforce will continue to show strong growth, better than their seasonal pattern, particularly in verifier and international should show sequential growth in 4Q, but consistent with seasonal patterns. GCS revenue is expected to strengthen as we move through 2019. In terms of operating profit, we expect the 4Q '19 stronger than seasonal sequential revenue growth to deliver stronger than normal sequential BU operating profit growth. This, along with the cost reduction announced in 4Q '19 in first half '19 and cost containment actions being executed will further benefit sequential margins in International, GCS and Workforce as well as corporate. Delivering our second half performance requires strong execution across our commercial teams as well as continued focus on firmly managing costs throughout 2019. And with that operator, we'll now open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead. Manav Patnaik : Thank you, good morning, guys. Mark, in your prepared remarks you talked -- I think you alluded a little bit too, but you still being a little cautious. And I was wondering if you could just elaborate on that in terms of -- is the recovery or the better results you're seeing and guiding more sort of catch up from what you lost. So maybe, can you just elaborate a little bit more on the competitive environment and your visibility improvement? Mark Begor : Yeah, Manav, it's a great question. We do still remain cautious. We kind of had now three  quarters from USIS, where they've delivered either at or above our expectations. And as I mentioned -- John and I mentioned, second quarter is one of those, and we're very pleased with the online growth. We also mentioned the growing pipeline in USIS, which is a really positive sign. We're really pleased with the new leader. But then you look at some of the businesses, for example, our financial marketing services business, they had a strong first quarter. I think we talked about that in May, that we thought that, was probably a bit stronger than what we expected, because of a couple of large deals and then in the second quarter, they were below our expectations and that business is still on its recovery mode. So we're very pleased. I think I used the words that second quarter was a very strong step forward for USIS. It's a business that competitively we're in the marketplace, we have yield pipelines that are up 30% from year end and 2x from 18 months ago, there is no question that we are back in the marketplace. I'm really pleased with our leader there, who's no longer new to this sort of things. He's bringing really commercial leadership, but it still takes time to rebuild all of those relationships and as you know the deal closing pipeline while we are seeing some progress on that conversion, that's still not at a historical level. So I think that's what we are still watching. But we've laid our guidance for the second half, where we expect that business to continue grow and recover as we go through the second half. Manav Patnaik : Got it. And then just another one from me. Just on the tax savings you talked about or at least referred to, just to clarify, like maybe some color on the timing around which, do you think you can get there? Is that the end state or is that kind of what the project should deliver without the other costs along the way where we might not see the absolute 16% and 25% that you guys referred to. Mark Begor : Yeah, what we're trying to do Manav is, give some visibility to what we expect this cloud transformation to deliver and as, you know, in the last 90 days or so, we're starting to share with you and other investors where we see some of the cost benefits, that's probably easier piece and they're quite substantial. And when you just talk about the cost benefits, those numbers, we've talked about the 15 to 20 on our tech costs in 25% on our development costs, those are on a run rate basis when we're fully completed and we're not giving visibility yet past 2019, but we've also talked about the fact that we expect those benefits to roll into 2019, 2020 as we work through the full implementation of this technology transformation. And we're just not ready to give a date when these benefits will fall to the bottom line. We're also working to try to quantify what our expectations are about the topline benefits, we think we're always on capability, the speed to market, the ability to move products around the globe, we're also going to help us on our topline. So we're going to have additional costs which we try to -- it's in our guidance for 2019, we'll put it in our guidance for 2020 around the tech transformation and migration. And then we should start seeing benefits as we retire legacy debt this year and next year and we'll give guidance once we are ready to do so, on what we think the full transformation is going to deliver, we're just trying to give some perspectives that we think it's going to be quite positive for Equifax. All right. Got it. Thanks a lot. Mark Begor : Thanks, Manav. Operator : We'll take our next question from Judah Efram Sokel with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Judah Efram Sokel : Hi, thank you for taking my question. First one is just about guidance for EPS for the year. I just wanted to make sure I understood that the total change to guidance was simply because of the interest expense related to the settlement or is there any other shifting of costs, perhaps an acceleration of the tech, tech spending, as you mentioned the 350? Mark Begor : The guidance that John shared is, we're sticking to our prior guidance with only the change of the financing cost we have from the settlement payments in the second half. That's the only change we are making. Judah Efram Sokel : Okay, perfect. And then my other question was just around USIS margins, you had a lot of helpful color on margins in the other segments as well as revenues. I was just wondering if you could help us think through more specifically USIS margin expectations for the back half of '19. Mark Begor : Yeah. So our expectation is, I think we've mentioned in the script is, we're expecting USIS margins to also improve as we get through the back half of '19. As their revenue continues to grow, since we're seeing nice growth in online, the expectation is, we'll see continued improvement in margins as the online variable margins are very high. Judah Efram Sokel : All right, thanks. Operator : We'll take our next question from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Thanks so much. Hey, really helpful color on the TTI initiative around the expense. I know it's early in terms of quantifying what the revenue could be, but is there a way to kind of frame it relative to kind of NPI where you'd expect it to be above that. And then just within the context to the FICO partnership, when should we start to see the revenue associated with that kind of start to come into the numbers, and I don't think there's anything in the guide for that, is that right? Mark Begor : Yeah. Thanks, Kevin. On your first one, we're not ready to talk about what our expectations are around the revenue. And we tried to give some color on the expense benefits from our cloud transformation. So, I guess, stay tuned. As we work to refine that, we want to share that with you as we bring it forward. But we clearly believe it's going to be positive for Equifax on the top line and that's as far as we've gotten on that. On the FICO partnership, we're in the marketplace, we've got joint deal pipelines, we haven't landed any revenue yet, nor we've given any revenue guidance on that, and my guess is it, we won't give specific guidance on that revenue. It will be a part of Equifax's revenue and of course FICO is going to benefit from two as part of our joint revenue sharing in that. But I just wanted to give an update to you and other investors that, that project is continuing, there is great momentum with it and there's really positive customer reaction to it, particularly around the Data Decisions Cloud where we're combining FICO's decisioning software with Equifax's Ignite InterConnect and Hardline piping in our data. And we believe that there'll be a set of customers that are going to really be attracted to that turnkey solution as well as the other products that we're working to bring to the marketplace. Kevin McVeigh : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from George Mihalos with Cowen. Please go ahead. George Mihalos : Hey, good morning, guys. Wanted to ask on the international side, specifically for APAC now, as the comps sees in the back half of the year, it sounds like you're expecting a return to modest growth over the back half, but then as we start going into 2020 and all the progress you've made related to positive data, would you expect positive data initiative to benefit APAC growth in as early as 2020? Mark Begor : Yeah, we're not ready to give 2020 guidance, of course, but we've been consistent around -- we believe positive data is going to be attractive to our Australia business and we expect some benefits in the second half. And as we get closer to 2020, we will give you some perspective on 2020, but it really goes to the premise that more data is going to be attractive for us and it's going to be more data is going be attractive for our customers and it more data opens up more revenue opportunity source. George Mihalos : Okay. And then, John, just a point of clarification, if we look at USIS revenue growth of 2.5% I think as you talked about, if we look at that organically -- your -- it's down slightly. I think something like 50 bps or the math work, something like that. If we sort of adjust for the impact from mortgage solutions, thanks to the mixed shift which again is kind of voluntary and the benefit that you've gotten from mortgage in the quarter. Is it safe to say that sort of on a normalized basis USIS were sort of sort of flatish. John Gamble : Now, it's up about one, right. I think we try to put that in the script. I think it's up about one. And again, as you look forward, right, so we're seeing nice progress in online as Mark talked about quite completely and then the financial marketing services was down in the quarter and we expect to see growth in financial marketing services, when we get into the back half. So when you think about why are we getting comfortable that we're going to see some improved growth out of USIS? It's really the momentum in online and then financial marketing services starting to grow again. And those two pieces that we need to deliver on clearly, it requires execution. As Mark said, lots of execution for that to be true, but that's the basis on which we're getting comfortable, we're going to see improved performance in the back half. George Mihalos : Okay, thank you. John Gamble : Further improve. It was already been improving, further improved performance. Operator : We'll take our next question from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Toni Kaplan : Thank you. I'm still not a 100% clear on the EPS guide. So, you mentioned you lowered the guide by $0.03 from the interest expense and then -- but you beat this quarter by like $0.05, $0.055 and now you're saying you'll comment toward the bottom end of the range. So I'm essentially thinking of that as outside of the interest expense, basically up to $0.15 guide down and so I just -- I'm not understanding what's driving that? Mark Begor : Our full year guidance, as we said, was only adjusted for the $0.03. Yes, we had a good quarter and as we talked about last quarter, right. For us to deliver the full year, we needed to have very strong execution as we were expecting substantial improvement in USIS and then across the business broadly. And I think what you saw in the second quarter is good direction toward the improvement that was necessary for us to be able to deliver the full year that we talked about in May. And that's why we repeated the guide here that we did in July. So, the execution to continue to show the improvement that's necessary for us to deliver the year, I think it's what you're seeing in our guidance and hopefully improve confidence in our ability to deliver it. And that's very important to us and that's where we're focused. Toni Kaplan : Okay. And then on M&A, from your comments, it sounded like acquisitions contributed over 250 basis points or roughly to USIS a little higher than what I was thinking, should that continue? Is that the main driver of the revenue guide being above the mid point now? Thank you. Mark Begor : No, no. So again you got to remember DataX was acquired in July of last year. So we are like most companies right -- we -- in our organic calculation, we just -- we consider the acquisition for its first year to be incremental. But beyond -- now that we have comparable period starting in July, that will move to organic. Right. So it isn't driven just by acquisitions. You're seeing improved performance broadly. And again, you can see a nice big step up. Hopefully, on year-over-year in FMS. Toni Kaplan : Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Ashish Sabadra : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just a quick question on the FMS improvement going forward, is that related to the timing of closing the deals, which got pushed out from the second to third quarter? John Gamble : No, I think as Mark talked about, we closed some large deals in 1Q that just didn't repeat in 2Q. I don't think we made any comment about anything pushing out. I think the comfort we have is that if you take a look over some longer periods, we said it's choppy. Right. So if you want to kind of watch the choppiness out of the results, you will look over slightly longer periods and over those longer periods basically, we've been performing kind of flat over the past nine months. So we feel we are getting comfortable that we've stabilized at that flat level and we're starting to see funnels grow and our expectation is better performance as we get into the back half. So, that's really what it is. If you go back to last year, we'd said, well, you'll start to see improvement in our sales execution as we got into the back half of '19 based on the fact that we had a year to sell once we were free to sell again, following the cybersecurity incident. And effectively our forecast for USIS represent success at that model. So again, as we said, we need to execute, and it is a substantial effort for us to do but that's what's built into our forecast. Our forecast assumes success in that selling effort and therefore growth in those businesses. Mark Begor : I think I'd add to that that we gave you some visibility around the USIS new deal pipeline, which includes FMS in there and that's up substantially from a year ago. And of course up substantially from the beginning of the year. So that continues to built. So that gives us some of the confidence that the teams out there in real commercial discussions of transactions that will benefit the second half and I think John mentioned in FMS that it's also seasonality that typically a stronger in the second half and of course, last year we were still working on the post cyber. We view that we're a more normal commercial -- in a very normal commercial mode today versus where we were a year ago. Ashish Sabadra : That's very helpful. And maybe just and why; as we saw some pretty good improvement even excluding PayNet and mortgage. How -- can you just give any more color on any particular verticals or products that drove that strength. Thanks. John Gamble : And I guess I think Mark included in his script, right. We saw some strength in insurance, some strengthening and performance in government. Identity and fraud, which are really separate business has also performed better and nicely and saw some growth and quite honestly the momentum and banking lending is improving. Now banking and lending obviously has the acquisitions in it, but the momentum is improving and we're expecting that momentum to yield in the second half. So those are all areas where we feel -- where we had improving performance in the second quarter and are expecting continued performance going forward. Operator : Thank you. And our next question from Tim McHugh with William Blair & Company. Please go ahead. Tim McHugh : Yes, thanks. Just wanted to add a higher level talk about maybe the technology transformation. This may be too high of a summary. But I think you talked a little bit about some small parts of the projects that are -- maybe started or a little bit delayed relative to the original plan, you also talked about spending more than you had originally planned this year. I guess. I think the spending was conveyed in a sense of strength in terms of opportunities to do this, but I think just to address the question, I'm sure I'll get questions from people who will take those other two data point and try and talk about the difficulty of the project. So can you just in that context maybe talk about how you're progressing and I guess the confidence and the kind of the pathway that you've laid out to achieve the overall technology transformation? Mark Begor : Yeah, first off on the spend. I think we tried to be clear Tim that our current forecast is to spend what we've already committed to you, so no change in that. We did give the caveat that, if we see some opportunities to accelerate migrations in particular, we might spend a little bit more. But it's going to be in that same framework. We're not having overruns or things like that, we didn't want to give that impression, because that's not the case. The one area that was a bit more complex than I think we anticipated over the last 90 days with the build-out of the data fabric at Google Cloud, that's now complete. We had hope to complete that maybe 30 to 45 days earlier. But it was completed a month ago and it's in the hands of all the business teams. But we're just trying to be transparent. This is a big project. There's a lot of pieces to it. One of the ways we try to derisk is it was breaking it down into pieces and are -- we're attempting to just be transparent and what you know where we're going on it and how it's progressing. Overall, we're very pleased with the progress, the teams are embracing it. Customers are very excited about it. Our dialogs with customers about the overall investment, where we're going to take it, the benefits they're going to get, as well as the migrations of things like InterConnect and Ignite to the cloud environment are very, very positive. John Gamble : And, Tim, capital is up a bit. We did say capital would be up a bit in the year. And I think the way you should think about that is, capital is more driven by build than migration. Right. So I think as Mark talked about, data fabric is built and moving InterConnect built and moving, we made some commitments around and are executing against things we're doing very nicely with Ignite and integrating Ignite and InterConnect, that's all build. Right. And then also quite honestly, when we gave the guidance in the beginning of the year, the investments we are going to need to make to do important partnerships like FICO weren't necessarily in our guidance at the time. So you're seeing increasing spend around some of those things, but it's more around the build activity which is upfront and then the migration activity. So I think you should view it as good progress and in the context of the $700 million to spend or just over $700 million to spend, we're talking about, we still think we're in a pretty narrow band with an adjustment during the year of about $20 million. So we're not feeling like there's big overruns, as Mark indicated, and the capital is really around the build segment, which we think is progressing and some things have been added that weren't in the original guidance that we gave you back in February. Tim McHugh : Okay, great, thanks. That's all I had. Operator : We'll take our next question from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, please go ahead. Gary Bisbee : Hi, good morning and thanks for the commentary on how you're thinking about savings over time from the technology program. I guess one area of that, that we haven't heard a lot about is how you're thinking about potential reinvestment for a portion of those savings? Would it be right to think that a lot of that fall to the bottom line or are you more likely to reinvest a significant portion of that as you continue to drive innovation and trying to drive the topline? Mark Begor : Yeah, it's a great question, Gary. And as you might imagine that's one that we're thinking a lot about and we're not at this stage to talk about it. And of course, we're not at the stage where we're ready to put our financial framework, back in place. But there is no question we expect there to be benefits. We're going to look hard at what portion of those benefits that we plowed into more new products, into more growth and what portion do we bring to the bottom line to increase our margins and we'll have some clarity on that as time progresses and share it with you. Gary Bisbee : Okay. And then just the follow-up to that. In a couple of public appearances during the quarter, it sounded like you were indicating that completion of the program could slip beyond 12/31/2020 timeline initially, is that -- I just wanted to get your latest thoughts on that, is mid 2021 more realistic target given what you know at this point or where you are thinking today. Thank you. Mark Begor : Yeah. What we tried to do, Gary, in all of our discussions is to be clear with you that our intent is that the incremental spend that we have in ' 18, '19 and '20 will end in the end of next year and then anything that's left to be done, and there certainly will be elements of this cloud transformation that is going to flow into 2021. It's not going to be 100% complete. We do expect to complete a lot of the work between now and the end of next year and then anything that's required after that, our intention is, that, that would go into our normal operating expenses and normal capitalized costs as opposed to the incremental spend that we've been doing for the last 18 months and then we plan to continue for the next 18 months that was the kind of boundary we put around it and we're still sticking to that. Gary Bisbee : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Bill Warmington : Good morning , everyone. So I feel like it's been a while since we've heard anything about the commercial business. It used to be its own division up until a few years ago and -- but now we've done an acquisition of PayNet which is B2B data around commercial lending and leasing. And then you also mentioned strength in the USIS B2B business. So I wanted to ask, what's changed there and how are you thinking about the B2B business going forward? Mark Begor : Yeah, it's still an important business for us. As you know, that's why we made the PayNet acquisition, because we knew we'd enhance our position commercially. In the earlier comments when we talked about B2B, that was really referring to our online business with our normal customers versus the commercial business. Bill Warmington : Got it. Mark Begor : The business is, we didn't talk about it in our prepared remarks, but had growth in the quarter that was similar to the overall business, so it's performing quite well. John Gamble : Ex-PayNet the commercial business has actually done very nicely this year and with PayNet it's only accelerating. So as you know, as you remember that we made substantial investments in building out the CFM and that's improving. We did, -- we integrated SBFE. So we think we have a very good partnership here, we announced earlier in the year that we are one of the -- we're very early and think we have outstanding risk scores in commercial and have won some significant new customers. So that business was making progress on its own. And with PayNet we think it's going to accelerate. I think it's been going -- we mentioned on the May call that we were so impressed with the PayNet leader that, he is now leading our US commercial business, which combines our core commercial business with the new PayNet assets and business. And we're really energized about the last 60 days as he's been out in the marketplace really driving that business Bill Warmington : And then, a housekeeping question. You didn't explicitly give the organic revenue growth for the 3rd quarter, I just wanted to check that it, it looks like it's probably about 2.5% to 3% by just need to run that by you. Mark Begor : Yeah, we didn't give guidance on organic growth in the 3rd quarter. So you are correct. We did not. But, again, please remember right that DataX is no longer inorganic starting in July. Right. So because we acquired them a year ago to this month, so the amount of acquisition revenue actually declines. Bill Warmington : Got it. Okay. Mark Begor : From DataX. Bill Warmington : Okay, got it. All right, well thank you very much. Mark Begor : Thanks, Bill. Operator : Our next question will come from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Please go ahead. Jeff Meuler : Yeah, thanks. Mark, question on pipeline conversion in USIS. And I guess what I'm wondering is, is the slower conversion and historical -- is it just a function of, you've had a lot come into the pipe recently, so therefore is that an earlier stage, but it's progressing through as normal or has the selling motion and hurdles that your clients are putting you through changed because of the breach or maybe some other factors, just -- can you just help shape it up for us, please? Mark Begor : Yeah, it's definitely not the latter, Jeff. We're in normal commercial mode and there is no change I would characterize it today than it was in 2017 prior to the cybersecurity breach. If anything, our commercial discussions are more positive, meaning that we've got a dialog around new data assets, we've got a dialog around our technology transformation and how we're going to deliver more capabilities to our customers. Your comments in the pipeline, were right on. The pipeline, as we said is up 2X over what it was at the beginning of last year and is up strong double digits, from the beginning of the year. So the pipeline is growing. And as you pointed out, some of those opportunities are newer and the lifecycle on those on when they get actually converted, vary -- everyone varies, but generally newer items have a longer tail on them than more mature items in the pipeline. So really good news that the pipeline is growing and is at increasingly high levels and the comments about -- we continue to be watching the conversion is, it's just not fully mature yet, when we'll get there is hard to forecast as far as maturity to pipeline, but clearly every day we're getting closer to that. And it should continue to progress in the 3rd quarter and 4th quarter, and our leader there, Sid Singh, who is driving the business is really bringing a lot of drive and energy around the commercial side of the business and of course I'm still spending a bunch of time with our US customers to continue to help drive the USIS return to their historical growth. Jeff Meuler : Okay. And then let me take a 3rd shot at EPS guidance question. So I'll ask it this way, you're guiding revenue above the midpoint of the prior range, you're guiding EPS to the low end and what's typically a good incremental margin business. So is the offset something with mix, with, I don't know, UK and Australia, or is there increased investment just if you could maybe the 3rd time is a charm, I think. Mark Begor : So, I think as you take a look at our back half, what you'll see in our back half is improving revenue growth and growing margins, right. So what I suggest we do is, not look at this kind of relative to guidance movements, but relative to absolute performance. And I think what you're seeing is, improvements across both and that's what we would expect to try to deliver and it is what we think we're delivering. Jeff Meuler : Okay, thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. George Tong : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Online Information Systems has accelerated to 10% growth in the second quarter, can you break out how much of the growth is coming from PayNet and how much is coming from improving underlying performance post the data breach? John Gamble : Yeah. So, George, we gave organic growth and it's at Mark Begor : 36%. John Gamble : Yes. So of the 10, 4 was 4 was through from acquisitions and that's just not PayNet, that would be DataX as well. Right. Because data was, as we said, bought in July of last year. George Tong : Right. And if you were to break out the impact between PayNet and DataX instead X will be rolling off next quarter, how would you split the difference? John Gamble : Yeah, we didn't give revenue of each, but they were not that different in size. George Tong : Got it, that's helpful. And then, a follow-up question around margins, your EBITDA margins contracted 130 bps year-over-year in the second quarter. Can you discuss what expectations for margins in the second half of the year are embedded in your full year guidance and what factors you have that you see that can drive better margin performance in the second half? John Gamble : Yeah. So again, we think our margin performance improves as we go through the year and again that's driven by the growth rates we're seeing in revenue, in general. Right. So I think it's similar -- similar to the answer I gave to the last question, it's really the same here. And that's our expectation, as we go through the rest of the year. I think as you take a look at our EPS guidance relative to our revenue guidance, again, you're starting to see us forecasting improved EPS -- adjusted EPS, sorry, in the second half and that would go along with the improved -- the improving overall profitability. Operator : Our next question will come from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, thank you very much for taking my questions. Could you just talk a little bit about the competitive situation in online? I'm just trying to understand was the 6% organic growth coming from white space that you guys have created with some of your NPI or you just become more competitive in the marketplace? Are you taking business from a competitor? Can you just kind of talk about that a little bit and then I'll have a follow-up. Mark Begor : Yes, it's pretty broad base. It's hard to put on one item. We're clearly back in the marketplace. We're working with existing customers to try to increase our share with those customers, so that's helpful . I think we talked about the fact that we reentered the FinTech space really 12 months ago, and we've got almost a dozen commercial people there and so that's I'm talking about the US, which is your question. So there are some wins happening there in the marketplace. And then, as you pointed out, we're in there with NPIs I'll leave PayNet and DataX out of it, just talk the organic phase, we're in there with NPIs that drive new online volume, and it's fairly broad-based and it's what you would hope to see with equifax, getting back into a more normal commercial mode. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. And then, I guess, a similar vein type a question just on the UK. If I could look at the UK performance versus say, like, what I'm seeing from call credit. Now, I understand that there is different mix of business over there, but it still seems like there's a dichotomy between the growth that you guys are having and what they are having. Can you talk to that a little bit or do you compete with them directly. Is it really a difference in mix, and like-for-like you think you've grow on the same way, if you could just elaborate on that? Mark Begor : I think we talked about that we've seen some pressure from Brexit in just some of the NPIs in the UK. We didn't expect that, we didn't see it in the first quarter. So there was some pressure there. We talked about -- are you focused on the credit side, the debt management business, I think we talked about some new business from UK government moved over from second quarter into in the third quarter. So we're expecting that business to get better as we go into the second half, it's hard to forecast the Brexit impact, but we're watching that business closely. John Gamble : And if you look at our credit business, right, we set our online business grew mid single-digit and have been growing high single-digit , which we think is very good and probably consistent with what you're seeing from other people actually, I think there has been other results reported in the quarter that, that were not quite that high. Right . So the difference for us was our -- was offline right, was the back -- was the deal business and we just had an execution issue in the second quarter, it's relatively , it's basically consolidated to that. So our expectation is -- as online will continue to perform and that will improve our execution in the back half. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. Can I just squeeze in one last thing just on the settlement. There is going to be another $350 million or so that gets paid in 1Q '20 is that the way to understand that? Mark Begor : We don't have clarity on the timing of that payment as we've tried to be clear. It could be, you know, as soon as then, it's driven by the court approval process and when we have clarity, then we'll share with you. Shlomo Rosenbaum : And there is highly unlikely to be 7 million people signing up for this. What happens if there is excess funds? Does that get kicked back to you, they gets absorbed by other sales? Mark Begor : No, it stays in the fund and there is various ways that is used to fund other consumer activities, but the consumer benefits, but nothing comes back to Equifax. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Got it. Thank you so much. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Trevor Burns for any additional or closing remarks. Trevor Burns : Thanks everybody for joining the call and I'll be around today if anybody has any questions. Thank you. Operator : This does conclude today's call, thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Today's conference is being recorded and at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to John Gamble. Please go ahead, sir. John Gamble : Thanks and good morning, welcome to today's conference call. I'm John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. With me today is Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com. During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements including fourth quarter and full year 2019 guidance to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC including our 2018 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. Also, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted revenue, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. For the third quarter of 2019, adjusted revenue excludes one-time settlements in the third quarter of 2019 with commercial customers. Adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes one-time settlements with commercial customers in 3Q 2019, costs associated with acquisition-related amortization expense, the income tax effect of stock awards recognized upon vesting or settlement, the foreign currency losses from remeasuring the Argentinean peso-denominated net monetary assets. Adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax also excludes legal and professional fees related to the 2019 cybersecurity incident, principally fees related to our outstanding litigation and government investigations, as well as the incremental non-recurring project cost designed to enhance our technology and data security. This includes projects to implement systems and processes to enhance our technology, and data security infrastructure, as well as projects to replace and substantially consolidate our global networks and systems, as well as the cost to manage these projects. These projects that will transform our technology transformation and further enhance our data security, were incurred throughout 2018 are expected to occur in 2019 and 2020. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to Equifax adding back interest expense, net of interest income, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization and also as is the case for adjusted EPS, excluding one-time settlements with commercial customers, cost related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident and foreign currency losses from remeasuring the Argentinean peso-denominated net monetary assets. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our website. Before Mark discusses our specific operating and financial results for the quarter, I wanted to address the $20 million in one-time commercial resolutions with two USIS commercial customers we recorded in the third quarter. These commercial resolutions related to issues that occurred prior to this year. As these settlements were to resolve commercial disputes, they were treated under GAAP as a reduction to revenue in the quarter.  Due to the size and one-time nature of these commercial resolutions, we have excluded them in our adjusted results. As Mark and I discuss results for the third quarter of 2019, we will be discussing revenue excluding these one-time revenue adjustments.  Over the next couple of months, Trevor Burns who leads the Equifax Investor Relations Group will be taking a medical leave of absence. In the interim, please direct any request for information or meeting requests to Valerie Robinson, at 404-885-8110 or to Valerie.robinson@equifax.com, that\u2019s valerie.robinson@equifax.com. Valerie will connect you with me or identify the appropriate Equifax resource to address your inquiry. Thank you for your patience in getting your inquiries resolved during this period of time.  Now I'd like to turn it over to, Mark. Mark Begor : Thanks, John, and good morning everyone. We were very pleased with our financial results for the third quarter. The third quarter results were broad based, showed sequential improvement or above guidance and were another very positive step forward for Equifax.  Adjusted revenue at $896 million was up 9% in constant currency and up 8% on an organic constant currency basis and well above our guidance. We had strong adjusted revenue growth driven by our U.S. businesses that were up 11% combined with Workforce Solutions up 19% and USIS up 9%, our strongest growth for both units in three years. Global consumer revenue was up slightly, its first period of growth in two years and international also showed 5% constant currency growth with Latin America, Canada and Asia-Pacific all showing growth in the quarter, but continue to be pressured by the slowdown in Australia and Brexit uncertainty in the UK.  U.S. mortgage revenue was much stronger than we expected in the quarter, as U.S. mortgage market increase were up almost 20% compared to the prior year. We also saw strength in our U.S. non-mortgage businesses with USIS and EWS, both showing accelerating year-to-year growth.  Our adjusted EBITDA margins advanced 90 basis points in the quarter, our first margin expansion in two years and our adjusted EPS of $1.48 per share was also above the top-end of the guidance we provided in July with those better business unit margins from stronger revenue growth, as well as the lower tax rate. USIS adjusted revenue was up 9% versus 2018 on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic basis.  Importantly, our non-mortgage revenue grew over 6% in the quarter and 3% organically compared to last year. The 3% non-mortgage organic growth was a positive sign of continued USIS strengthening versus the flattish performance we saw in the second quarter of 2019, but slightly weaker than we anticipated. Online adjusted revenue was up a strong 11.5% on a reported basis and up 8% on an organic basis, which was also a very positive sign of USIS recovery.  In addition to strong growth in mortgage, we saw growth in ID and fraud, as well as auto, insurance and government.  Mortgage solutions was down 6% in the quarter due to the mix shift we discussed previously with mortgage resellers which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2018, partially offset by the positive impact from the stronger mortgage markets. We expect a revenue headwind from this mortgage mix shift to decrease in the fourth quarter.  New product sales and implementations to mortgage lenders were also deferred as our customers focus on delivering the substantially higher mortgage volumes that they had in front of them. Financial Marketing Services adjusted revenue was up 8%, compared to last year and was better than our expectations. The growth in FMS reflects the growing pipeline that we discussed over the past couple of quarters. As we talked about last quarter, FMS growth is improving, but still choppy with year-to-date growth of about 2%.  As we look forward to the fourth quarter, we expect growth to be at or above the year-to-date growth rate. Sid Singh and the USIS team are laser-focused on growth and in moving to a normal commercial mode with their customers. Their new deal of pipeline is up 75% year-to-date with wins up 35% from 2018 positions them well for fourth quarter and 2020.  Growth in key verticals like banking and lending also is a very positive sign. The third quarter was another positive step forward for the USIS team as they work to return to a normal growth mode. We continue to believe our differentiated data assets coupled with our technology investments will return USIS to its traditional and historic growth mode.  We expect continued growth from USIS in fourth quarter, but we still remain cautious on the pace of their recovery. USIS EBITDA margins of $44.4% were down 180 basis points from third quarter 2018 primarily driven by increased royalty costs as well as higher product development expense and investments in commercial resources which we expect to benefit us in the future. Shifting to Workforce Solutions, they had an extremely strong quarter with revenue up 19% compared to last year which was better than our expectations. Verification Services was up a very strong 29% driven by broad based strong double-digit growth across mortgage, debt management, talent solutions, healthcare and government verticals.  The strong verification services revenue growth also reflects continued growth in work number active records as well as the rollout of new products. EWS and Verification Service revenue growth excluded the benefit \u2013 excluding the benefit of the mortgage market were up 13% and 20% respectively, which we are very pleased with. As we\u2019ve discussed in prior discussions, EWS has strong future growth potential as they continue to expand in existing verticals and rollout new products.  As I mentioned earlier, EWS continued to substantially grow their twin database. Twin now has over a 100 million active records and about 80 million active unique individuals in the United States. These compare to the roughly 165 million individuals in U.S. non-farm payroll. These twin record additions are huge accomplishments for Rudy Ploder and the EWS team, which drive higher hit rates for our customers and benefits the U.S. consumers. We expect to continue to grow the twin records in the future.  Employer services declined in the quarter 5%, slightly below our expectations, driven principally by workforce analytics, our ACA business, as well as unemployment claims businesses. Offsetting the decline in Workforce Analytics, we saw slight growth in our I-9 and onboarding business. We expect employer services revenue to decline mid-single-digit percentages in the fourth quarter.  The strong verifier revenue growth resulted in very strong adjusted EBITDA margins of 48.8%, an expansion in the quarter of 130 basis points. Margin expansion was dampened somewhat by incremental and costs incurred in the quarter by EWS to board some new Twin record contributors.  We expect EWS EBITDA margins to continue to be very strong in the fourth quarter. Workforce Solutions is a franchise business for Equifax and continues to perform exceptionally well. Shifting to international, their revenue was up 5% in local currency, but down on a reported basis by 2% and below our expectations. The majority of the weakness versus our expectations was in the UK and we expect it to continue in the fourth quarter with some of the Brexit uncertainty.  Asia-Pacific was up 2% in local currency in the third quarter as we begin to lap weakening in Australia consumer lending and commercial credit markets that began in the third quarter of 2018. The third quarter performance was also weaker than we anticipated.  In the third quarter, we saw some nice growth in Australia in our commercial business and our consumer business returned to nominal growth. Both of these, we see as positive signs for the future. We continue to see weakness in our Australian marketing service business, which we expect to continue into the fourth quarter.  Overall, Australia revenue was down slightly and slightly weaker than our expectation. While we are beginning to see stabilization in the Australia credit markets, we expect market growth to remain weak over the next several quarters, as a result we expect Australia revenue to hover around flat over the next couple of quarters.  We continue to make very good progress with positive data in Australia and by the end of the third quarter, we had almost 8% of positive data from Australian contributors. We expect this additional data to be a new lever for growth for our team in Australia in the future.  Our European business was flat in local currency in the third quarter and was weaker than our expectations in both our credit and debt management businesses. Our European credit business was up over 1% in local currency, an improvement from the down 1% in second quarter, but still weaker than the mid-to-high single-digit revenue growth we have seen over the past year. Consumer online and batch which represents about half of the credit revenue grew almost 4% in reseller and financial verticals, but this growth was offset by weakness in marketing services and insurance. Our European debt management business declined 3% in local currency or less than $1 million, principally driven by declines in our business with the UK government which was impacted by the continued Brexit uncertainty. We expect some limited improvement in our European business in the fourth quarter, principally in Spain. In the UK, our plans reflect continued slow growth from the continuing Brexit uncertainty and its impact on both our credit and debt management businesses.  Our Latin America business grew a strong 15% in local currency in the quarter. This has improved from second quarter growth of 8%. We saw a double-digit constant currency growth in Chile, Argentina, Ecuador, Uruguay and Mexico and high-single-digit constant currency growth in Paraguay. We are seeing growth accelerate as our Latin American businesses benefit from the expansion of Ignite rollouts and InterConnect SaaS rollouts and strong NPI rollouts from both 2017 and 2018 taking a hold in that region.  Canada grew almost 6% in local currency in the third quarter reflecting a continued focus on customer innovation and new products and we expect to see mid to high-single-digit growth in Canada in the fourth quarter. International adjusted EBITDA margins at 30.9% were up a 150 BPS in the quarter, principally reflecting higher revenue and margin in Australia and Latin America and from the cost actions taken in the fourth quarter of last year, and earlier in 2019.  Margins were lower than our expectations due to the weaker-than expected revenue performance. We expect international revenue growth in the fourth quarter to be at about similar levels to the third quarter and we believe this positive revenue growth, along with the full benefit of the cost reductions taken in the fourth quarter of last year and during 2019, we\u2019ll continue to improve margins in the fourth quarter. That said, we are watching our international business closely, particularly as the UK Brexit process unfolds.  Global Consumer Solutions revenue was up about 0.5% on a reported basis and up 1% on a constant currency basis in the quarter, a substantial improvement from a 6% decline in the second quarter. This is the first quarter of GCS revenue growth since the 2017 cybersecurity incident.  Our Global Consumer Direct business was down 5% and was just under half of our total GCS revenue. Our U.S. Consumer Direct business saw a revenue decline of 9% versus 2018. We are seeing subscriber additions from the restart of marketing in late 2018, however, at a lower rate, given our decision to slow advertising around our announcement of the legal settlements in July.  Our Canadian and UK direct businesses, both grew revenue in the quarter. Our GCS partner business which is slightly more than half of GCS revenue increased 6% in the quarter which we were pleased with. We expect our partner revenue growth to continue in the mid-single-digits in the fourth quarter. During December of 2018, we launched our new myEquifax membership program for U.S. consumers. To-date we\u2019ve registered over 2 million consumers and we expect this base to continue to grow in the coming months creating an attractive base across our products and services to those consumers.  Adjusted GCS EBITDA margins of 24.9% decreased 340 basis points as compared to the prior year. However, margins increased 200 basis points sequentially from the second quarter of 2019. As we expected in the third quarter we saw the effective revenue growth and the benefit of cost actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2018, and earlier this year.  Margins were also negatively impacted in the quarter by some one-time set up costs incurred during the quarter related to a new multi-year GCS contract. Our GCS business is clearly turning the corner and we expect continued revenue growth and margin expansion in the fourth quarter and into 2020.  Shifting now to our EFX 2020 technology transformation, we achieved some significant milestones again in the third quarter. First, we achieved a major milestone as we began running two data exchanges in production in our new cloud data fabric on GCP. Our U.S. consumer credit database replica or ACRO is in production on the data fabrics.  We are going to receive many benefits from having this database in a cloud format. One of the benefits of this cloud database structure allows us to deliver virtually streaming data and alerts to our customers.  During the quarter, we rolled out this market-leading capability to one of our large U.S. customers. Its real-time capability is increasingly important to many customers and is only possible on a cloud infrastructure. One of the many benefits we expect to come in the coming quarters as we continue to advance our cloud initiative.  Second in identity validation exchange that manages individual and household data using our identity products also moved to production on GCP this quarter. This was a full exchange migration with the legacy exchange being Sunset in early 2020. We are expecting significant further data fabric and exchange progress in the fourth quarter, as the work number and CTUE in our auto databases in the U.S. will be in production on our new cloud-based data fabrics using standard common native data fabric structures.  These are critical milestones for Equifax as the new data fabric capability allows us to easily access and build new products across these data assets with real speed and market-leading stability.  Also in the fourth quarter, Cambrian will be in production in our data fabric using cloud-native structures. We are expecting accelerating progress in the fourth quarter and first part of 2020 as our U.S. consumer and commercial credit IXI Wealth and Tax Forms Data Exchanges will also be in production in our new data fabric using our cloud-native structures.  We feel very good about our progress with data exchanges and data fabric as a part of our EFX 2020 technology transformation and we are clearly accelerating our migrations to our new cloud-based data fabric from legacy infrastructure.  Second, we continue to make very good progress in deploying our integrated online service platform that combines our Ignite Analytics Attribute management and modeling environments with our InterConnect interfaces and decisioning production platforms at AWS and shortly also at GCP. A number of new products for both consumer migration and new customers are available on this platform in the U.S. and select international markets today. Product availability will expand continuously with broad product availability in the U.S. expected to be \u2013 expected in the first half of 2020. Next in the third quarter, we made substantial progress deploying our new network fabric in the U.S., Europe and Australia.  This new network fabric allows us to move traffic securely and directly between Equifax, our customers and our virtual private cloud environments on GCP and AWS to substantially improve network performance and stability and strengthen our security.  Network performance is critical to allowing our customers and partners to take full advantage of the expanded services I discussed earlier. Our new network will deliver industry-leading performance to our customers.  Finally, the strong progress across data fabric, Ignite and Intertech deployment and product development in network fabric are the critical enablers that are supporting the migration of our customers from our legacy decisioning and interface systems onto our new native Ignite InterConnect product suite.  We are now seeing good progress in both collaborative planning, with customer migrations, as well as executing those migrations. Customer migrations will continue in the fourth quarter and accelerate as we enter 2020. We expect to complete the majority of USIS and EWS customer migrations by the end of 2020. And year-to-date, we have decommissioned five datacenters globally and these decommissionings will continue through the balance of the year and into 2020.  As we discussed previously, the benefits and savings we expect to deliver from our cloud technology transformation are driven by our move to a cloud-based infrastructure and a decommissioning of our legacy infrastructure and as you can see, we are making progress there.  I hope this gives you a sense of the positive progress we are making in our technology transformation that will deliver new cloud-based technology to our customers. We are laser-focused on execution and are making good progress with critical milestones achieved in the third quarter and good momentum as we move into fourth quarter and 2020.  Shifting now to new product innovation, this continues to be a key component of our EFX2020 strategy and a strong long-term muscle for Equifax. We have an active pipeline of new products at various stages in the funnel and we expect to launch about 70 products in 2019, which is up about 15% from last year and up from the guidance we gave you a few months ago.  Importantly, USIS product launches are expected to double in 2019 from 2018. We have prioritized our focus and resources on driving NPI rollouts in 2019 and plan to continue this focus in 2020. This is a very good sign as we collaborate with customers to bring new products to market. NPIs continue to be an important growth lever for Equifax. Across both USIS and Workforce Solutions, we are seeing good progress with our new identity validation and fraud identification products. InstaTouch ID Twin ID and Eligibility Advisor are helping commercial and government customers validate the identities of parties with whom they are interacting with through mobile and other digital devices. Our capabilities in identity and fraud will expand substantially in the fourth quarter with the launch of our new Luminate fraud and identity platform.  Shifting to the M&A and partnership front, in September, we announced a new strategic partnership with Urjanet, a leading aggregator of utility data that was delivering data from over 6500 utilities, telecom and cable providers. This new global partnership empowers consumers and businesses to share their payment data for a more complete picture of individual payment history, easier identity at verification and the potential for expanded access to credit. An average U.S. consumer has three to five relationships with their electric, gas, cable, satellite and telco providers which adds rich payment data to that provided and existing credit file. This alternative data partnership builds on our leadership in this space incorporating Urjanet\u2019s consumer permission data into our differentiated data assets.  Strategic partnerships like Urjanet are an important growth lever for Equifax and we continue to look for new opportunities to expand our datasets around the globe. The PayNet acquisition we executed earlier this year is performing very well with revenue growth accelerating to 15% since the acquisition. We are also seeing the improved coverage and predictability of the combined PayNet and Equifax commercial databases allowing us to win new business with new commercial lending, credit card and fin-tech customers.  Wrapping up, the third quarter was a very positive step forward for Equifax as we move back to our normal \u2013 as we work to move back to our normal growth mode. We delivered broad based growth with very strong double-digit growth at Workforce Solutions, improved sequential growth at USIS, our return to growth at Global Consumer, and stabilization in the international while they operate in some challenging markets.  This was the first in over two years that we delivered \u2013 first off \u2013 first also in over two years was that we delivered margin expansion while continuing to invest in our technology, security, new data assets, new products and expanded commercial resources.  Overall, we are very pleased to not only meet, but exceed our financial commitments and importantly, we achieved several critical milestones in our EFX2020 cloud technology transformation. We know that we still have a lot of work to do. We are energized about the positive progress of the business and the momentum behind our EFX2020 initiatives.  We expect continued positive progress during the balance of 2019 and into 2020. I am more excited than ever about our future as a market-leading data analytics and technology company and with that, let me turn it over to John. John Gamble : Thanks, Mark. I will generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis, but will refer to non-GAAP results, as well.  First, some perspective on 3Q 2019. 3Q 2019 adjusted revenue and EPS exceeded our guidance range and expectations substantially. Stronger than expected mortgage market inquiry growth benefited overall Equifax adjusted revenue by about $25 million, partially offsetting this adjusted revenue benefit were; international revenue was weaker than expected, principally in the UK and to a lesser extent in Australia.  Global consumer revenue and U.S. Consumer Direct was weaker than expected reflecting the impact of the recent settlements. And USIS showed continued progress and improved non-mortgage revenue growth, however saw some weakness in mortgage solutions and other areas.  FX movements in the quarter were negative to revenue by about $4 million more than expected. Adjusted EPS was also strong. About $0.05 per share stronger than the midpoint of our guidance or about $0.04 per share excluding the net of the $0.02 benefit of the lower tax rate and $0.01 more negative FX. Increased mortgage revenue did drive a meaningful benefit to income in the quarter.  The offsets to adjusted revenue that I just referenced also acted to partially offset this income benefit. In addition, negatively impacting costs were, Global Consumer and Workforce Solutions incurred the significant one-time startup and implementation cost that Mark referenced earlier. Development and implementation spend increased at both USIS and Workforce Solutions as we invested to reaccelerate NPI.  And in the second half of 2019, we are seeing increased depreciation in cloud costs as our transformed systems move into production. In the third quarter, total non-recurring or one-time cost related to the cybersecurity incident and our transformation were $77 million and consistent with expectations. This includes $65 million of technology and security, $10 million for legal and investigative fees and 42 million for product costs.  We expect 2019 one-time cost related to the cybersecurity incident and Equifax 2020 technology and data security transformation exclusive of any legal accruals to be about $350 million. For all of 2019, U.S. mortgage market increase were expected to be up about 7% versus 2018, which is stronger than the down 1% we had expected for July \u2013 for 2019 in July. 3Q 2019 inquiries were up almost 20% versus the up 3% we had expected in July. Inquiries in 4Q 2019 are expected to be up over 20%. We are on track to deliver the savings from the resource realignments we executed in 4Q 2018 and 2019. Total savings from the combined actions is expected to exceed $60 million in 2019. Savings were generated across Equifax but were more substantial in corporate international, the network force. In the third quarter, general corporate expense was $114 million excluding non-recurring costs. Adjusted corporate expense for the quarter was $70 million, up $3 million from 3Q '18 which is more than explained by increases in security and related technology and incentive comp accruals. This was in line with our expectations. We expect 4Q 2019 corporate expenses to be higher than 3Q 2019.  Adjusted EBITDA margin was 33.9% in 3Q '19, up 90 basis points from 3Q '18. As we discussed in July and as Mark covered in his remarks the increase in overall adjusted EBITDA margins year-to-year is principally driven by growth in margins at Workforce Solutions and in international, as well as leverage on corporate cost as revenue grows. Margin declines in GCS and USIS partially offset these increases.  For 3Q 2019, the effective tax rate used in calculating adjusted EPS was 21.2%, below the guidance we provided in July. The 3Q 2019 rate reflects discrete benefits in the quarter. The lower tax rate in the quarter benefited from a \u2013 benefited adjusted EPS by about $0.02 per share. We expect our 4Q 2019 and 2019 tax rate used for adjusted EPS to be over 23%.  In 3Q 2019, and year-to-date, operating cash flow of negative $165 million and positive $83 million were down $318 million and $424 million respectively from 2018. For both periods, these declines were more than driven by the following non-recurring items.  In 3Q 2019, Equifax made payments of $341 million against the $701 million accrual for the consumer settlement announced in the second quarter. No such payments were made in 2018. The timing of the remaining $316 million is subject to court approval and therefore uncertain, but not expected to be made until at least 1Q 2020.  Payments in 3Q 2019 and year-to-date related to the $57 million of restructuring charges taken in 4Q 2018 and 1Q 2019, were $7 million and $28 million respectively. In the first nine months of 2018, Equifax received $80 million of insurance proceeds, all in the first half, offsetting costs incurred to the cybersecurity incident. Equifax received no proceeds in 2019.  Capital spending or the incurred cost of capital projects in 3Q 2019 and year-to-date were $88 million and $286 million, down $14 million and $36 million respectively from 2018. We expect capital spending to be about $385 million for the full year in line with our July guidance. Due to the increased capital spending, depreciation, excluding acquisition of acquired intangibles is expected to be about a $190 million in 2019, up $35 million or about 23% from 2018.  As we look to 2020, depreciation will likely increase more on a percentage basis than in 2019. As we accelerate the movement of our systems to our new cloud infrastructure, cloud production cost will increase ahead of the savings from legacy system decommissioning. As we have discussed previously, cloud replaces owned assets and related depreciation. As we exit 2019, cloud production costs will be at a rate of approximately 5% of depreciation and we expect as a percent of depreciation this to increase significantly in 2020. Excluding payments related to settlements of litigation or regulatory actions, as we look forward, we expect full year free cash flow in 2019 to exceed $200 million.  Interest expense for the quarter was $28 million, and is expected to exceed $30 million in 4Q 2019 due to financing of the $341 million of consumer settlement payments made today.  Now turning to our guidance. For 4Q '19 we expect revenue to be between $885 million to $900 million, up 7.5% to 9.5% in constant currency. Mortgage inquiries are expected to be over 20% and FX is expected to negatively impact revenue by about 1.5%. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.47 and $1.52 per share.  FX is expected to impact adjusted EPS negatively by $0.02 per share and lower tax benefits in 4Q '19 are expected to negatively impact adjusted EPS versus 4Q \u201918 by about $0.03 per share. 4Q '19 revenue and adjusted EPS are benefiting from the much stronger mortgage market.  We expect a number of items to partially offset the expected stronger mortgage results including, certain trends impacting revenue and operating income in 3Q \u201919 will continue in 4Q, specifically in international, principally continued weakness in the UK and Australia and in GCS, the impact of recent settlements swelling GCS revenue growth. We will also see some increased cost in 4Q from both, first, our accelerating progress in the tech transformation will have the near-term impact of increasing both depreciation and cloud production costs and second, the continuation of customer-focused investments principally in Workforce Solutions and USIS.  EBITDA margins in 4q \u201919, despite these cost headwinds, are expected to exceed 35%, up about 200 basis points from 4q \u201918 and up a 100 basis points sequentially. For 2019, based on our 4q \u201919 guidance, our adjusted revenue guidance of between $3.507 billion and $3.522 billion is at the top-end of our previous range. Our adjusted EPS guidance range of $5.55 to $5.60 per share is at the low-end of our prior guidance.  The impact of FX is a negative $75 million to adjusted revenue and $0.15 per share to adjusted EPS and $10 million and $0.02 per share respectively more negative and at the time we provided guidance in July. Both our updated adjusted revenue and EPS guidance are consistent with the commentary we provided in July. This guidance reflects U.S. mortgage inquiries up about 7% year-to-year.  And with that operator, please open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead. Manav Patnaik : Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. My first question was just in the USIS non-mortgage piece, you talked about the sequential improvement, but you also said it was weaker than what you expected. So, just wanted to see if you could give us some more color on which area is it fell short of your expectations? Mark Begor : As you saw, we did very well, I think, in terms of improving the growth of our non-mortgage. And generally speaking, it wasn\u2019t any specific area. We had just expected we\u2019d see slightly better improvement, a little bit higher than the 3% growth that we saw. So we felt we would call that out. John Gamble : And then, Manav, We are pleased with the performance. We are pleased with sequential growth. I think we\u2019ve been pretty clear with you and others that that was our expectation. We feel very strong commercial momentum with USIS and we may have had an internal bar that was a little bit higher. But we are very pleased with the performance. Manav Patnaik : Got it. And then, just on the tax front, it clearly sounds like you guys have made a lot of progress, it sounds like you have a lot more visibility into it. So, I guess, could you just remind this again on the kind of savings, cost savings that you\u2019ve talked about before? And if there is any update on timing and how we should be thinking about that? John Gamble : Yes, no change in what we\u2019ve talked about the last couple quarters on the benefits we expect from the tech transformation. And as you know, we expect that to come in a couple of different vectors. One is, we expect it to enhance our competitiveness in the marketplace. Our ability to rollout new products.  The stability benefits to deliver the speed and the example that I shared earlier of our ability now to deliver real-time streaming of alerts and inquiries is something that wasn\u2019t possible before. So those are the benefits that should come from the top-line. We are starting to see some of those as we rollout new products.  On the cost side, we\u2019ve talked about a 15 or so percent benefit in our tech cost from a runrate standpoint and that comes, as you know from the benefits from a simpler and new cloud-based infrastructure and the one that\u2019s consolidating a lot of desperate systems. There is no change in our outlook for that. As we talked previously, both the revenue and the savings will start to feather in as we move forward and I talked about in my comments, five legacy datacenters coming off so far in 2019. Those are cost benefits and of course we got duplicate costs in some cases. In a lot of cases now we\u2019re running duplicate exchanges on legacy and in the cloud. And that will continue in 2020 and as we prepare 2020 guidance, we\u2019ll reflect that in the guidance. But on a runrate basis, when we complete the tech transformation, we expect to get those kind of savings.  And then, the third leg on this, as we talked about is the cash conversion through \u2013 it should improve through lower development costs going forward which we expect, still expect in that kind of 20% to 25% range that will allow us to have a more efficient technology infrastructure and allow us to have more cash for acquisitions for an M&A work, as well as our dividend and stock buyback when we decide to make the decision on that. Manav Patnaik : Got it. Thank you guys. John Gamble : Thanks, Manav. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Toni Kaplan : Thank you. Good morning. On the employer services business, is growth has been a little bit slow and a little below your expectations this quarter. Can you remind us of these synergies you get from having that business under the Equifax umbrella? And would you ever consider pruning it from the portfolio or do you like the diversification it provides just given the work around unemployment claims and things like that? Thank you. John Gamble : Yes, no. The answer is a clear no, that we view it as integral to the value proposition that Workforce Solutions delivers to companies and employers around the United States and then in other markets that we are going into. And it really provides a full suite of capabilities to the HR organization in our partnered companies and we believe that it\u2019s quite integral and during strong economic times, there is less unemployment.  So there is some pressure on that business. In other economic times when the economy is slower, we see benefits from the unemployment, but it\u2019s really integral to the value proposition that we provide to our partners and it allows us to provide real services to the HR teams and our contributors. And then also of course, get the contributed data records from them that is a part of our verification business. Toni Kaplan : It\u2019s great. And then, you mentioned that USIS product launches were double in 2019 from 2018 and I know we don\u2019t know the size of the particular products. But should we think of that as implying, maybe a double new business level in 2020 from 2019? Or how should we think about the NPI product level as well in 2020? And if I could just sneak this in, John, you said that, 3Q exceeded expectations pretty substantially, why not raise the guidance then? Thank you. Mark Begor : I\u2019ll leave that one to John and I\u2019ll pick the first one, Toni. On the new products, as you know, that\u2019s a real engine for growth for us and for the industry and we\u2019ve had a pretty good track record and a real muscle around NPI doing in the neighborhood of 60 NPIs in 2017 and 2018. And as we telegraphed here, three months ago, when we had our second quarter earnings call, we talked about being flat year-over-year on NPI launches in 2019 and one of the areas that we made some discretionary investments in to lean into in the second half of 2019 is around NPIs which is why we\u2019ve increased the number that we are planning to rollout by about 10 new NPI launches.  And part of that is coming from USIS. When you think about USIS in 2018, they were really focused on winning back the confidence and trust of our customers and that was less focus on NPIs and now that they are returning to a more of a normal operating and commercial mode, they are really focusing on that. And as you know, USIS is one of our larger businesses in market.  So, the team under Sid Singh is just putting more of a focus on NPIs which will definitely benefit in the future. There is no question that\u2019s an engine for growth for the company and for USIS. So, we\u2019d expect that to be another positive lever for them as they go into the fourth quarter and into 2020 and beyond.  I wouldn\u2019t attribute that to a doubling of their growth rate or any aspect of that. It\u2019s just another lever for them in the marketplace with more new products to sell to their customers along with the products that they\u2019ve currently got in the marketplace. John Gamble : Yes, just on NPIs, as you know, just remember that the bulk of the revenue from new products we accounted over three years tends to occur in the second half of year two and year three. Right, so in the first year, that doesn\u2019t tend to be that much revenue from a new product. Mark Begor : And then maybe just adding one more point on that, we did make a delivery decision in the second half of this year to put some more resources behind NPI because, we saw the ability inside of our financial structure to kind of lean in to more future growth.  And so, we look at this as an investment as John pointed out in the future that we probably de minimus benefits in the fourth quarter from those kind of investments. But these are the benefits that are going to be bearing fruit in 2020 and 2021 and beyond. John Gamble : And in terms of your question around our guidance and the forecast we provided, so again, I think we provided a lot of context in our prepared remarks. I think right now, if you take a look at our fourth quarter, we think it\u2019s really, it would be a very strong quarter for us. Very nice revenue growth. Margins up over 35%, up 200 basis points.  It\u2019s a big improvement despite the fact that we are seeing these increased costs, increased depreciation, increased cloud costs, as well as some of the investments Mark making. So, I think we feel good about what we provided. Also, if you take a look sequentially, what the third quarter to fourth quarter now looks like, it looks like a very \u2013 much more normal seasonal pattern, which again gives us confidence as we look through the rest of the year. Toni Kaplan : Thanks a lot. Helpful. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Thanks. Hey, first off, best wishes to Trevor, a speedy recovery. I wanted to talk a little bit about the $20 million charge. Is that just kind of one-time? Or is there any potential we could see that again? I know, maybe just given the size of it, or is it type of thing that if occurs it\u2019s just not only not this size? John Gamble : Yes, we view this as a one-time, which is why we\u2019ve accounted for net fashion. You always have commercial issues and commercial disputes generally, there is not of this size and is with two customers and we opted to have the kind of resolution that we did at the right solution for us and for our customers going forward and we do view it as a one-time. Kevin McVeigh : Got it. And then, the boost to the new products, the 70 from the 60 I think it was, there is a margin impact on that. Was it just the ability of maybe taking some of the over performance from the Q3 to drive some incremental revenue or just was it more an opportunity to maybe capture some incremental share in USIS? Mark Begor : Well, the increase in new products was a delivery decision. I think John highlighted a number of areas where, like any business, we make trade-offs about where we are going to invest and how much and as we\u2019ve gotten into the second half of the year, and we see some visibility of USIS continuing its move back to what I would call, more of a more normal commercial mode. And obviously, we had a bit of tailwind from the mortgage market. We make decisions around the future and NPIs are one. We are also investing in the second half some more commercial resources and beat on the street. John talked about accelerating some of our tech investments, moving some of our exchanges to the cloud, a little bit quicker perhaps than we anticipated.  And we also highlighted that whether it\u2019s new data assets that we are adding like Urjanet or some of the Twin additions. We looked at as being investments that are good for the future. Those are a real benefits that aren\u2019t going to as much help us in the near-term.  But, more going forward and then, we also had a couple of large customer wins that have some cost associated with this, which again is good news and in the umbrella, and on top of that we were pleased with the top-line growth either with or without the mortgage tailwind and then, the mortgage that the margin enhancement that we had and the margin momentum we expect going into the fourth quarter. There was the ability to make these kind of investments for the future which we think is smart. Kevin McVeigh : Super. Congrats again. Mark Begor : Thanks. Operator : Our next question will come from Greg Mihalos with Cowen. Please go ahead. Greg Mihalos : Hey guys. Good morning and let me also add my best wishes to Trevor for a speedy recovery. Mark Begor : Thanks. Greg Mihalos : Wanted to start-off in USIS. Mark, if we look at the performance in FMS and I understand that it\u2019s been choppy. But it definitely feels like there is more momentum there. When do you think you will kind of get to the point where you feel you will be able to have more confidence and in that pipeline conversion? Is that a quarter away, two quarters away? Any way you can kind of think about that part of the market. Mark Begor : It\u2019s a great question and we think a lot about it and we\u2019ve been pretty transparent with you and others as we talk about it. When you think about USIS and where they were a year ago, as you know, a year ago, we were still in security freeze with a lot of our customers and we are now pick your day, three quarters in of kind of a normal mode with customers and as we talked about in prior discussions, the rebuilding of our pipelines takes time.  We are very pleased with the rebuilding of the deal pipelines, but those pipelines are not mature meaning that they are built up over, call it a nine to 12 months timeframe from where we were kind of in the summer of 2018 following the cybersecurity breach. So, that\u2019s the element of uncertainty that John and I and the senior leadership team still have and FMS is a great example inside of USIS where we\u2019ve had very good result this quarter. Little less than we thought in the second quarter, but little better than we thought in the first, but it\u2019s choppy. And how many more quarters? I think it\u2019s a great question. We were deliberate about talking about that we still see some choppiness in USIS recovery.  But directionally, quite positive and it\u2019s certainly from our perspective getting into fourth quarter and first quarter, only being three quarters in to what I would characterize kind of a recovery in normal commercial mode. We need a couple more quarters to kind of see that with some more clarity. Greg Mihalos : Okay. Thanks for the color. And just as a follow-up, I think you mentioned that some mortgage-related NPI was pushed out given how strong the volumes were. I am assuming that now would be more of a driver for 2020. Is there any way to kind of quantify that for us? And then, on the margin front for USIS, were there any sort of one-time cost there that might not recur as we think about the fourth quarter? Mark Begor : Yes, in the first one, the mortgage discussions, as you might imagine, our customers right now, with this kind of mortgage inquiry growth they are flat out and we\u2019ve got, like others, probably in our space, we\u2019ve got a number of NPIs that we\u2019ve either been working on or we are working with those mortgage customers and those had to go on hold. We suspect that there won\u2019t be lot of activity in the fourth quarter either as inquiries continue to be quite strong meaning they are really focused on operating their businesses versus adding some of the new features and ideas that we have.  So, we are going to keep working on that. But my expectation is that those will probably be some deferral of that activity into early 2020 when things perhaps calm down on the mortgage originations side. John, do you want to touch the margin one on USIS? John Gamble : Sure. Look, on the cost \u2013 was your question specific to USIS or Equifax broadly? Mark Begor : I think it was USIS. Greg Mihalos : USIS. John Gamble : Yes, so, again, USIS is, I think, Mark mentioned right, we did have an uptick in development spend, right? And a focus on development spend in other areas and overall, that is occurring and as we mentioned in the script, right, royalties are higher. And that\u2019s also impacting margins. But, in terms of one-time, I wouldn\u2019t call them one-time. I\u2019d say our \u2013 the uptick in development spend is something that we intend to continue, perhaps not at quite this level. But we intend to continue going forward and we continue to invest in the commercial teams there. Operator : And caller, does that answer your question? Greg Mihalos : It does. Operator : We will take our next question from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Gary Bisbee : Hi guys. Good morning. Mark Begor : Good morning. Gary Bisbee : I wanted to dig in a little bit more into the concept of duplicate technology cost beginning to emerge as you are paying for usage on the cloud, but you still got the legacy tech cost. First, I just wanted to, John, clarify your comment, when you said, $190 million of depreciation, 5% as you exit the year. So you are talking $9 million or $10 million of cost in 2019. Is that right? And that number grows as a percent of a higher depreciation number significantly next year. Was that what you are trying to say? John Gamble : That was about it. It\u2019s a runrate. I must saying it\u2019s for the whole year of 2019 with the runrate exiting at that level. Yes. Gary Bisbee : Runrate? Okay, all right. That\u2019s what I wanted to confirm. And then just, how \u2013 is there any color I realize depends on migrations and lot of factors, but how we should think about the growth of that duplicate costs or the growth of the cloud cost relative to the fall-off? Are there any big step functions down as you retire legacy things in the next 12 months? Or just any other color to think about that and maybe it\u2019s most\u2026 go ahead. John Gamble : Yes, Gary, as you know that the step functions come when we unplug one of our datacenters and we\u2019ve gone from three unplugged up to five this year. That\u2019s going to continue in 2020 and our plan is to give you some visibility of that when we share guidance on 2020 in the next couple of months and we\u2019ll include the duplicate cost we expect to incur in there and as well as the benefits that we expect to incur as we decommission our legacy datacenters. Mark Begor : We also referenced in the script, right, that we moved an exchange, an identity exchange we said to the cloud and that that would be decommissioned in the first quarter. So, decommissioning one quarter out after a migration is quite fast. But generally speaking, we\u2019d expect to see that the decommissionings would occur probably for a very large exchange hopefully within plus or minus a year, right?  So, I think what you are going to see is slowly ramping cloud costs as volume moves to the cloud. The nice thing about cloud, right, is that, as you move volume, the cost increase slowly. So you will see slow increases in cloud cost as we move volume from a large exchange and then you will actually see us as we bring down portions of the infrastructure, bring down those costs related to the legacy. So, I know it\u2019s not a complete answer for you, but unfortunately, you are going to have to wait until we give guidance. So we can lay out to you in a little more detail how these cost ramp in and move down.  But I think in general, what you are looking at is, slow ramps for new systems as they board to the cloud and then decommissioning of those older systems and therefore those cost reduction is probably somewhere between one quarter which will be very fast and then on the order of a year for something which is very large. Okay?  For the very large systems, they don\u2019t all come down in one big lump, right? They do come down in pieces as portions of the infrastructure can be taken down. John Gamble : Hey, Gary, it\u2019s not lost on us that we got work to provide some visibility around this transformation. And our thinking is to enhance that visibility and how we are sharing kind of the old versus new with you as we get into 2020. So, that\u2019s on our to do list as we prepare our guidance for next year and how we will talk about the company in 2020 as this becomes increasingly meaningful part of our cost structure. Gary Bisbee : Great. Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up. You mentioned higher royalty expense. I think you mentioned that in other quarter earlier this year. Things like the Urjanet partnership, revenue sharing with payroll providers to get their files and the work numbers.  Should we think of that strategy and those types of things as having sort of a meaningful or noticeable impact on the margin dynamic of the business looking forward? Or is that really just the timing of a couple of things along with all the other moving parts you are dealing with is why you\u2019ve called it out recently? Thank you. John Gamble : Sure. We called it out specifically in USIS because, some royalties from specific providers that we work with frequently went up in 2019. And so, it was a specific cost in USIS. But in general, you are going to see royalty cost continue to go up and they will probably go up as a percentage of revenue but not dramatically. Mark Begor : Yes, it won\u2019t have a dramatic impact on our business. It\u2019s a \u2013 as you know, we own most of our data assets. We will continue to own most of our data assets. But increasingly we see real value in the incremental revenue and incremental margins we get through some of these relationships which as you point out, we will share some margin with them in a royalty scheme. But it\u2019s \u2013 for a long, long time, it\u2019s hard to even envision it\u2019s going to be a de minimus element in the business. Gary Bisbee : Great. Thank you. Operator : Moving next, we will got to Jeff Meuler with Baird. Please go ahead. Jeff Meuler : Yes. Thank you. Maybe, Mark, some more details on Ignite be on your comments and that in the prepared remarks, but I guess, the bigger question is, competitors have made a lot of inroads with clients with trended data beyond mortgage in over the last two years it seems like they have made some inroads with their advanced analytics platforms, as well. Just it seems to me like that might position them better for clients for core credit file business as well as cross-sell generally. But I would love your reaction to that view and maybe if you could kind of talk about the Ignite process or progress in that context. Thanks. Mark Begor : Sure. Jeff, and you raise a great point. We believe that the decisioning systems in our case, Ignite are really critical capability and really an important element to have with our customers and that\u2019s why we are investing so heavily in Ignite and also our integrated Ignite InterConnect platform, because we believe that today, Ignite has a market-leading capability embedded in Ignite as things like our patented NDTAI technology.  And we are having really good traction in the United States and around the globe of rolling out Ignite and embedding it with our customers. We believe we have a very competitive product and it\u2019s one that we are continuing to invest in to advance our lead and the capabilities that we have. I was with a customer yesterday actually here in Atlanta who is looking at doing an Ignite installation with us.  They don\u2019t have any of our competitors\u2019 products in their decisioning tool. And they are very attracted to what the Ignite capability will deliver. But it\u2019s really quite strategic to us and important to us. Jeff Meuler : Okay. And then, the Twin records add just quickly, was that a large employer? Or was that some new partnership that\u2019s coming onboard? Mark Begor : It\u2019s a combination of the two. It\u2019s one, we are \u2013 we had a large partnership that we added in the quarter and then we also continue to add a large individual employer. So it\u2019s a dual strategy as you know and the partnership strategy is one that we\u2019ve put more focus on in the last couple of years.  But core to our strategy is going out the individual companies and we are obviously getting real scale there in that business which is driving hit rates with the non-farm payroll at a 165 million. There is still a long road for the EWS team to continue to add records which will be one of many levers to drive their top-line. Jeff Meuler : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Bill Warmington : Good morning everyone. So I was going to ask for an update on the partnerships with FICO. How the pipeline is? Any deals closed? And we noted that you are \u2013 that you guys are going to be presenting at FICO World in a couple of weeks. Mark Begor : Thanks, Bill. Yes, I neglected to talk about that this morning, probably should have \u2013 we were \u2013 we had our quarterly joint session with Will and his team. Will Lansing and his team at actually at FICO a couple of weeks ago. We\u2019ve got great momentum on our combined cloud data decisions product that combines our Ignite, our data assets and their DMS platform and then we\u2019ve got a number of other products rolling.  We\u2019ve actually had our first customer win. We are \u2013 it\u2019s not \u2013 you wouldn\u2019t talk about one customer win, but again, that\u2019s momentum in that relationship and it\u2019s \u2013 the partnership that we are energized about and Will and I will be at FICO World. We are going to jointly give some updates on some of the newer new products that we are working on together.  We continue to see more opportunities to a partner and we are energized about that. And just shifting from FICO, you would add Urjanet and others we are working on. I think you \u2013 I hope you see it. In Equifax that\u2019s looking for ways to not only own things and acquire them like PayNet, but also to look for strategic relationships like FICO, like Urjanet and others where we can take advantage of Equifax\u2019s assets with someone else\u2019s and bring real value not only to us, but also to that partner. So, good progress with FICO Bill. Bill Warmington : The follow-up question for you. On the myEquifax product, you mentioned 2 million customers or 2 million consumers, I just wanted to ask what\u2019s the critical mass you need to get to, to begin doing the cross-selling? And when should we start to think about seeing some revenue contribution from that? Mark Begor : Yes, it\u2019s a great question. So, first off, getting from zero in December of 2018 to 2 million, we feel pretty good about and we are adding them \u2013 I don\u2019t know, 15,000 to 20,000 a week. They continue to come in. So there is a lot of consumer positives about having that relationship with Equifax and you know the team\u2019s plans in GCS are to begin some of that cross-sell effort as we are doing some pilots in the fourth quarter and that will continue into 2020 and really go into production mode in the first half of 2020.  And we just view this as another lever for GCS in their direct business to deliver products to our customers and expand the kind of products that we offer to U.S. consumers. Bill Warmington : Okay. Well, thanks a lot and a shot out to Trevor to get well soon. Mark Begor : Thanks, Bill. Operator : Moving next, we\u2019ll go to Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.. Please go ahead. Andrew Steinerman : Hi, Mark. A comment on your prepared remarks is, do you expect USIS to return to historic growth rates? This is the first time I remember you saying that we are going to get to historic organic revenue growth rates. Do you think Equifax is now at a point where you could comment about the medium-term algorithm, the previous 6% to 8% organic revenue growth and maybe make a comment about current USIS visibility because that was one of the things you wanted to think about when we are introducing the organic. Mark Begor : Yes, thanks, Andrew. I guess, from my perspective, I\u2019ve been consistent since I joined April 18 months ago that it was my view and it\u2019s shared by the team here. It\u2019s not a matter of if, it was only when, not only USIS, but of course, Equifax, because of the impact the USIS has in the overall enterprise would return to its historic growth rates.  I try to be consistent on that. There wasn\u2019t a new comment on my part today or wasn\u2019t intended to be one. I\u2019ve been quite consistent about that. And as you also point out, we\u2019ve also discussed that USIS is recovery, our confidence in that recovery, our confidence in that path back to the historic growth rates was one of the factors that John and I and the leadership team are watching for before we put a financial framework back in place and we are still in that mode.  As I mentioned a couple of minutes ago is one of the other sellside analysts were, from my perspective we\u2019re only three quarters in. You could pick how many quarters we are into USIS showing what they can and will do. 2018, they were in more defense mode. We are clearly back in offense and third quarter was a positive step forward.  We expect fourth quarter to also be a positive step forward. It\u2019s still hard for us to handicap how many more quarters we need before we are going to have the confidence that they are on the path back to their historic growth rates.  But my comments from a year ago April and what I try to be consistent since then is it\u2019s not a matter of if, it\u2019s only when and that\u2019s really driven by the differentiated data assets that the business has, the role it\u2019s had in the marketplace. It\u2019s driven by the new team we have which is really energizing and it\u2019s also driven by the technology investments that we are making. We believe that this is going to take not only USIS, but Equifax to another level. Andrew Steinerman : Thanks, Mark. Appreciate it. Mark Begor : Thanks, Andrew. Operator : Our next question will come from Brett Huff with Stephens. Please go ahead. Brett Huff : Good morning, Mark and John. Mark Begor : Good morning. Brett Huff : Two questions. One, just to dig down a little bit into the USIS. I want to make sure that I am getting the comparisons right. I think that the 3% sort of ex-mortgage inorganic compares to a 1% last quarter. And so, it\u2019s a nice acceleration. Is that the right way to think about that? Mark Begor : It\u2019s up over 200 basis points, yes. Brett Huff : Okay, great. And just digging down in that a little bit, obviously you had great strength both in the online and in the FMS and I know FMS kind of goes up and down and furthermore project-driven. So, I wanted to dig in and see that 200 basis points acceleration.  How did that kind of shake out in terms of \u2013 was it more of the online stuff, which I think we think of as more kind of sustainable or long-term versus the FMS. Just want to understand kind of how you guys thought about that sort of quality if you will in that acceleration? Mark Begor : Yes, I don\u2019t think we broke down that detail between both, but what we did is we saw growth obviously in both. So, I mean, and that was very important to us and continuing to be able to continue to see that that growth rate improve across those business both online and batch.  It\u2019s important to us, but in the third quarter we certainly saw online non-mortgage growth as well. And as you point out, Brett, that\u2019s very important as is FMS. Our project or our financial marketing business is also important. But we see positives in really all corners of USIS as they continue to march forward. Brett Huff : Thanks. And just the follow-up is, it was really helpful John, when you talked about sort of the chunky things that can happen with expense benefits from decommissioning big databases and exchanges. Is there a way to give us, are there five big ones and ten small ones and how many are we done with? And have we decommissioned already?  Can you give us just rough kind of macro view on that, so we can \u2013 as we start to try and phase in the cost savings of the deduplification, if you will? Can you just give us any thoughts on how to think about that? John Gamble : So, we certainly will, but I think we are going to have to ask you to wait until we give guidance for next year, right. And I think, and as we get to that point, a lot of transitions will be well underway and our timing will be very specific. We will be able to give you a lot better detail on what that might look like. Mark Begor : And Brett, let me add to that. Look, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, we know we have to give you more visibility on that than we plan to. Part of us waiting to do it as a part of our 2020 guidance is that\u2019s when the rubber is really going to hit the road, meaning, we are going to have a lot of these migrations and a lot more moving to the cloud and we\u2019ll have more with the duplicate cost.  Our intention is to make sure that that\u2019s crystal clear for you both n when the benefits should be kicking in as well as when the costs are being incurred. And we also are learning as we go and getting more knowledge about how quickly customers will move and how these migrations will take place. John Gamble : And we\u2019ll try to cover broadly how margins will move. So we had earlier questions on royalties. We\u2019ll discuss how they are growing as a percent of revenue to Brett, get people detail on how to think about those things. Brett Huff : Great. Fair enough. Thanks for the detail guys. I appreciate it. Operator : Moving next to Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Please go ahead. Andrew Nicholas : Hi, good morning. I believe you mentioned a comment about the press around the settlement news impacting your Consumer segment a bit more than you had expected in the quarter. I am just wondering if that pressure has abated at all thus far in Q4 and if not, how long would you expect that to be a headwind. Mark Begor : Yes, it was a small headwind, Andrew, and we actually made a proactive decision. We thought there would be more consumer noise, if you will, around the settlement that would result in our paid search efforts being less affected. So we made a decision around that timeframe to dial back our paid search, which of course when you do that results in acquiring less customers. And we since started that up quite quickly, because it really didn\u2019t had the impact we anticipated. So we just wanted to spike out that there was a small bump from that. It wasn\u2019t significant, but it was, it did had an impact on GCS. Andrew Nicholas : Got it. Thank you. And then, one more from me, obviously Verification growth was really strong. 29% is a great number. I know mortgage was a tailwind and you talked a little bit about partnerships. But just wondering if there is anything else to call out on the strengths and maybe a little bit of guidance or little bit of color on how we should be thinking about growth rates on a go-forward basis? John Gamble : Yes, so I think in the script, we basically indicated every segment grew very nicely. Right, so Mark listed the segments that grew very, very well. We had\u2026 Mark Begor : Let me add to record growth. Andrew, as you might imagine growing records is a really important lever for that business. It drives hit rates immediately assumes the records at our database and of course, the record growth is another lever there that benefited strongly in the third quarter. We expect that to benefit going into fourth and in the future. John Gamble : You should keep in mind, 29% for Verification Services is a very high number, right. So, expecting things to continue like that is probably a little high. But they had very good performance and we expect very good performance in the fourth quarter. Andrew Nicholas : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Togut : Thank you. As you look to the major macro drivers of USIS, mortgage, auto, credit cards, what are your thoughts about the sustainability of current trends, at least at a macro level into 2020, especially if 10 year treasury yields stays as low as it is, 1.7%, 1.8%? Mark Begor : Yes, this is outside of our skill sets. I can give you our perspectives. When you think about kind of the macros, it\u2019s hard for us to predict interest rates, but the mortgage activity in the last 90 days, we expect to stay strong in the fourth quarter. It\u2019s hard to forecast going into 2020, we will do that as we get closer. Outside of mortgage, which obviously has had a big bump with interest rates coming down and mortgage rates coming down.  The core consumer finance market is very strong. Whether it\u2019s credit cards or auto, that\u2019s still very strong. You\u2019ve got a number of macros in there that are helpful. Interest rates, as you point out are one, employment and unemployment being lower another one, people are working. They got discretionary income. Those are all quite positive.  So, our discussions with our customers, they are still focused on growth in originations. There is also a dialogue I talked about in the last quarter of getting ready for when that slowdown comes and so we are having dialogues around kind of back book management and some of the great tools that we have to help with that. But we are expecting the economy to be kind of where it is now going into 2020.  We don\u2019t see anything different. It\u2019s hard to forecast with some of the political uncertainty here and around the globe how that\u2019s going to impact with the core consumer is quite strong. David Togut : Appreciate that. Just as a sort of a follow-up on macro, Australia was such a strong growth market for Equifax for a while, post the Veda acquisition. I am just curious what your view is on the credit market in Australia? When you think that might turn and to the extent it doesn\u2019t, are there any actions you intend to take there just from a pure cost management standpoint? Mark Begor : Yes, on the market, there was a slowdown in Australia started in the third quarter last year. We felt we saw some signs of positive after the election in the second quarter. That hasn\u2019t flowed through as much as we thought. But as we pointed out in our comments earlier, we are starting to see some online volume in both consumer and commercial that\u2019s more positive in the third than it was in the second.  So, we are watching that. Actions we are taking, we did some cost actions in the first half of the year. We think we got the cost right-sized. Most importantly, we got a new leader there. One of our best international leaders who was running our Canadian business, Lisa Nelson, is on the ground there.  There she started in late August and she took Canada from a slow growth business into the kind of high-single-digits and we\u2019ve got great confidence in her leadership capabilities and her focus on customers and NPIs and growth. So, that was a deliberate step on our part to put a new leader on the ground there and she is one of our best. So we are optimistic about that. David Togut : Thank you. Appreciate all the insights. Mark Begor : Thanks. Operator : And we will take our next question from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead sir. George Tong : Hi, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to dive deeper into your tech savings. You mentioned 15% in expected savings in the technology portion of cost of goods sold and 20% to 25% savings in development capital and expense. Can you quantify how much of cost of goods sold is technology spend? And talk about how much of the development savings will be CapEx versus OpEx? Mark Begor : Go ahead, John. John Gamble : Yes, so, on to the technology portion of COGS, we said it\u2019s on the order of half to slightly below half, right? So, that\u2019s generally what we\u2019ve indicated. And in terms of development expense and capital, it\u2019s really difficult to split those for you specifically.  So, I think we are going to have to hold off and we\u2019ll give you some more perspective on that as we get into 2020. But in general, what we are saying is the spending we are making on new products and new development should go down by 25%. The bulk of it is capital. But the exact split is not something we are going to \u2013 what we can break out right now. George Tong : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Your EBITDA margins expanded for the first time in two years this quarter. Would you see that going forward, we should continue to see margin expansion and what are the two or three factors that could potentially cause EBITDA margins to return to contraction? John Gamble : Well, so, in terms of fourth quarter, we guided we expected to see EBITDA margins to go up over 35%, which would be a substantial increase from 2018, right. So that\u2019s up on the order of 200 basis points. So, again, I think what\u2019s driving the improvement in margins is the return to growth of the business and the improvements we are seeing obviously in USIS, the tremendous performance in Workforce Solutions and which is driving their margins higher.  But then also, we are seeing some improved margins in international, much of that driven by cost actions as well as some return to growth. So, what we are focused on is how do we continue to drive those margins higher and that\u2019s what we are going to be spending our time. Mark Begor : And George, I would add, I think you know this, we talked a couple times this morning already about it. You and I talked in prior sessions that technology investments we are making are all focused on driving our top-line and our cost structure. You already talked about the operating cost benefits we have. So, those are all going to be positive to our margins in the future, which is why are making these investments. George Tong : Very helpful. Thank you. Mark Begor : Thanks. Operator : And we will take our next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead. Caller, please check your mute function. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Can you hear me now? Mark Begor : Yes, we got you. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. Sorry. The last time the company went through a big change in interest rates as mortgages. The company split out the mortgage-related growth versus the non-mortgage related growth and given that we are trying to track the company as a whole and how the growth is doing, are you able to do on a total company basis, just saying, hey, if I strip out mortgage over the last couple of quarters or three, this has been the growth of the business, so that we can just kind of get a beat at what\u2019s going on really ex the mortgage business and where we track that? John Gamble : So, Shlomo, we try to do that in the individual businesses, so, in the commentary today we tried to lay out what the growth, what the non-mortgage growth rates look like in USIS. What they look like in EWS. In terms of supplemental reporting, yes, I don\u2019t think we are headed in that direction, but we are trying to provide some visibility in terms of the impact of the mortgage market changes had us. For example, we gave the total dollar value impact of the growth in the mortgage market versus our expectations, right, which we said was about $25 million. So\u2026 John Gamble : When we talk about USIS and EWS, both with and without the mortgage impact. Shlomo Rosenbaum : So, if I \u2013 I am just saying, like if I took out mortgage, would I say growth as a whole company was more like 5%, like is that the right way to look at it up from 2% or 3%? What\u2019s the right way to look at it? John Gamble : Understand the question, we don\u2019t at this time have an intention to go back to try to create separate reporting publicly for mortgage and non-mortgage. So, I think we provided some pretty good detail in terms to understand the impact of the mortgage market on the major businesses. But \u2013 and I think that\u2019s probably the exam we are going to go through now. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. And then, Mark, can you just talk a little bit more about what\u2019s going on in the UK? Your major competitor that also has a business in the UK that posted double-digit organic growth despite what\u2019s going on with Brexit. Is there a mix issue going on over there? Is there a market shift issue going on over there? Is it you don\u2019t compete in the same areas. Can you just give us a little background on that? Mark Begor : Yes, their business \u2013 and again, I don\u2019t spend a lot of time on their business. I just focus on mine. But we saw their numbers and as you probably know, they operate in some different markets that we do. We\u2019ve got the debt management business, they don\u2019t. We both compete in the core credit business. They\u2019ve got a consumer business that\u2019s different than ours.  So, yes, there are different businesses there. I don\u2019t know enough about their financial results. But I know about mine. I was there two weeks ago meeting with some big customers and there is no question what we are seeing is big customers delaying new product kind of decisions around Brexit uncertainty. That started in the second quarter and continued into the third and from what I saw two weeks ago, it\u2019s going to be here in the fourth.  That\u2019s just a reality. There is no change in competitive. We are not winning less and losing more or anything like that. It\u2019s just that decisions around new products and as you know, that\u2019s one of the fuels for growth in our business and it\u2019s not only in the UK and other markets. So, it\u2019s nothing more than that from my perspective. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. Great. And then, if I could just squeeze in one last one. Are you \u2013 do you have any tangible areas where you\u2019ve made small migrations and you are really seeing new product developments where you are able to get something out really quickly? I mean, are there \u2013 is there anything where you have something in hand where you are able to say, yes, we\u2019ve made this and now we\u2019ve come across some stuff if anybody will do in a much accelerated pace. Mark Begor : Well, I spiked out intentionally, one that, we moved our U.S. credit file to the new Google Cloud data fabric in the quarter. And during the quarter, we rolled out a new product that we couldn\u2019t do before and our competitors, from what we understand can\u2019t do today of a virtual streaming of information from that data exchange and you know the speed of the data historically was done in overnight runs or every three hours or with certain limitations and how quickly it could be delivered out of the file is now done in hundreds of thousands of data records every second.  So, it\u2019s just the velocity and the latency of that is something that we anticipated. And what we found is that there is a customer demand for that and as I said in the call, we\u2019ve got a customer live with this new product from the cloud exchange that couldn\u2019t have been done before.  And this is one customer and we\u2019ve got a pipeline for this one new product of delivering virtually streaming alerts and inquiries and data to the customer that there is a pipeline of a handful of other customers who want to do the same thing.  So, that\u2019s a one example of what we think will be a whole bunch more, which is as you know, one of the reasons we are making this significant investments in our technology, because we think it\u2019s going to make us differentiated in the marketplace. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : And this does conclude today\u2019s question and answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to John Gamble for any additional or closing remarks. John Gamble : That\u2019s it. Thanks everyone for participating and we look forward to speaking with you during the quarter. Operator : And this does conclude today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day and welcome to the Equifax Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded and at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to John Gamble. Please go ahead, sir. John Gamble : Thanks and good morning, welcome to today\u2019s conference call. I\u2019m John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. With me today is Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com. During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements including full year 2020 guidance to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC including our 2018 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. Also, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. For the fourth quarter of 2019, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes accruals were legal matters related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident, costs associated with acquisition-related amortization expense, the income tax effect of stock awards recognized upon vesting or settlement and foreign currency losses from remeasuring the Argentinean peso-denominated net monetary assets. Adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax also includes legal and professional fees related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident, principally fees related to our outstanding litigation and government investigations, as well as the incremental non-recurring project cost designed to enhance our technology and data security. This includes projects to implement systems and processes to enhance our technology and data security infrastructure, as well as projects to replace and substantially consolidate our global networks and systems, as well as the cost to manage these projects. These projects that will transform our technology infrastructure and further enhance our data security were incurred throughout 2018 and 2019 and are expected to occur in 2020 and 2021. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to Equifax adding back interest expense, net of interest income, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization and also as is the case for adjusted EPS, excluding accruals for legal matters related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident, cost related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident and foreign currency losses from remeasuring the Argentinean peso-denominated net monetary assets. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our website. I would also like to welcome back Jeff Dodge who\u2019ll be rejoining us for the next several months until Trevor Burns returns from his medical leave. Mark and I would like to thank Jeff for stepping back in, it is greatly appreciated and Jeff has joined us today. Now I\u2019d like to turn it over to, Mark. Mark Begor : Thanks, John and good morning everyone. If you\u2019ve been following the news this week it was another busy week here at Equifax. Before I get into the fourth quarter financial results let me just spend a few minutes on Monday, the Department of Justice and FBI announcement on their indictment of four Chinese military officials for their role in the 2017 cyber-attack on Equifax. We\u2019re pleased that the FBI and DOJ were successful in identifying the criminals who attacked Equifax and US consumers. Monday\u2019s announcement is another positive step forward for Equifax as we closed the chapter on the 2017 event. Continuing on the 2017 cyber event, you recalled we took $700 million charge in the first half of 2019 related to the comprehensive settlement of the most significant legal and regulatory matters facing Equifax. In the fourth quarter, we recorded an additional charge of $100 million related to resolution of all remaining US legal proceedings and investigations arising from the 2017 cybersecurity incident. This charge includes settlement [indiscernible] in the securities class action and the shareholder derivative litigation. The financial institutions class action and law suits by states of Indiana and Massachusetts who did not join last year\u2019s multi-state Attorney General Settlement. The charge also includes an estimate to resolve the remaining open US proceedings and investigations. This charge is net of insurance proceeds related to these matters. The matters for which no estimate is included in this charge are the resolution of the review being undertaking by the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK and the Canadian Consumer Class Action Litigation. Consistent with prior legal settlement charges related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident, the $100 million net charge is excluded from our fourth quarter 2019 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. In January the court granted final approval for the multi-district consumer class action settlement we entered into 2019. The timing of when the remaining approximately $360 million of the consumer restitution fund will be paid depends on the resolution of the appeals filed related to this case. The timing of that resolution of the appeals is still uncertain. Details on the status of all outstanding legal and regulatory issues we provided in our 10-K to be filed later this month. Monday\u2019s indictment by the Department of Justice and our resolution of the US matters related to 2017 cyber event allows our team to fully turn the page and focus on our EFX 2020 Security and Technology transformation and growth that Equifax is a leading data analytics and technology company. Let me move now to our fourth quarter results. We\u2019re very pleased with our financial performance in the fourth quarter and strong progress in 2019. The results were broad based showed sequential improvement, were above guidance and we\u2019re another very positive step forward to Equifax. These results are our strongest since the 2017 event and reflect Equifax return to a more normal growth more. Revenue at $906 million was up 10% in constant currency and up 8% on an organic constant currency basis and above the top end of our October guidance. We had strong revenue growth driven by our two US B2B business USIS and EWS. They collectively grew up a strong 13% overall with workforce solutions up a strong 22% and USIS up a very solid 8%. The 22% growth at EWS was strongest since 2016 and USIS\u2019s second half performance was their strongest since 2015. US mortgage market inquiries remain strong with inquiries up just under 21% and consistent with our guidance. International delivered 4% constant currency revenue growth with growth in all regions in the quarter, but with continued pressure from the slowdown in Australia, Brexit uncertainty in the UK and most recently the unrest in Chile. Global consumer continued their path back to growth with revenue up almost 3.5% and as I expected, improving revenue growth driven by the recovery of our US consumer business. Adjusted EPS of $1.53 per share was at a top end of our guidance, we provided in October. The adjusted EBITDA margin of 35.2% grew nicely up 200 basis points compared to 2018. While we\u2019re seeing increased depreciation and duplicate cloud cost as our transformed systems move into production. These costs were in line with our guidance provided in October. Let me move now to the individual business units. First, USIS; their revenue was up 8% versus the fourth quarter of 2018 on a reported basis and 5% on an organic basis. Total mortgage revenue was up just over 20% consistent with the growth of the mortgage market inquiries. Mortgage solutions revenue was up 19% in the quarter much stronger than prior quarters in 2019 as we left the negative impact of the mixed shift from a large mortgage reseller which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our non-mortgage revenue growth grew 3% in the quarter and non-mortgage organic growth was positive again, but up only slightly compared to last year. This was lower than the third quarter and lower than our expectation and reflects the continued choppiness of the USIS recovery that we\u2019ve discussed over the past two years. We saw continuation in some very positive trends in USIS and feel good about accelerating USIS non-mortgage organic growth in 2020. Online revenue in USIS was up 7.5% on a reported basis and up 4.5% on an organic basis. We saw double-digit growth in mortgage, ID and fraud, insurance and data x [ph], as well as in auto and banking in London. These are all very important verticals for USIS. This growth was principally offset by declines in our telco segment and our direct to consumer segment. Direct to consumer is the segment in which USIS sells credit files in scores to other credit reporting agencies. This was down due to one-time sale that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2018 that did not repeat. We expect this segment to return to growth in the first quarter of 2020 and while telco saw a decline in the quarter, we\u2019ve very good success with recent customer wins and win backs and expect \u2013 and see a clear line of sight to growth in telco as we move into 2020. Financial marketing services revenue was up 3.5% in the quarter compared to last year. For full year 2019 FMS delivered 2.5% revenue growth as compared to 2018. While quarterly FMS revenue was still choppy. They delivered growth in three of the four quarters in 2019 which we view as positive. The revenue growth reflects the continuing growing pipeline that we discussed over the past couple quarters in that business. Sid Singh and the USIS team continue to show accelerating commercial activity through 2019 with good momentum coming out of the fourth quarter and into 2020. Their new deal pipeline is up 15% at year end 2019 versus year end 2018 and new deals won in 2019 increased over 2018 by almost 25% and in the fourth quarter the dollar value of new deals won with the highest it\u2019s been in the past four years. We continue to believe that our differentiated data assets coupled with our technology investments will return USIS to its traditional growth mode. The fourth quarter and 2019 results show that they\u2019re well down at half. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins of 45.1% were down 240 basis points from fourth quarter 2018 primarily due to increased royalty cost as well as higher development expense and investments in data analytics, commercial resources and new product resources. Shifting now to Workforce Solutions, they had a very strong quarter with revenue up 22% compared to last year which was much better than our expectations. Verification services revenue was up and extremely strong 33% driven by broad based strong double-digit growth across mortgage, healthcare, debt management, auto, government and talent solution verticals. The strong and broad based verification services revenue growth reflects continued growth in work number active records as well as the rollout of new products, expansion into new verticals and addition of new customers. EWS and verification services revenue growth excluding the benefit of the mortgage market were up a strong 12% and 19% respectively. Rudy Ploder and the EWS team did an outstanding job in 2019 growth their business and expanding the Twin database. Twin has almost 105 million active records at the end of 2019 and over 82 million active unique individuals up 15% from a year ago. These compared to the roughly 170 million including self-employed individuals in the US non-form payroll which gives us plenty of room to grow our database in the future. As you know these Twin records really drive our revenue hit rates for our customers and benefits to US consumers. Our system to system integrations with our customers allow us to monetize additions to the twin database as soon as they\u2019re added by delivering the higher hit rates to our customers as they access our database and their system to system applications. Employer services declined in the quarter 6% and in line with our expectations primarily due to the expected declines that workforce analytics, our ACA business as well as our unemployment claims business. The strong verifier revenue growth resulted in strong adjusted EBITDA margins of 47%. Margins were lower in the quarter compared to the prior year principally due to incremental third-party implementation and royalty cost associated with the Twin records expansion and some higher selling cost. Workforce Solutions is clearly Equifax\u2019s best business and they continue to deliver strong results with significant future growth potential. Shifting now to international, their revenue was up 4% in local currency and almost flat on a reported basis. And this was weaker than our expectations. The majority of the weakness versus our expectations was in Latin America particularly in Chile and to a less degree in the UK debt management business. Importantly, we saw a better than expected performance in Asia Pacific including Australia. I\u2019m encouraged about the trajectory of the international business given the revenue growth posted in the second half of 2019 despite the continuing economic headwinds in Australia, Chile and the UK. Asia Pacific which is primarily our Australian and New Zealand businesses was up almost 1% in local currency in the fourth quarter versus fourth quarter 2018 and 1.5% for the second half of 2019. Importantly in Australia, we saw our consumer and commercial online revenue which combined represents just under half of Australian revenue growth about 5% in the quarter. We also saw a nice growth in our identity and fraud business and our HR solutions business. We continue to see weakness in our marketing services business which we expect to continue, but at a lesser extent through the first half of 2020. I was in Australia two weeks ago with our new leader Lisa Nelson, she and her team are focused on returning the business to growth in 2020. We expect local currency Australia revenue growth to return to growth in the first quarter and strengthen in the second half of 2020. The Australian business continues to make very good progress with positive data and by the end of the fourth quarter we had 80% of positive data from contributors including 90% of the credit card and mortgage data for Australia. We expect this additional data to be a new lever for growth for the business in the future. Shifting now to our European businesses which were up 1% local currency in the fourth quarter and weaker than our expectations primarily in our debt management business. Importantly, our European credit business was up 5% in local currency and improvement from the up 1% in the third quarter of 2019 and their strongest performance in 2019. Consumer online and batch which represents almost 60% of our European CRA revenue was up 3% in the fourth quarter. Our Analytics and Scores [ph] business and Ignite InterConnect revenue grew double digits in the quarter and this growth was driven by strength in Fintech and financial services. Commercial and ID fraud revenue was weak in the quarter. Our European debt management business declined 7% in local currency to principally in Spain and our debt management business with the UK government did return to growth in the fourth quarter which was positive. However we expect the overall debt management business to remain weak through the first quarter of 2020 at as the Brexit situation normalizes. Shifting to our Latin American business, they grew a strong 10% in local currency in the fourth quarter of 2019 despite the impact of Chile due to the recent unrest. We saw double-digit constant currency growth in Argentina, Ecuador, Uruguay, El Salvador and Mexico. And we\u2019re seeing growth accelerate as our Latin American businesses benefit from the expansion of Ignite and InterConnect SaaS customer rollouts and strong NPI rollouts in 2018 and 2019. Canada was up strong 9% in local currency in the fourth quarter and 8% for the full year reflecting a continued focus on customer renovation and new products. Canada continues to be a very strong growth market for Equifax. International adjusted EBITDA margins at 36.4% were up 400 basis points compared to the prior year. The strong recovery in margin reflects both the return to growth in the quarter and the benefit of the cost actions we implemented in the fourth quarter of 2018 and during 2019 as well as improved income from minority investments. Shifting now to Global Consumer Solutions revenue, that business was up 3.5% on a reported and constant currency basis in the fourth quarter, a substantial improvement from the 50 basis point increase in the third quarter of 2019. Global consumer direct revenue which represents just under half of our total GCS revenue was down only 1% in the quarter. Double-digit across the UK and Canada\u2019s combined consumer direct businesses was offset by an 8% decline in US consumer. Although a slightly greater decline in the US than we\u2019ve expected it still represents a substantial improvement in the double-digit decline in US consumer direct we saw in the third quarter and earlier in 2019. Our GCS partner business increased 6% in the quarter as a result of solid growth with our US partners, our benefits channel and our Canadian breach [ph] business. Our GCS partner team continues to close new logos and their pipeline has grown nicely from this time last year. GCS adjusted EBITDA margins of 26.9% increased 580 basis points compared to the prior year and increased 200 basis points sequentially in the third quarter of 2019. As expected in the fourth quarter, we saw the effective revenue growth and the benefit of cost actions taken earlier in 2019. The GCS team has done an excellent job turning this business around and returning it to growth. Dann Adams our leader of GCS retired from Equifax in late 2019 after 21-year career at Equifax. I want to personally thank Dann for all his contributions to Equifax including his President of USIS, EWS and GCS during his career. Dann leaves a tremendous legacy and will be missed. Taking over for Dann is Bev Anderson who joined us after more than 30 years of experience in financial services. Bev joins us from Wells Fargo where she was most recently responsible for leading the growth and transformation of their consumer credit card business and operations. I\u2019m really excited to have Bev join, my leadership team and to lead the GCS business. Turning now to our technology transformation. In the fourth quarter, we reached some significant milestones in our $1.25 billion EFX 2020 Security and Technology transformation. As you recall, we launched a three-year program in 2018 to migrate our data and applications to the Google Cloud. We made significant progress on the implementation of our US data exchanges and the new cloud-based data fabric [ph] during 2019 and we have some real momentum as we move into 2020. As of today, initial migrations of the work number and CTUE, auto, Target Connect and our IXI Wealth Exchange in cloud-native environments are complete. We expect to begin delivering in production to customers from these migrated exchanges as early as March. With complete migration of all data ingestion processes and legacy system decommissioning completed over the next six to 12 months. By the end of second quarter in 2020, we expect to have completed initial migration of our US commercial exchanges, property exchange and our data x exchange and by third quarter of 2020 initial migration of all US exchanges including our property exchange, US consumer or ACRO exchange are both scheduled to be completed. These data migrations to the cloud are meaningful milestones in our technology transformation program. Our Ignite Analytics and Machine Learning platform that includes Attribute and model management capability is integrated with InterConnect will be fully available for our customer migrations at EWS by the end of the first quarter and at GCP by the end of the second quarter 2020. This will include the ability for customers to easily ingest and manage their own data as well as Equifax data in their own Ignite instance. We continue to make strong progress globally and rolling out our Ignite Analytics platform with over 150 customers now using Ignite Direct and Marketplace. NDT, our patent explainable machine learning technology has now been deployed in the Ignite development with over 30 customer models. And a few weeks ago, we rewarded our second US patent for NDT. We\u2019re also making progress internationally with our cloud transformation. The initial migration of the Canadian Consumer Risk Exchange and known fraud exchange to GCP and EWS will occur by the end of the second quarter of 2020, with similar progress in the UK and Australia and New Zealand and consumer exchange is expected by year end. We\u2019re also seeing accelerating progress in the migration of our customers onto our cloud-based InterConnect and Ignite API framework. This is the common set of services on which we\u2019re working to migrate all USIS, EWS and International customers. By the end of the first quarter of 2020, we expect to have migrated approximately 1,000 US customers with similar amounts in International. This pace will accelerate significantly through 2020 with a vast majority of US customer migrations completed by early 2021. As we\u2019ve discussed customer migrations as certainly the most challenging part of our technology transformation to forecast. But we\u2019re very pleased with customer\u2019s enthusiasm for the benefits of our new cloud-native environment and the accelerating pace of customer migrations. I hope this gives you a sense of the significant progress we\u2019re making in our technology transformation that will deliver industry leading cloud-native technology to our customers. We are laser focused on execution and have continued good momentum as we move into 2020. Shifting now to new products, this remained a key component of our EFX 2020 strategy and a long-term muscle for Equifax. We have an active pipeline of innovation and new products and we\u2019ve launched over 90 new products in 2019 up 50% from 2018 and up from the guidance we gave you in October. As you well know, innovation and new products fuel our growth and are integral to our strategy. Importantly, USIS product launches were up two times in 2019 and are back to the level that we were seeing in 2016. EWS also had a very strong new product year doubling their new product launches. Innovation and product rollouts will get increasing focus from our team in 2020 and 2021 as we leverage the unique benefits of our cloud-native data fabric and cloud-based applications to deliver capabilities and new capabilities to our customers. It is a key lever for Equifax growth in the future. In 2019, USIS launched new or enhanced products in marketing including enhanced email append data x pre-screen and pre-approval of one. And identity and fraud including new Luminate fraud product suite and Synthetic ID 2.0 and in several vertical specific products in commercial which allow our customers to take advantage of our broad and commercial lease payment dataset with the acquisition of PayNet in real estate for lead scoring, a new inside score for personal loans and for the insurance industry new score, the Inflection Score which we developed jointly with Verisk. EWS also expanded their product offerings through the addition of new data assets including education, property and other data to augment their unique income and appointment data which is part of their path towards being a data hog that centers around their income and employment data asset. EWS\u2019s new product included expanded mortgage product offerings as well as new talent reports to be rolled out to support identification of loan stacking for the personal loan industry. International also had a strong year with new products increasing launches over 30%, with good distribution across all of our geographies. The strength in international NPIs is driven by over 100 customer Ignite installations at our international customers. As you can see, we really prioritized our focus and resources on driving innovation and NPI rollouts in 2019 and we plan to invest even further in innovation and new products in 2020 and beyond. NPI has continue to be an increasingly important lever for Equifax growth particularly as we levered to the new product opportunities in front of us from the cloud transformation. We also recently announced new partnership with rent reporting platforms including the Esusu, MoCaFi and Zingo to help develop a more complete picture of our consumers financial profile from rental data. These rent reporting platforms enable customers to often to include rental payment data as a part of their credit report to allow more complete picture of their financial history. All three companies as part of their credit education initiatives will also present their users with a free weekly or monthly vantage score, so consumers can track score changes over time. We believe these partnerships are a win for consumers and a new data source for Equifax. And earlier this month, we completed the acquisition of the remaining interest in our India business to take 100% control of that business. We view India as a strategic long-term market with tremendous potential with our unique data assets and capabilities. Wrapping up and looking back at 2019, we made tremendous progress in executing against our EFX 2020 strategy. We\u2019re convinced we\u2019ll return Equifax to market leadership and growth as a leading data analytics and technology company. We have strong operational momentum coming out of 2019 with revenue growth in the second half of 2019 at almost double the pace of our first half performance. This second half acceleration particularly in our US businesses as well as return to year-over-year growth in EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS positions us well for 2020 and beyond. Monday\u2019s announcement of the DOJ indictment along with our resolution of the principal remaining legal issues related to the cyber event is another very positive step forward for Equifax that allows us to close the chapter on the 2017 event and turn our focus fully towards the future growth of Equifax. Our $1.25 billion EFX 2020 cloud-native transformation has accelerating momentum and we\u2019re now implementing in production major exchanges as well as our Ignite Analytical environment in our cloud-native infrastructure. We are also actively migrating customers onto our cloud-based InterConnect Ignite API based platform and we\u2019re equally energized about all the learning [ph] [indiscernible] power of the new cloud-native environment to drive innovation, speed the market, new products and solutions, always on stability and the cost and cash savings we\u2019ve talked about previously. We remain convinced that our cloud investment will be transformational for Equifax and drive our top and bottom line in the future. We continued our focus in 2019 on advancing our already differentiated data assets by adding significant new data capabilities in the US through our PayNet acquisition and in our partnerships with FICO, Yodlee and Urjanet. This focus on expanding our data assets will continue in 2020 and beyond. We continue to make big investments in our data security to deliver on our goal of being an industry leader in data security. In last, we have the right team in place for the future of Equifax. Over the last two years we brought in strong talent to my leadership team and the broader business. We\u2019re all aligned on returning Equifax to growth and market leadership. We\u2019re energized by all we accomplished in 2019 the momentum and the business as we move into first quarter in 2020. We know we have a lot of work still in front of us, but our focus is clear around executing our $1.25 billion cloud technology transformation while driving new innovation and products that will accelerate our growth in the future. With that, let me turn it over to John. John Gamble : Thanks Mark. I\u2019ll generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis, but we\u2019ll refer to non-GAAP results as well. In the fourth quarter, total non-recurring or one-time cost related to the cybersecurity incident and our transformation excluding the $100 million in legal accruals that Mark discussed were $82 million and below our expectations principally due to lower legal fees. The cost includes $76 million of technology and security and $6 million for legal and investigative fees. For all of 2019, US mortgage market inquiries were up over 6.5% versus 2018 which is in line with what we had expected in October for 2019 inquiries. 4Q, 2019 inquiries were up almost 21% consistent with what we had expected in October. In the fourth quarter mortgage related revenue represented just over 19% of Equifax revenue. As a reminder, the estimate we provide is for 2020 mortgage market credit inquiries. We base our estimate on multiple third-party forecast of mortgage originations in dollars including MBA, Fannie and Freddie. Our current forecast originations of about flat in 2020. As we believe only slightly more positive on the order 50 basis points than the current MBA originations forecast of down 7%. Inquiries can be very meaningfully from originations principally due to mortgage tight mix and timing of inquiry versus closed lines. In the fourth quarter general corporate expense was $211 million excluding non-recurring cost adjusted general corporate expense for the quarter was $72 million down $4 million from 4Q, 2018. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.2% in 4Q, 2019 up 200 basis points from 4Q, 2018 and up 130 basis points from 3Q, 2019. As we discussed in October and as covered in Mark\u2019s comments the increase in overall adjusted EBITDA margins year-to-year is driven by positive mix as high margin USIS and EWS at the highest revenue growth rate in 4Q, 2019. Growth in margins and international and GCS as well as leverage on corporate cost as revenue grows. Margin declines in USIS and EWS from strategic investments partially offset these increases. The 4Q, 2019 the effective tax rate used in calculating adjusted EPS was 22.7% slightly below the approximately 23% we have provided for guidance for our 4Q, 2019 in October. We expect our 2020 effective tax rate to be about 24%. Full year operating cash flow of positive $314 million was down, $358 million from 2018. The decline was more than driven by the following non-recurring items; Equifax made payments of $341 million in 3Q, 2019 for the consumer settlement announced in the second quarter, no such payments were made in 2018. And payments related to the $57 million of restructuring charges taken in 4Q, 2018 and 1Q, 2019 were $36 million. Capital spending or the incurred cost of capital projects in 4Q 2019 and year-to-date was $90 million and $376 million, down $28 million and up $8 million respectively from 2018. Excluding payments related to settlements of litigation or regulatory actions full year 2019 free cash flow was above $250 million and was better than our expectations. Now let\u2019s take a look at 2020. 2020 is an important turning point for Equifax 2020 Security and Technology transformation as we accelerate the move of our data exchanges to data fabric at GCP. Our customer transitions to our Ignite InterConnect API framework and our identity and fraud customers transition to using our new systems at AWS. As we put our cloud-native systems into production we will begin to depreciate these new systems and incur the cloud and other operating cost of running these new cloud-native systems. It will generally take six to 12 months from the start of production to fully transition a legacy exchange or positioning system to a new cloud-native system. During that time period we will incur both the cloud and other operating cost of the new system as well as the operating cost of the legacy systems. As 2020 is a transition year and the decommissioning of the legacy systems is not expected to substantially occur until late 4Q, 2020 and 2021. We will incur these additional system transition cost for much of 2020. For 2020 we expect these additional system transition cost to be in the range of $0.40 to $0.50 per share. With increased depreciation representing about two-thirds of this additional cost and cloud cost net of any legacy system decommissioning savings representing approximately one-third of this cost. As we move into 2021, we expect the savings from the decommissioning of legacy systems to exceed the incremental cloud cost resulting in a net benefit to the P&L as opposed to the duplicate cost we will be incurring in 2020. As we have said in the past, when this transition is complete we expect to generate significant cost savings of 15% plus savings in technology cost portion of cost to goods sold and the technology portion of cost to goods sold represent just under 15% of our total COGS and the 25% reduction in our development spend both in expense and capital. And we expect our new single data fabric and cloud-based applications to accelerate innovation and new products that will be accretive to our growth rate. Now for 2020 guidance, we expect total revenue to be between $3.65 billion and $3.75 billion reflecting constant currency revenue growth of 4% to 7%. [Indiscernible] the US mortgage market will be about flat in 2020. FX will negatively impact revenue by almost 1% and adjusted EPS by about $0.03. USIS revenue is expected to be up mid-single digits in 2020. EWS revenue will continue to deliver double-digit revenue growth with very strong growth in verification services, employer services is expected to be flat to down. International revenue will grow mid-single digits with growth strengthening in the second half of 2020 due to expected economic improvement in Australia and Europe. GCS revenue will also grow mid-single digits in 2020 with continued growth in our partner business at ID Watchdog and in our UK and Canada Consumer Direct businesses. We expect US Consumer Direct to return to growth late in 2020. For 2020, we expect adjusted EPS to be $5.60 to $5.80 per share reflecting constant currency growth of approximately flat to 3.5% versus 2019. As I discussed earlier impacting adjusted EPS in 2020 is $0.40 to $0.50 per share of increased depreciation and additional system transition loss [ph]. This represents approximately eight percentage points of growth in adjusted EPS. As such excluding this tech transition impact adjusted EPS growth is 8% to 11% which helps give a clear picture of the post-Equifax 2020 earnings power of Equifax. Due to the substantial increase in depreciation, we will in 2020 add to our discussion with you more focus on adjusted EBITDA margins which we believe will better reflect the true earning power of Equifax. In 2020, adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to expand by approximately 50 to 100 basis points. This includes the drag of about 50 basis points from the additional system transition costs. Excluding this transition cost adjusted EBITDA margins would expand between 100 to 150 basis points in 2020. As we discussed the duplicate legacy and cloud cost will be in place during 2020 and 2021 as we migrate customers to the new cloud environments and decommission legacy mainframe and server environments. In 2020, we expect to incur approximately $255 million in non-recurring expenses comprised of $250 million in non-recurring security and technology transformation expenses and less than $5 million in legal and regulatory expenses. This does not include the cost of any potential judgments or other regulatory outcomes should they occur. In 2021, as we have stated previously, we will no longer exclude these non-recurring expenses from our adjusted EPS. Capital spending in 2020 is expected to be approximately $335 million. There are several important assumptions impacting 2020 in total as well as the individual quarters. US mortgage market inquiries for all of 2020 are expected to be flat, however 1Q, 2020 inquiries are expected to remain strong up over 21% year-to-year. 2Q, 2020 inquiries are expected to be about flat and we expect inquires to decline about 10% in each of the third and fourth quarters. 2020 corporate costs are expected to increase approximately $45 million versus 2019. Depreciation expense was in the corporate cost line is expected to increase over $15 million. 2020 corporate cost excluding depreciation are expected to increase year-over-year by about $30 million. The increases are principally and security and technology as well as equity compensation. The higher security and technology cost are partially a result of the system transitions in 2020 as we invest to ensure we maintain high levels of security in both the new cloud-native and legacy systems. As we decommission legacy systems at a more rapid pace beginning in late 2020, we would expect these security and technology cost to moderate. Over half of the 2020 total increase of $45 million in corporate costs will occur in 1Q, 2020. Interest expense is expected to increase about $13 million or $0.08 per share in 2020 reflecting the incremental borrowings to fund the legal settlement payments in 3Q, 2019 and 1Q, 2020. About two-thirds of this increase will occur in the first half of 2020. Note that our guidance does not reflect any incremental borrowings associated with approximately $355 million remaining in consumer legal settlements as the timing of that payment is still not known. Our 2020 tax rate is expected to be slightly higher than the 2019 tax rate at 24%. We continue to expect our normal seasonal pattern for recorded revenue and adjusted EPS with 1Q being the lowest and 3Q and 4Q being the highest in dollar terms. However in terms of year-over-year growth rates we\u2019ll expect 1Q to have the highest growth rates for revenue and adjusted EPS. For 1Q, 2020 we expect revenue in the range of $915 million to $930 million reflecting constant currency revenue growth of 9% to 11%. We are expecting adjusted EPS to be $1.29 to $1.34 per share. FX is expected to negatively impact revenue by over 1% in 1Q, 2020 and negatively impact adjusted EPS by $0.01 per share. Higher interest expense negatively impacted adjusted EPS by $0.03 per share versus 1Q, 2019. The tax rate in 1Q, 2020 is expected to be about 25%. And with that operator, please open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] and our first question will come from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Andrew Steinerman : I just wanted to understand how you\u2019re using the word mortgage inquiries like you know to be flat in 2020 as your team\u2019s expectation is that supposed to be a proxy for Equifax\u2019s revenue in 2020 for that part of the business which [indiscernible] about 19% and if so, 4% to 7% constant currency revenue growth would be kind of high single-digit non-mortgage revenue growth rate. John Gamble : The credit inquiries is exactly as it sounds, right. It\u2019s with each mortgage transaction we get an inquiry and we\u2019re simply trying to let you know, what we forecast those inquiries to be for the year and as I said, we estimate that based on the information we have in terms of the number of inquiries that we get per closed mortgage loan and then we use the forecast provided by MBA and Freddie and Fannie to do an overall originations forecast and then translate into credit inquiry. So it does reflect the inquiries reflect, it isn\u2019t necessarily a proxy for a revenue because obviously there\u2019s pricing changes in the year. We also get new records in workforce solutions so we get growth from that and we also launch new products in mortgage which drives our growth higher. Mark Begor : We also get some penetration with the mortgage customers when they\u2019re using our credit reports or the Twin records, two times, three times, four times in their mortgage process so that\u2019s another part of our revenue model. John Gamble : Absolutely. As you know historically, we send it to outperform the inquiry index. So it is to give you a view as to what we think the market is going to do in terms of the number of times market will request information for the credit bureaus. Andrew Steinerman : John, the second part was to do 4% to 7% constant currency revenue growth you\u2019re assuming that 19% of your revenue is headwind, so you would have to do the kind of high single-digit constant currency revenue growth in the non-mortgage segment right? John Gamble : So certainly our guidance indicates that non-mortgage is going to be higher. Right? It\u2019s going to do kind of \u2013 now again but you have to keep in mind we\u2019ll outperform that EWS for example as they continue to grow records. We\u2019ll certainly outperform in the mortgage segment, the revenue they generate versus that inquiry index. So you can\u2019t just use the credit inquiries or the proxy directly for revenue because certainly we do perform differently than that in certain circumstances. Andrew Steinerman : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Kevin McVeigh : John, if I heard you right it seems like degraded [ph] back the depreciation, the EPS would be $6 to $6.20, that\u2019s a lot better than where the Street is on revenue that\u2019s pretty much inline. Is that the mix in EWS or where else is that leverage coming through in the model? John Gamble : Can you ask the question one more time, I didn\u2019t fully follow? I\u2019m sorry. Kevin McVeigh : Yes, so. It looks like there\u2019s \u2013 the depreciation if I heard you right it was kind of $0.40 to $0.50 headwind that deflected of depreciation which would imply $6 to $6.20 versus or your guidance would be $6 to $6.20 versus the Street at $5.80, that\u2019s a lot better than kind of where the Street is, the adjusted EPS versus kind of where the revenue guidance is relative to the Street, is that just the mix that\u2019s driving at and I guess I\u2019m assuming there\u2019s some margin outperformance there. Is that margin outperformance in workforce solutions or am I just not thinking about that right? John Gamble : So what we indicated it was $0.40 to $0.50 per share for both the increase in depreciation and the duplicate costs we\u2019re occurring because we\u2019re running both cloud systems and our legacy systems until those legacy systems are decommissioned. So that is 40% to 50% and yes, we did say that\u2019s about eight points of growth in the year. So relative to where the Street was, I can\u2019t specifically address that. But I can indicate that, we did in the third quarter pretty specific guidance as to how much we thought our depreciation would go up, right? So I think there was a pretty good understanding generally prior to the fourth quarter beginning following our third quarter earnings call that we were going to see significantly increased depreciation in 2020 and we\u2019re also going to see significant increases in cloud cost in 2020. So I think that information was broadly out there before. Kevin McVeigh : It\u2019s helpful. And then just with the indictments does that open the potential that maybe you can recover some of those cost driven [indiscernible] writing the incumbent insurance or does that not change the outcome in terms of what you\u2019ve already incurred? Mark Begor : I think we fully taken advantage of our insurance coverage there as far as any recovery. So our expectation is, that the charges that we took last year and the charges we took in the fourth quarter will be Equifax [indiscernible]. The number we\u2019ve shared with you are net of insurance. Kevin McVeigh : Super. Thank you. Operator : Next question will come from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Manav Patnaik : Mark, over the course of the year, you\u2019ve talked a lot about how the pipeline is been improving in product and all the progress you\u2019ve made. But at the same time I think in the few quarters where you said the ex-mortgage USIS is being short of your expectations. So I was just curios, if you could maybe help us bridge that gap and maybe what is your expectation for USIS mortgage for 2020? Mark Begor : Yes, I think that John talked about we expect that USIS overall to be in mid-single digits. With regards to expectations, we\u2019ve got a high bar here, that\u2019s how I operate. I think that\u2019s Manav, you know that we want that business to return to its historical growth rate. It\u2019s making great progress. I think you know a year ago when we were on this call with fourth quarter, 2018 that business was in the flat to negative mode and was just getting out of the penalty box with their customers and we\u2019re now four quarters or so into that recovery. We\u2019re making great progress as far as their pipeline is building, their win rates and we see some really positive momentum as we move into 2020. We expect that business to continue to improve as we go through the year and expect it to return to its historical growth rate, it\u2019s just a matter of time. It\u2019s still one that the non-mortgage growth. There\u2019s a lot of variables there as far as pipelines being rebuilt and the timing of closing deals that we\u2019ve talked about. Virtually every quarter that since the cybersecurity incident that we\u2019re just seeing deeper pipelines, better win rates which gives us confidence as we go into 2020. John Gamble : I just want to make sure, to Andrew\u2019s initial question. Just to make sure, I was clear, right so Equifax has historically performed better than the mortgage index in terms of our revenue. So again as you\u2019re doing your analysis on the implications of our mortgage market guidance in terms of its implication to our non-mortgage revenue growth. You need to please recognize and take a look at history of the fact that we\u2019ve generally significantly outperformed the mortgage index in terms of our own mortgage revenue growth. Manav Patnaik : Got it. John, just two clarifications on the guidance. So one, can you just \u2013 is there any M&A baked into it whether that\u2019s India or any of the other [indiscernible] from this prior year and then I lost you a little bit on the $0.40 to $0.50 of the incurring which year and how that the savings that you said was one-third of the [indiscernible], so can you please just help me with that in 2021? John Gamble : The only thing we include in our guidance is acquisitions that have actually closed. So there\u2019ll be no new acquisitions included. In terms of the \u2013 I think you\u2019re asking about the $0.40 to $0.50 per share in system transition cost. Manav Patnaik : Yes. John Gamble : That $0.40 to $0.50 per share is made up of two things. We said about two thirds of it is incremental depreciation rate, so we\u2019ve been investing heavily over the past several years, building new production systems, cloud-native production systems in the cloud. And as they go into production obviously, we start to depreciate them. So off that, $0.40 to $0.50 we said about two thirds of it will be substantial increase in depreciation in 2020 versus 2019. And then about, one-third of the incremental cost is related to duplicate costs in operations because we\u2019re running cloud systems as well as our legacy systems in parallel for an extended period of time while we migrate customers. So we\u2019re incurring effectively double cost, the cost of the existing legacy premise system as well as the cost of the cloud system during the transition period and we said, that transition cost in the period of running of two sets of systems would be about one-third of that $0.40 to $0.50 per share. And the final comment I made is, on that specific cost the duplicate cost of running two sets of systems. We had said, as we move into 2021 as we move through the year, we expect that to actually become a positive, where the savings related to shutting down legacy systems will exceed cloud costs and that will start to become a positive for the company. Mark Begor : And Manav just to add to that, Mark. I think as you know a lot of our investors have asked for some transparency around that because number one, on the second point John raised in the duplicate cloud cost as you know those aren\u2019t going to be here forever and those are going to start, as we decommission system they\u2019ll turn into being a positive, there\u2019ll be some of that in 2020 that\u2019s in our guidance now and the numbers John talked about and that will accelerate in 2021 and we\u2019ll get to fully migrated basis sometime in the future and we\u2019ll give you guidance on that. So that was that element. And then on the accrete amortization same thing, that\u2019s the temporary element if you will, it will [indiscernible] shall be there for a number of years of that increased amortization which is a non-cash item and that\u2019s going to work its way down as we amortize our investments in the cloud cost. As you know our intention is to reduce our CapEx spending in 2021 as we complete the cloud migration. So our intention is to be clear about our guidance which John gave you, but also give the additional visibility of what\u2019s inside that guidance so you can be aware and think about what Equifax looks like on the other side. Manav Patnaik : And just what will be M&A contribution, John. I know you [indiscernible] deal because all in that in 2020? John Gamble : It\u2019s relatively small. Right if you think about, we closed PayNet and I think in the second quarter of 2019 and that was the largest acquisition for the years. In the fourth quarter we gave some indication the total amount of acquisition revenue was just over 1% of revenue so not a significant number and it should decline as you move through 2020. Manav Patnaik : All right, thank you guys. Operator : Next question will come from Georgios Milhalos with Cowen. Q \u2013 Allison Jordan : This is Allison on for George, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up on the comments made about Workforce Solutions margins in the quarter. I think I heard that the year-over-year decline was driven by third-party implementation royalty cost. I\u2019m just curious is there anything else to call out there maybe mix and how we should think about segment margins going forward in 2020? Mark Begor : Yes, I also mentioned Allison that there was some additional sales cost in the fourth quarter and that business which put some pressure on margins. I think John also said that we expect that business to expand margins in 2020 and we don\u2019t see any change in that, but high growth in their inherent margins that\u2019s a business that we expect expanding margins going forward. John Gamble : And just to make sure you were clear; the royalty costs are actually separate from the third-party implementation cost. Right? So those are two different cost items that affected us in the quarter as well as obviously increased sales expense. Q \u2013 Allison Jordan : Okay, great. Thank you. That\u2019s super helpful. And then just one quick follow-up, Mark I heard you mentioned the solid progress being made of positive data in Australia. I\u2019m curious that we should expect any impact from this in 2020? Mark Begor : Yes, we hope it will be accretive as we go through the year. We\u2019ve seen in all the markets where positive data comes in, it obviously first takes a lot of time to get that data from the contributors into Equifax and the other credit bureaus and then turning that into usable information that we can take to the marketplace as a lag to it. The good news is, we have the data now which we\u2019ve been working to get there so we expect it will be, a positive element for that team in 2020. Q \u2013 Allison Jordan : Great, thanks very much. Operator : Next question will come from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Q \u2013 Hamzah Mazari : My first question is just, if you could just talk about how long your sales cycle today is on new products currently and maybe how much they\u2019re contributing to growth today versus sort of pre-breach, just to give us a sense? John Gamble : So sales cycle it really depends on the product, so if it\u2019s a batch product something that we\u2019ve sold historically that effectively reselling it\u2019s something that can sometimes be initiated and transacted within a period. For implementing a new online service for the customer the implementation period can be over a year and it really depends on the service. In terms of NPI contribution and new product contribution in 2019 versus prior years. I think what we try to be clear on is the level of acceleration we\u2019re seeing in new products launches which we think is very beneficial as we go forward into 2020 and 2021. Obviously the level of new product revenue we generated in 2019 and 2018 was certainly down from what we saw historically because of the fact that we didn\u2019t have the same level of product generation over the 2017, 2018 period so that was \u2013 so we\u2019re seeing a period of lower new product revenue generation, but we see very good signs that will start to recover as we move into 2020 and then certainly 2021. Mark Begor : You heard my comments, just to add on that. New products and innovations is a real priority. And it\u2019s one that obviously we had some pressures on following the cybersecurity incident with all our focus on security or mediation everything else and I\u2019m pleased that our efforts in 2019 to make this a priority central to Equifax\u2019s strategy. And you saw the performance of us rolling out, the highest new products in number of years in 2019 and that emphasis is going to continue. We really believe there are cloud transformation and having our single data fabric and having our products in the cloud is going to allow us to even accelerate that going forward and this is an area that we\u2019re going to continue to invest resources, time and money on because of the positive impact it will have in the future around our top line by investing in more new products. Q \u2013 Hamzah Mazari : Very helpful, just a follow-up question. I\u2019ll turn it over. Could you give us a sense of how much of your portfolio is sort of directly linked to the credit cycle versus how much of the portfolio is just data similar to sort of influence services company? Any sense of rough percentage of you know qualitatively any comments there? John Gamble : I think the best thing I can suggest is, if you take a look at the earnings that we published, we published obviously last quarter and there\u2019ll be one published today. In it, we show revenue by market segment for Equifax and for the each of the business units and it\u2019s probably the best place to take a look to \u2013 so you can judge based on where we sell and how you think that is impacted by the credit cycle, I think that\u2019s the best source for you. Mark Begor : I think the other thing that you should be aware of it, is you know our business and our industry during a credit cycle obviously expenditures by our customers on new originations may come down but the shift and focus to the back book through managing credit lines. So there\u2019s an element to counter cyclicality to it and then the other element it\u2019s quite different at Equifax today versus the last economic cycle is been mix of our businesses. We\u2019re obviously larger internationally than we were in the last economic cycle and then second, Workforce Solutions is very different scale in our business and size and Workforce Solutions has that additional lever in a credit cycle of the ability to continue to add new data records that are monetizable [ph] so that\u2019s another element of how we think about ourselves, if there\u2019s a credit cycle. We\u2019re very different in a positive way than we were in the last credit cycle. Q \u2013 Hamzah Mazari : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Q \u2013 Gary Bisbee : I was hoping to dig in a little bit more to the USIS growth organic ex-mortgage slowing from I guess it was three to slightly positive. Part of it clearly understand financial marketing and an outsized growth quarter last quarter and maybe a more normalized trend number. This quarter to that part of it and you called out a couple of the end market that were a little weaker. Can you give us any other color just to understand this and maybe, how we think about the cadence of that into Q1 that will be helpful? Thank you. John Gamble : I think in Mark\u2019s script where we talked specifically our Direct our D2C business which is the transactions we do with our competitors and part of the reason that was down obviously was because we had a sale that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2018 that was one-time, that didn\u2019t recur and that directly impacted the organic growth in the period. And then also we talked about telco [ph] and yes it was down, but we think we see very nice path to growth as we get into second quarter and beyond in 2020. So I think overall, we\u2019re expecting to see nice improvement in our level of organic, non-mortgage growth as we move into 2020 and beyond. So we do like the trend, right we said it, it would be chopping so that doesn\u2019t mean the trend is always straight up, but and we do like the trend. We do see continuing improvement that the sales metrics are very good, the level of growth of pipeline is outstanding and we are very happy with that performance. So I think that overall we\u2019re expecting to see nice improvement in 2020 relative to 2019 in total and certainly relative to where we ended the year. Q \u2013 Gary Bisbee : Thanks and then the follow-up. Just on the pipeline you preferred to improvement in growth, but in absolute terms is like the \u2013 is the pipeline back to where it was in mid-2017 are you still below that? And as part of that historically with NPI you guys talked about a three-year build to sort of mature revenues, 2017 and 2018 you had a lot less product development and NPI. New products as you were trying to fit some of the challenges. Is the fact that you had those product launches in 2019 should we think it\u2019s a three-year process to really get a lot of that stuff particularly in USIS? Getting the business back churning, the way one might expect if you want in normalized basis. Mark Begor : You\u2019ve hit a lot of the challenges that we\u2019ve had following the cyber event. First was \u2013 we had a pipeline in place the day before the cyber event happened and that pipeline went virtually to zero for the balance of 2017 and through the bulk of 2018. As you know we were on Security freeze for much of 2018 and as we finished 2018 and moved into 2019 we were able to start getting into a more commercial mode when customers grew quite comfortable about our security protocols and our investments and that pipeline has been building rapidly through 2019 and John I don\u2019t know, I believe it\u2019s actually back or above where it was pre-2017 and we\u2019ve seen real growth in that. We\u2019ve also got a different leader in the business who\u2019s got a real commercial cadence to him, there\u2019s real intensity around pulling that forward. I wouldn\u2019t think about a new product taking a full three years to get to revenue. I think we\u2019ve talked about before there\u2019s a maturity element in that but each of these products have a different cycle dependent upon the customer. you\u2019ve got a customer that the operations team or the marketing team or the risk team really likes the product and then they want to test it and then we go through a contracting process with their sourcing team many times in their course, then you go in the implementation mode which sometimes include their IT team and that could lead some unpredictability in a pipeline that maybe to your point is less mature meaning you don\u2019t two-year old deals in there, three-year old deals, one-year old, six months, you know you have to have that layering. Our pipeline today is more of call it a 12-month kind of build versus historical we have two and three-year kind of deals in there that sometimes take that amount of time. So I think that layering create some of the choppiness but the fact that the pipelines building we\u2019re seeing better win rates out of the pipeline, in the second half of the year, in the first half which tells us that we\u2019ve got a better pipeline in that commercial activity gives us the enthusiasm about the continued progress of USIS going forward as we get into first quarter in 2020. John Gamble : Mark specifically referenced new deals one in his script and that\u2019s higher than we saw prior to 2017. So we think the momentum is good. Q \u2013 Gary Bisbee : Thank you. Operator : Next question will come from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Q \u2013 Toni Kaplan : In an interview the other day Mark, you mentioned that you\u2019re about two-third to the way through the tech transformation and you mentioned some color earlier in terms of what you\u2019ve done and what you have left to do? I guess my question is, can you just give us some color on how much risk is left in terms of execution that have a lot of the difficult items been done already or is there still a lot to come and just any color on that would be helpful? Mark Begor : Yes, a talked a bunch of my comments earlier Toni about that and I think first off as you know, these kind of tech transformations are not for the faint of heart meaning that, you use the term risk. But there\u2019s a lot to do and a lot to work on. We\u2019re three years into it call it, whatever that kind of timeframe. And the milestones we\u2019re achieving around \u2013 when I think about a tech transformation like this and I\u2019ve done them before obviously not at this scale, but I\u2019ve done them before. First of all, you have to make sure does the technology work. Meaning, can we get out databases from our legacy applications into the cloud and I think, you know we\u2019re making a big move of going from siloed [ph] databases to a single data fabric. That\u2019s in place, we did that in 2019. We\u2019ve started moving our exchanges as you know we have \u2013 I don\u2019t know what the number is, but probably a couple hundred exchanges around the globe close to 50 here in the US. But we have some big ones and we are moving big ones into that new Google Cloud fabric and it\u2019s working. We have customers accessing it. So that\u2019s kind of risk number one, is will the technology work and I think we\u2019re over that hurdle. The second is, you got to migrate your customers. And we\u2019ve been very clear with you that the feedback from customers is extremely positive. If you think about it, if you\u2019re a customer do you want to do business with a company that has the very latest technology, it\u2019s going to deliver always on capabilities, it\u2019s going to deliver latency in speed that is not possible in the industry today and with security that\u2019s second to none, given the focus on data security. So customers all want to do it, the wild card there was one complexity I talked about in my comments earlier is getting into their schedule. Every one of our customers has an IT team. They got their own priorities for 2019, 2020 and 2021 and we just have to make sure we fit into that. So that\u2019s that scheduling or forecasting element that I talked about earlier. But as you also heard in the comment we\u2019re really rolling. Meaning we\u2019re moving thousands of customers and so there\u2019s real progress there but it just takes time and of course we need to move all our customers off each of our different mainframe or server environments, different data centers we have in order to decommission those and get the savings that we are looking for from the technology transformation. So to me it\u2019s\u2019 really around execution and you\u2019ve heard our transparency around the technology element and we feel very good about that and we\u2019re making real progress around the customer migrations, but there\u2019s still work to be done there. Q \u2013 Toni Kaplan : Great and then, with the legal settlement almost behind you pending the final payment. I guess any new thoughts around capital allocation notably like when we could start seeing share repurchases? Thanks. Mark Begor : I think you were leading me towards our financial framework which as you know we pulled in 2017. We\u2019ve been clear with you that we want to put that back in place. We\u2019re getting closer to that timeframe. We\u2019ve been very consistent. We\u2019ve talked about three areas that we wanted to make sure we had clarity on before we put that framework back in place which will include our capital allocation model. One was, real clarity in the legal settlements and with today\u2019s announcement of the finalization of the US issues. We\u2019re at that stage with that first item. Number two was the tech transformation. We already talked about that. Really having some clarity about timetable, our execution, our confidence in that and I\u2019d say every day and week we get closer to completing that one and number three is, USIS and we\u2019re way further along than we were a year ago and even in the fourth quarter with our confidence in USIS. So just a long winded answer, that it\u2019s our expectation that the way we are pacing, we\u2019re looking to put that framework back in place for sure in 2020. Q \u2013 Toni Kaplan : Thank you. Operator : Next question will come from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Q \u2013 Bill Warmington : A tip of the hat to, Jeff Dodge. It\u2019s one of those, just when I thought I was out, they pulled me back in situations, I think. So my question is, you gave some strong new stats on the new deals one in the fourth quarter. I was just hoping to get some color there. You mentioned some telco [ph] some win to win back, but for the new wins how many are going to new customers, how many are share gains, how many are just additional sales into the same customers. Mark Begor : Bill it\u2019s probably hard to split, it would just tell you that it\u2019s all of the above. First off, new wins as your competitive takeaway is hard and it\u2019s one, we all work on, but we\u2019ve got a handful of those, so that\u2019s in that bucket. New products are really a fuel for us, whether it\u2019s InstaTouch or Ignite rollout or some of the new products in Scores that we talked about that we got in the market place. Those are bread and butter, really helping our customers grow their originations, solving on fraud. So that\u2019s a positive and then share gains, we had a handful of those too. I think you\u2019re talking about USIS in your comments, that\u2019s where your question is directed. But of course broadly that\u2019s the fuel for our growth in Equifax is to look for expanding either new customers, new verticals, penetration and share gains with existing customers, new products are really a big fuel for growth in. I hope you get a sense of the focus we have around the new products. It\u2019s a real priority of mine. It\u2019s one that I think our tech transformation is going to leverage, it\u2019s going to give us real fuel in 2020 and 2021 and beyond as we go forward to really be more aggressive around funding new products, investing in new products and then bringing into marketplace. Q \u2013 Bill Warmington : And for the follow-up question, just wanted to see if you get an update on the FICO partnership, how that\u2019s been going and maybe some comments on the Inflection Score that you put in together with Verisk? Mark Begor : Yes, first on the FICO partnership, we announced that last March we were in the marketplace with our integrated decisioning system inside FICO with our data piped in there and we\u2019re in with a handful of customer POC\u2019s, we\u2019ve got a handful of customer wins around the globe, so we\u2019re pleased with the performance with FICO and I think you know, we\u2019re rolling out some products including an AML KYC here in the United States that\u2019s going to be in market in the first quarter and we got some other opportunities there so. So there\u2019s a great collaboration between Equifax and FICO around how we can leverage our respective capabilities in the marketplace and we\u2019ll look forward to that growth going forward. Score with Verisk is new, it\u2019s just in the marketplace. We\u2019ve had good response from customers so far, I think it\u2019s another example what I like to do and we like to do is really collaborating strong partners like FICO or Verisk to really leverage our respective asset and market capabilities to bring new solutions to the marketplace and that\u2019s just another example. So that much is newly launched in the marketplace. Q \u2013 Bill Warmington : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Next question will come from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Q \u2013 Jeff Meuler : It sounds like the given the CapEx guidance for 2020, that depreciation is going to continue to build in 2021. So can you give us some sense of once you\u2019re through EFX 2020 and I know there\u2019s some spillover into 2021, what is CapEx go to as a percentage of revenue on an ongoing basis because I think 25% development savings are both OpEx and CapEx. So that would be per one of the questions, so we can get to EBITDA less CapEx. And then part two, on the 15% plus of tax savings within COGS. Do you get the substantial majority of that on a gross basis in 2022 and I understand there could be reinvestment, just trying to figure out the timing of when you\u2019ll get the step up on that? Mark Begor : Jeff, you\u2019re leading us quite tactfully into a financial framework so let me give you my best response to that. I think the very good questions in \u2013 first of the CapEx, we\u2019re not ready to give 2021 guidance, but or financial framework for our capital allocation in the future. But we\u2019ve been clear with you that expect number one, the incremental spend that we\u2019ve had in 2018, 2019 and 2020 to fund the EFX 2020 cloud transformation. We\u2019ve been very clear that\u2019s going to come down in 2021 and we\u2019ll continue a more normal rate going forward meaning versus this incremental rate that we\u2019ve had in 2018, 2019 and 2020 and we\u2019ve really shown you what the incremental dollars are so I think you can think about what it looks like on the other side. And then as you pointed out, we\u2019ve also been clear that we expect to see development savings meaning with a new tax act [ph] with a single standardized set of products, we expect to see savings in the future, so that will be a part of that CapEx, - benefit in the future post-2020 where we get the full run rate will be something will come to you when we put the financial framework in place. On the operating cost savings, we\u2019ve also been clear that we expect to see inside of our cost structure for technology, real savings from going from legacy to cloud. That is, we have some of that feathering in our guidance within our numbers for 2020, that will continue to accelerate through the year as we decommission legacy environments and that will continue into 2021 and we\u2019re not ready to give run rate on that, but we\u2019ve tried to give you both by sharing what we view is the duplicate cost as well as that guidance around our expectation of 15% to 20% operating cost savings from technology going forward. So you can think about what Equifax looks like in the future as you know, those two benefits with along with \u2013 we expect some accretion to our top line from ability to rollout more new products from the new technology investments are the three benefits that we\u2019re driving as part of this big tech investment. Q \u2013 Jeff Meuler : Okay and then, just how meaningful is this EWS data hub concept like the new data sources beyond [indiscernible] income data just any additional color on that or how many [indiscernible] specs? Mark Begor : Yes, it\u2019s another element Jeff. I think we\u2019ve been very clear that we think more data results and better decisions for our customers and EWS has a very unique position in a lot of verticals with their income and employment data, that they provide as you know it\u2019s really the only place to go to get that data set and a lot of our customers have to go to other data sets to get other data and either us building that out, us partnering on it or making acquisitions to add those data sets. We think is another lever for growth for EWS. It\u2019s part of that theme that I view as the \u2013 with the team internally and with you and others in the investment community that while Workforce Solutions is clearly our best business. It\u2019s performing way above the rest of Equifax. We think about it being in the second inning with the opportunities in front it, both in its core business but also in what it can do around things like leveraging its market position and its unique data assets with other capabilities in order to bring more value to our customers. Q \u2013 Jeff Meuler : Thanks Mark. Welcome back, JD. Operator : Our next question will come from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Q \u2013 Andrew Nicholas : You touched briefly on your decision to increase your ownership stake to 100% ECIS in India, which obviously is faster in market. Can you talk a little bit more about your business in India today how you think about the opportunity set there? And then any color on ECIS\u2019s competitive positioning that would be helpful. Mark Begor : It\u2019s a business as you know we\u2019ve been in for long time. We like the market a lot. We had the opportunity and strategically owning 100% of the business makes it easier to operate, easier to control and then we kind of own our whole destiny. So we\u2019re very pleased to move forward on that. I think it\u2019s a market we want to be in, it\u2019s a market that we want to grow. You may know that we\u2019re doing a build of workforce solutions and India is an example, we started that a couple years ago and that\u2019s got some traction on it. We just think it\u2019s a market that we want to play in and one that\u2019s a big market. Q \u2013 Andrew Nicholas : Great and then, just back on organic revenue growth guidance. Just asking another way, can you just walk us through what you consider to be the primary factors that would drive you to the top and bottom and so off that guide, outside of any changes to mortgage inquiry volumes? Thanks. Mark Begor : Yes, I\u2019ll give you a few thoughts. I don\u2019t want to go too far in this. Obviously USIS is still not back to where it was before the cyber event and we\u2019re convinced. I\u2019ve been very clear it\u2019s not a matter if, it\u2019s only when. Their recovery which we see great momentum, if that accelerates that\u2019s a real positive. For us, near term in, long-term so that\u2019s a very positive one. International, I think as you know, we gave guidance and where we expect the year to be, but we\u2019re still battling some economic headwinds. Brexit while it\u2019s resolved. There\u2019s still some uncertainty on implementation and what it\u2019s going to do to the economy over there, so I think that\u2019s a little bit of a headwind. Latin America seems to have settled down, but it tends to be temporary there always issues and challenges down there and of course Australia, we\u2019ve seen some positive momentum. The recent wildfires there, some are saying could have economic impact there. So I think that\u2019s another factor in there and then the real positive is obviously, Workforce Solutions has some great momentum, is performing extremely well that\u2019s kind of bedrock inside of Equifax that we\u2019ve got a lot of confidence in that they continue to perform, they perform last year above our expectations quite significantly and we expect them to continue to perform very, very well in 2020. John Gamble : Just wanted to be clear. So we provided overall guidance and we provided mortgage [indiscernible] inquiry guidance. We didn\u2019t give mortgage revenue guidance or non-mortgage revenue guidance and again just to repeat where we started, right? So we did say flat for the total mortgage inquiry market, but people should keep in mind that historically our revenue has performed better than the overall mortgage inquiry market in some cases substantial, so that\u2019s a judgment you\u2019re going to have to make for yourself. Q \u2013 Andrew Nicholas : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Next question will come from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Unidentified Participant : Brian on for George. So I was looking at your 2020 revenue guidance which I know comes below your prior long-term target 6% to 8%. I know you haven\u2019t reinstated financial targets yet, but based on customer conversation. To what degree do you believe long-term growth potential [indiscernible]? Mark Begor : Again, that is similar question earlier Brian on long-term guidance. We clearly gave our guidance for 2020, we\u2019re not ready to put a long-term financial framework back in place although we\u2019re working towards that in 2020. We talked about the things we want to see and we\u2019re getting really close to that. So I think I\u2019ll just leave it at that. Unidentified Participant : Okay and then, for your revenue guidance. What level of price increases are baked into that? John Gamble : We didn\u2019t give specific information on price increases, right. Generally speaking there are some level of price increase in the market. However for credit reports in general, if you think about those, they tend to go down in price overtime. So we haven\u2019t given specific price increase guidance as part of this process. Unidentified Participant : Okay, great. Thanks. John Gamble : And operator, we have time for one more. Operator : Right and our final question will come from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Shlomo Rosenbaum : The company used to just give straight out organic growth excluding mortgage and I was just wondering, there\u2019s a lot of positivity in terms of the sales momentum. It\u2019s not number though that you\u2019re providing now and I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more, just clarity, as the rubber meets the road the organic growth of the business excluding the mortgage is just so that we can track was it a little bit up, was it a little bit down. Where are we doing in terms of actual sales and things coming into revenue? John Gamble : We actually are giving that \u2013 we gave that number at each quarter last year right in terms of organic, non-mortgage growth. We indicated this quarter it was up slightly, last quarter I think was just under 3% and I think we gave it each of the first two quarters as well. So we\u2019re trying to give that indication and we\u2019re also trying to separately give a view of just what the market did, so you can have some perspective. So I think the depth of information is actually quite good in terms of how USIS is performing to let you kind of disaggregate the performance by piece. Shlomo Rosenbaum : So this \u2013 I\u2019m talking about for the whole company, so the numbers you\u2019re referring are for the whole company? John Gamble : That\u2019s for USIS. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay and just if I took the whole company together just in mortgage and if I look it as 8.5% growth minus 4% that would be implied by inquires. Mark Begor : Shlomo, we do give mortgage as what percentage of the total company mortgage revenue is, right. So I think from that you can get a good view as what mortgage revenue is for the entire company and how it\u2019s changing and that information we also provide. Shlomo Rosenbaum : So is it going up or down, let me just \u2013 it\u2019s just a question? If I look at it, the mortgage \u2013 the non-mortgage revenue organically up or down. I know it\u2019s choppy. I\u2019m just trying to see if I can do the calculation, the way I used to do it. John Gamble : So that isn\u2019t specifically we disclose, right. But I kind of walk you through, what we do disclose and I think the information is available for you to do whatever analytics you like. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay and then what drove the strong EBITDA margins in international? John Gamble : Yes, Mark walked through that in his discussion. So we got back to growth, they did some very signification cost reduction actions as we take a look at fourth quarter of 2018 and 2019 through that entire period. So their cost structure got nicely better and as they return to growth, they got a lot of leverage from that in the fourth quarter and they also had some benefit from income from some minority investment. So those three things drove higher EBITDA margin. Shlomo Rosenbaum : So is there, where the cost takeouts are the way that we can look at them kind of establishing [indiscernible] that ramps we should be ramping from this kind of level? John Gamble : The significant majority of the cost actions I think that they plan to take have been executed. So yes, this is kind of basic cost we\u2019re starting from, the base that we ended within 4Q, 2019. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay, great. Thank you very much. John Gamble : Okay, we\u2019d like to thank everybody for participating and we\u2019ll talk to you again soon. Operator : And that does conclude our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

I\u2019d like to now turn the conference to your host, Mr. Jeffrey Dodge. Please go ahead, sir. Jeffrey Dodge : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to today\u2019s conference call. I\u2019m Jeff Dodge and on today\u2019s call with me are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today on our website at www.equifax.com in the Investor Relations section under Earnings Calls, Presentations and Webcasts. During the call today, we will be making reference to certain materials that can also be found under the Earnings Calls, Presentations and Webcast section. These materials are labeled Q1 2020 Earnings Release Presentation. During this call, we\u2019ll also be making some certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the impact of COVID-19, and economic conditions on our future operations that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain Risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2019 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. Also, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. For the first quarter of 2020, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes costs associated with acquisition-related amortization expense, gains on fair market value adjustments of equity investments, the foreign currency impact of certain intercompany loans, a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets, a tax benefit on a legal settlement related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident, the income tax effects of stock awards recognized upon vesting or settlement and foreign currency losses for remeasuring the Argentinean peso-denominated net monetary assets. Adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax - excuse me, also excludes legal and professional fees related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident, principally fees related to our outstanding litigation and government investigations, as well as the incremental nonrecurring project costs designed to enhance our technology and data security. This includes projects to implement systems and processes to enhance our technology and data security infrastructure, as well as projects to replace and substantially consolidate our global network and systems, as well as the cost to manage these projects. These projects that will transform our technology infrastructure and further enhance our data security were incurred throughout 2018 and 2019 and are expected to occur in 2020 and 2021. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to Equifax, adding back interest expense net of interest income, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, and also, as is the case for adjusted EPS, excluding costs related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident, gains on fair market value adjustments and equity investments, the foreign currency impact of certain intercompany loans and foreign currency losses from remeasuring the Argentinean peso-denominated net monetary assets. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our website. Now I\u2019d like to turn it over to Mark. Mark Begor : Thanks, Jeff. And good morning, everyone. We are all facing unprecedented times during the COVID global pandemic. I hope you and your families are safe in managing in this unusual environment. We\u2019d like to start by thanking the dedicated and selfless health care professionals, first responders, volunteers and others around the world who are fighting the frontline pandemic. Their dedication and sacrifice is nothing less than heroic. The economic impact from the COVID-19 pandemic is still unfolding and will clearly be deeper than anything we\u2019ve seen in our lifetimes. To help with today\u2019s discussion, we posted a first quarter 2020 Investor Relations presentation, which is available on the Investor Relations section of our website under Events and Presentations. We plan to walk through the presentation on today\u2019s call if you want to pull it up. At Equifax, as we execute during this pandemic at our work from home protocol and business continuity plans, we\u2019re focused on five critical priorities highlighted on slide four. Number one, the health and safety of our employees and their families, number two, continuing to deliver for our customers with the highest level of service and supporting our customers with new data and analytical services they will need as they respond to the pandemic and economic impacts and their business \u2013 their businesses and priorities change. Number three, supporting consumers as they are challenged by the economic impacts of COVID-19 by providing free credit reports and financial education, number four, executing on our cloud technology, data and security transformation. Our focus and investment in our cloud-native technology data and security transformation are continuing at the same levels we had originally planned for 2020, with a goal of accelerating our cloud-based data and technology capabilities to make them available more rapidly to our customers. Funding and executing of our cloud technology transformation continues to be a priority for Equifax. And number five, continuing on the new product momentum from 2019 with NPIs tailored off Equifax\u2019s unique data assets for the recession environment. We started to accelerate new product rollouts in 2019, and that focus is continuing in 2020. Like most companies, we initiated our COVID-19 business continuity plans in mid-March, which included activating our crisis management team reporting directly to me, as well as instituting ongoing interaction with our Board to keep them apprised of our plans. We have over 9,000 employees working from home across our global workforce. Only essential roles in customer support and data center operations continue to work from our facilities. We virtually eliminated travel with limited exceptions for essential customer or regulatory business needs. For our close to 2,000 associates and essential roles that are still working from our facilities, we have implemented social distancing of workspaces, aggressive cleaning and sanitizing and other actions to make sure our sites are as safe as possible. We\u2019ve been in the work from home mode and no-travel environment for five weeks, actually now going on six weeks, and are operated continuously and effectively for our customers. We believe our team\u2019s efficiency and productivity is continuing at levels at or better than pre-crisis. We are seeing tremendous benefits from our move to cloud-native tools that are driving significant collaboration as a part of our cloud technology and data transformation. Our development teams are working almost exclusively on Google Cloud platform and Amazon Cloud services, and their efficiency continues at very high levels. And our movement to cloud-based security tools over the past 30 months has also proven to be highly beneficial in this new work from home environment. I hope this gives you a strong sense that Equifax is executing and delivering well during these challenging times for our customers and consumers, while continuing our cloud and new product investments for the future. I\u2019m also pleased with the team we have in place to manage through these challenging COVID-19 crisis. They are battle-tested with deep domain and experience. My personal experience leading GE Capital\u2019s card business during the 2009 global financial crisis gives me a very unique customer lens on the value of data and analytics in a recession environment. Moving now to our results for the first quarter. Let\u2019s turn to slide five. We\u2019re very pleased with our financial performance in the first quarter as both revenue and adjusted EPS significantly exceeded our expectations and our guidance for the quarter. The first quarter delivered our strongest performance since the 2017 cyber event and continued our strong momentum from the second half of 2019, where our organic growth revenue rate jumped to over 9% during the last 6 months of 2019. First quarter revenue of $958 million was up over 15% in constant currency and up 14% on an organic constant currency basis. We had strong revenue growth driven by our US B2B businesses, USIS and EWS that collectively were up a very strong 22% overall with Workforce Solutions up an outstanding 32% and USIS up a very strong 15%. US mortgage market inquiries were at historic high levels given the low interest rate environment with inquiries up almost 42%. International revenue was up 3% in constant currency, and global consumer continued their path back to growth with revenue up over 3% consistent with fourth quarter and their third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. These results were dampened by the COVID-19 lockdown impacts during the last two weeks of March, which reduced first quarter revenue by around $20 million. Adjusted EPS of $1.40 per share was up 16% and well above our expectations and the top end of the guidance we provided in February. As we discussed on prior calls, we incurred redundant systems costs in the quarter, including incremental D&A, cloud and other operating costs of $15 million or about $0.09 a share, which dampened our earnings growth rate. Adjusted EBITDA was up a strong 20% with margins of 32.4% that were up 190 basis points compared with the first quarter of 2019 given our strong revenue growth and the cost actions that we took in the fourth quarter of 2018 and first quarter of 2019, with strong margin growth in USIS, EWS and International.  As we discussed on prior calls, we expect our EBITDA to grow more rapidly than EPS in the coming years due to the increased amortization of our incremental cloud transformation investments. FX movements in the quarter were more negative to revenue and adjusted EPS than expected by $13 million and $0.02 per share, respectively. Our constant dollar revenue growth through February of 15% provides a good view of the continued strong progress we are making across all of our businesses and the positive momentum of Equifax over the past three quarters. This performance positions us well to navigate the COVID-19 economic headwinds. I\u2019ll shift now to a discussion of the first quarter performance of each of the four business units, as highlighted on slide six. Later in my comments, I will discuss in some detail the impacts we are seeing in April as the coronavirus lockdown impact portions of our business and their implications for our financial performance in the second quarter. USIS revenue of $343 million in the first quarter was up 15% versus the first quarter of 2019 on a reported basis, and 13% on an organic basis. For the quarter, online revenue was up 16%. Online non-mortgage revenue was up 3% in the quarter. And online non-mortgage organic revenue declined 1%, reflecting the decline in March volumes associated with declines in economic activity from the COVID-19 pandemic. Through February, USIS online non-mortgage revenue was up 7% in total and a solid 2.5% on an organic basis. We saw nice growth across auto, direct-to-consumer, banking, insurance, which was partially offset by declines in telco in the first two months of the first quarter. In telco, we won back primary share with a major customer beginning in March, which is a positive going into second quarter. The strengthening of online revenue through February is very positive and another sign of our continued progress in USIS commercially. This positive momentum in the first quarter and second half of 2019 will serve USIS well as we enter the COVID-19 economic environment. Mortgage solutions were up a very strong 33% in the quarter, and lower than mortgage market inquiry growth given the mix shift in the quarter from mortgage solutions to online. Mortgage solutions continue to perform very well in this low interest rate environment. USIS' Financial Marketing Service business revenue was down 2% in the quarter compared to last year. Revenue declines were due to lower-than-expected project revenue in March brought on by the COVID-19 lockdowns. I\u2019m very encouraged by the performance of Sid Singh and his USIS team in the first quarter, both in their strong growth through February, and in the speed at which they are adapting product offerings and their selling efforts in March to meet the substantial change in customer needs from the COVID-19 pandemic. This follows USIS' momentum in the second half of 2019. Later in my comments, I\u2019ll discuss the success we are having across Equifax in focusing our efforts with customers on solutions leveraging our unique data assets to help them manage through this new COVID-19 recession environment. US is accelerating commercial activity and new deal pipelines remain strong. During the current market conditions, the number of pipeline opportunities as of the end of March was up 6% compared to December 2019 and up 33% from March 2019. And our win rate in the first quarter was up about 500 basis points from the first quarter of 2019. We are continuing to close new deals with customers in the past few weeks, even with the COVID-19 work environment. And we expect strong mortgage growth in the second quarter in the current low interest rate environment. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins of 44.7% were up 170 basis points from the first quarter of 2019, driven by the increase in revenue, partially offset by increased royalty costs, as well as the increased investments in new product development, data analytics, increased consumer support costs and redundant systems costs. Turning now to Workforce Solutions. They had another exceptional quarter with revenue up a very strong 32% versus the first quarter of 2019. Rudy Ploder and his EWS team delivered the highest growth quarter for EWS since we acquired the business in 2007. And on a run rate basis for the 12 months ended March 31st, EWS crossed the $1 billion revenue mark for the first time in their history, both huge milestones. Verification Services revenue was up an extremely strong 48% compared with the prior year, driven by outstanding revenue growth in verification and mortgage. The strong Verification Services revenue growth also reflects continued year-over-year growth in work number active records, as well as the rollout of new products in mortgage, talent solutions and other verticals and continued expansion of system-to-system integration with customers, which you know is really critical. EWS and Verification Services non-mortgage revenue growth was a strong 9% and 15% respectively, compared to last year. Through February, Verification Services non-mortgage revenue growth was up 18% with strong double-digit growth across key non-mortgage verticals, including government, auto, talent solutions and debt management. Non-mortgage verifier revenue growth for the quarter was up 15%, but down from the 18% run rate we saw in February, reflecting the COVID-19 impact in the latter half of March, principally in auto, debt management and talent solutions. Work number database closed the first quarter with 105 million active records and 80 million active unique individuals, up 18% compared to March 2019. And the database now represents about half of US non-farm payroll. Our contributors are also growing rapidly from just under 30,000 a year ago to over 700,000 companies contributing in the first quarter. Growing TWN [ph] records drive hit rates that translates into revenue almost immediately. We expect to continue TWN contributor and record growth in second quarter in 2020. The work number database is Equifax\u2019s most unique and differentiated asset, particularly with the scale and currency of the database that can provide incremental value to our customers in today\u2019s challenging times, where there is so much income and employment uncertainty around consumers in the US. Through February, our Employer Services business revenues were flat compared to first quarter 2019. This was slightly better than the performance we saw over much of 2019 and reflected growth in our I-9 and other talent management businesses, offset by declines in unemployment insurance claims management and our Workforce Analytics business. For the quarter, Employer Services revenue was up 2%, with our unemployment insurance claims management business up 8% organically in the quarter due to very substantial - due to a very substantial increase in unemployment claims volume in the second half of March, with daily volumes up six fold during the last two weeks of March or the quarter given the rise in US unemployment filings. We expect continued substantial growth in unemployment claims in the second quarter. John will discuss this in more detail when he covers March and April trends in a few minutes. The strong verifier revenue growth resulted in strong adjusted EBITDA margins of 51.5%, an increase of 210 basis points compared to last year due to the strong revenue growth and proactive cost management, which more than offset increased royalty costs and our redundant system costs from the technology transformation. Workforce Solutions is an outstanding business that continues to deliver very strong results even in challenging times. John will discuss later that we expect Workforce Solutions to deliver strong growth again in the second quarter. International revenue of $216 million was up 3% in constant currency and down 4% on a reported basis. Through February, International constant currency revenue was up a strong 8% with organic revenue growth also up 7.5%. The strong growth through February was a continuation of International\u2019s strong second half 2019 momentum. Their commercial momentum in the first quarter positions the International business to operate well in the new COVID-19 environment. Asia Pacific, which is primarily our Australian and New Zealand business and now also includes our India business had first quarter revenue of $70 million, up 3% in constant currency year-over-year. Through February however, Asia Pacific was up a strong 5% in local currency and Australia grew over 4%, both stronger than our expectations. Broad and ID and commercial online were both very strong in Australia, up 20% and 9%, respectively and marketing services continues to decline but at a much slower rate than in 2019. Shifting now to Europe. Our European business with revenue of $66 million was down 1% year-over-year in constant currency, with the credit business and debt management businesses also down 1%. And our credit business is negatively impacted by the decline in the economic activity from the COVID-19 pandemic in the second half of March. Through February in Europe, we showed strong constant currency growth of 8.5%. Our UK and Spain credit businesses grew 7% in total through February. In the UK, we saw growth in our financial services vertical, both direct and through reseller partners. We also saw growth in the gaming vertical and from new products launched in 2019 in open banking and digital marketing. European debt management revenue was up over 10% through February as we saw higher debt placements with the UK government. As John will discuss shortly, we are expecting a significant decline in debt management revenue in the UK in the second quarter as the UK government has suspended tax collection activities during the COVID crisis, as well as declines in our European credit businesses due to customers pausing on collection activities during the early phases of COVID-19. Shifting now to Latin America. Our business in Latin America delivered revenue of $43 million in the first quarter and was up 9% in local currency. However, through February, Latin America was up a strong 15% in local currency, led by strong double-digit growth in Argentina and Mexico, low-teens growth in Chile and Ecuador and high single growth in Uruguay. Our Latin American businesses are adding new logos and benefiting from the rapid adoption of Ignite and Interconnect in their markets. Canada revenue of $37 million was up 2% in local currency in the first quarter. Unlike most of our international markets, Canada has a mortgage business that benefits like the US from lower interest rates. Revenue growth in our Canadian mortgage business in the first quarter which makes up just over 10% of Canadian revenue were largely offset by declines in our consumer and commercial businesses during the last two weeks of March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Through February, Canada was up 5%, driven by consumer credit, specifically mortgage, and our commercial and ID and fraud businesses. International adjusted EBITDA margins at 27.8% were up a strong 250 basis points compared to last year. The strong growth in margins reflects the benefit of revenue growth and the cost actions implemented by the International team in the fourth quarter of 2018 and throughout 2019. Shifting now to Global Consumer Solutions, their revenue was up 3% on a reported basis in the quarter and constant currency basis in the quarter. Their third - this was their third consecutive quarter of growth. Global Consumer direct revenue, which represents about 40% of total GCS revenue, was down about 2% year-over-year in the quarter. We saw mid single digit growth across the UK and Canada\u2019s combined consumer direct businesses. While the US consumer direct business declined 7% in the first quarter, it continued to improve from the fourth quarter of 2019 and still represents a substantial improvement from the double-digit decline in the US Consumer Direct business we saw in the third quarter of 2019 and since the cyber event in 2017. Sequentially versus fourth quarter, total subscribers are stable to slightly increasing across the US, Canada and UK, which is an encouraging sign as we move into second quarter. Our GCS partner businesses increased 8% in the quarter as a result of growth from our US free model partners, our benefits channel and our breach business, offset by revenue declines with some of our paid model partners. Our partners business was up a solid 9% through February as we saw nice growth in our benefits business and event-based businesses, as well as our traditional partners. Revenue was negatively impacted in the last couple of weeks of March by declines at some partners, particularly in the lead gen space, and we expect COVID-19 impacts at our partners to affect our second quarter partner revenue. John will discuss this in a few minutes, when he discusses April trends. GCS adjusted EBITDA margins of 23.1% decreased 80 basis points compared to the prior year, primarily driven by mix shifts and increased COVID-19 consumer call center support costs in late March. We also increased marketing spend in the US and Canada in the quarter. With the substantial weakening in several of our business units and verticals that began in the second half of March from the coronavirus pandemic, we took actions to tight cost - to tighten controls all over our cost and to dramatically reduce travel. We\u2019ve frozen hiring except for roles directly related to consumer support. The EFX2020 technology and data transformation or new products will also continue at current levels, and we\u2019ve also reduced discretionary spending across the company. At this stage, we\u2019re looking at $90 million of discretionary cost takeout versus our business plan for 2020 and, if necessary, we\u2019re prepared to take additional cost actions as required. That said, we will take actions to protect our franchise during this economic event. As I mentioned earlier, we are continuing our cloud technology and data transformation investment spending at planned levels and our new product growth initiatives, because of the significant strategic and operational value from both initiatives. These strategic priorities will benefit Equifax during the COVID economic impacts and power us into recovery. Shifting now to trends we are seeing post the start of the COVID-19 crisis. Starting in mid-March, Equifax began seeing revenue impacts in several of our business units and verticals from the broad lockdown actions taken globally to slow the spread of COVID-19. To help as you form your view on the potential impact of this pandemic, we wanted to provide you with a couple of things. First, our perspective on which portions of our businesses are recession-resilient today. Second, our performance during the global financial crisis and a comparison of our business mix in 2009 compared to today or 2020. And then last, John will cover current revenue trends we\u2019re seeing in our daily transactions in over the past few weeks. To estimate the impact the recession could have on Equifax or will have on Equifax, we assigned our line of businesses into three categories. First, recession-resistant. These businesses have drivers that are not directly aligned with economic activity in the recession and we expect them to grow through COVID-19. The best examples of these businesses are Workforce Solutions, our US mortgage business and our government lines of businesses that we expect will continue to grow from the uniqueness of the data, including TWN or from the low interest rate environments, including mortgage. Second, countercyclical businesses and these are businesses that perform better during the recession, and the best example is our Unemployment Claims Management business and Workforce Solutions, where we expect significant growth in Workforce Solutions revenue from growing unemployment claims in the United States. And third, our recession-impacted businesses. These are businesses that are directly impacted by economic activity in contraction and recession and include auto, cards and P loans, where both consumer activity declines or lender activity is contracted for risk containment reasons. We expect these business lines to have negative revenue growth in a recession. Today, about 65% of Equifax' US businesses are either recession-resistant or countercyclical and about 55% of our global business is recession-resistant or countercyclical. This compares in the 2009 global financial crisis where only about 40% of our businesses were either recession-resistant or countercyclical compared to the 55% today. This meaningful growth - the meaningful growth in EWS and US mortgage since 2009 positions Equifax well for the COVID-19 recession. As shown on slide seven, during the 2009 global financial crisis, Equifax performed very well and exhibited the resiliency you would expect from a data analytics business. In 2009, we saw only a 6% decline in total revenue for the year, with our largest single quarterly decline at 10% in the first quarter of 2009 at the deepest point of the recession. The largest declines in 2009 were in international, with smaller declines in USIS as we benefited from growth in mortgage from low interest rates. Importantly, Workforce Solutions grew throughout the period and showed substantial growth of 17% in 2009, both as the work number continued to grow records and contributors during the global financial crisis, which drove verification hit rates and we saw strong unemployment insurance claims revenue growth from growing unemployment levels in the US in 2009, and we expect a similar pattern in 2020. Shifting now to slide eight. Equifax business mix is better positioned for an economic event today than it was during the global financial crisis. Strong Workforce Solutions growth has increased their relative size in Equifax from 10% of revenue in 2009 to 27% percent of revenue today. And US mortgage has grown from 12% of Equifax revenue in 2009 to over 20% today. In addition, Workforce Solutions growth in revenue and significant margin expansion has their - increased their percentage of total Equifax EBITDA to 30% today from only 11% in 2008. Over the last 12 years, Workforce Solutions' outsized revenue growth and the expansion of US mortgage, as well as the growth of less cyclical government-related businesses, including the growth of Workforce Analytics has increased Equifax recessions resistancy and countercyclical businesses from 40% of revenue in 2009 to over 15% - over 55% today, which we believe has significantly improved our capability to continue to invest and execute during the COVID-19 economic impacts. Our cloud technology and data transformation execution is well-timed as the benefits begin to roll in during 2020 and accelerate in \u201821 and \u201822. The cloud transformation investments have allowed us to more rapidly access multi-data assets in the new cloud data fabric environment and deliver new products to market with speed to address the new COVID economic challenges for our customers. The cloud transformation will improve our revenue growth, cost structure, margins and cash generation in the future. Clearly, the COVID-19 recession is much different than 2009 and like anything we\u2019ve ever seen before, but Equifax is a stronger business with the scale of Workforce Solutions and US mortgage and much better positioned to weather the COVID-19 economic impacts with our unique data and technology leadership. Our financial performance and strength allows us to continue to invest in the cloud transformation and new products, which will benefit us in the future. I\u2019ll now turn the discussion over to John, so he can cover recent financial trends we are seeing in the business units, as well as an update on our liquidity, technology cost savings and some other financial items. I\u2019ll come back and review our progress on the cloud, technology and data transformation, new products and our vision for the future of Equifax in \u201821 and \u201822. John? John Gamble : Thanks, Mark. As a reminder, I will generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis, but will refer to non-GAAP results as well. First, a few items in 1Q \u201820. In the first quarter, total non-recurring or one-time costs principally related to the cybersecurity incident and our transformation were $81 million, a decrease of $16 million compared to the prior year. The cost includes $78 million of technology and security and $3 million for legal fees. In the first quarter, general corporate expense was $134 million. Excluding non-recurring costs, adjusted general corporate expense for the quarter was $91 million, up $17 million from 1Q \u201819. The increase reflects the higher security technology and equity compensation costs in 2020 as compared to 2019 that we discussed with you in February. For 1Q \u201820, the effective tax rate used in calculating adjusted EPS was 25.3% and in line with the rate we guided to in February. Interest expense for the quarter was $31 million, an increase of $4 million from 1Q \u201819 and in line with our expectations due to financing the $341 million of legal settlements payments made during 3Q \u201819. Our liquidity and balance sheet remains strong. As indicated on slide nine, we had almost $1.6 billion in available liquidity at March 31, including $370 million cash and available borrowing capacity on our bank credit NAR facilities of $1.2 billion. We have no debt maturities in 2020. In 2021, we have debt maturities beginning in June and we\u2019ll likely pay the remaining $355 million of our US comprehensive consumer settlement in the first quarter of \u201821. In addition, we recently worked with our credit facility lenders to modify our covenants beginning in 2Q \u201820 through 2021. At March 31, our leverage ratio was 2.7 on the basis of our amended credit agreement, well inside of our new leverage covenant of 4.5 times. This amendment provides us with significant and enhanced financial flexibility to support the continued execution of our Equifax 2020 cloud technology and data transformation and investment in new products and capabilities during this recession. We are watching current trends closely and will continue to manage proactively to protect these critical investments. This also gives us the ability to manage our liquidity and balance sheet. 1Q \u201820 operating cash flow of $31 million was flat with 1Q \u201819. As you know, our cash flow in the first quarter of each year is low as we make bonus payments or annual 401(k) match, dividends and interest payments all in 1Q. We also made legal settlement payments related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident in 1Q \u201820 of $47 million related to the $100 million accrued in 4Q \u201819. Capital expenditures in 1Q \u201820 was $88 million, down $27 million from 2019. We have approximately $400 million of remaining payments on litigation and regulatory outcomes related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident. About $53 million will be paid in 2020, predominantly in 2Q. The timing of when the remaining approximately $350 million of the US consumer restitution fund is paid depends on the resolution of the appeals filed related to this case, which timing is uncertain at this time. At this time, we do not expect to fund the remainder of the settlement until early 2021. Details on the status of all outstanding regulatory and legal issues will be provided in our 1Q 2020 Form 10-Q. Turning to slide 10, entitled Cloud Technology and Data Transformation 2020 impacts. As we discussed in our February call, as we put our new cloud-native systems into production, we begin to depreciate these new systems and incur the cloud and other operating costs of running these new cloud-native systems. It will generally - as well as the costs related to our legacy systems. It will generally take 6 to 12 months from the time the cloud-native system is fully in production to transition a legacy exchange or decisioning system to a new cloud-native system. During that time period, in addition to the depreciation on the new cloud-native systems, we incur the cloud and other operating costs of the new system, as well as the operating costs of the legacy systems. As 2020 is a transition year and the decommissioning of legacy systems is not expected to substantially occur until late 4Q \u201820 and 2021, we will incur these additional redundant system transition costs for much of 2020. For 2020, we continue to expect these additional redundant system transition costs to be in the range of $0.40 to $0.50 per share, with increased depreciation representing about two thirds of this additional cost and cloud costs, net of any legacy system decommissioning savings, representing approximately one third of this additional cost. At the midpoint of this range, this is a total of about $75 million, with $50 million of increased depreciation and $25 million of incremental cloud and other operating costs. In 1Q \u201820, these additional redundant systems costs were about $15 million or $0.09 per share. As we move into 2021, we expect the savings from the decommissioning of legacy systems to begin to exceed the cloud and other operating costs from our new cloud-native systems, resulting in a net benefit to COGS at some point in the second half of 2021. This net benefit to COGS will continue to grow in 2021 and through 2022, as well as customers migrating to our transform infrastructure and we fully decommission our legacy systems. As we have said, and is shown in slide 11, we expect to generate significant cost savings from our cloud technology and data transformation. A 15% plus savings in the technology cost, excluding depreciation and amortization of our cost of goods sold, excluding onetime items. In 2019, technology costs represent about 45% of total COGS and full run rate savings in COGS from the completion of the technology transformation on a 2019 basis would have been about $90 million. A 25% reduction in our development expense is expected to be generated when we complete the transformation. Again, at 2019 development expense run rate levels, this is a savings of about $35 million per year. At 2019 cost levels, these two items would drive cost savings of up to $125 million and margins to invest in new products and growth, as well as higher EBITDA. And capital spending levels are expected to decrease 35% from the 10.5% of revenue we saw in 2019. We believe our cloud-native infrastructure and dramatically reduced application footprint should allow us to be more capital-efficient than our peers to at or under 7% of revenue. From 2019\u2019s elevated spend levels this is a reduction in capital spending of about $115 million per year, which will enhance our long-term cash flow. In total, that is a pre-tax cash savings of about $240 million per year on a full run rate basis using 2019 spend levels as a proxy, substantially strengthening our financial profile and giving us the capability to further invest in new products and capabilities, while enhancing our margins. In addition to the cost and cash benefits from the cloud transformation, we expect our new single data fabric and cloud-based applications to accelerate innovation and new products that will be accretive to our revenue growth rate. We expect to begin to see net COGS savings during second half of \u201821 and are targeting reaching the full run rate of COGS, development expense and capital savings during \u201822. We will certainly reinvest some of the savings, so we will all not follow the margin. We have come a long way since 2018, and are seeing accelerating progress on our cloud technology and data transformation. We are becoming increasingly confident we will achieve our goals. Now let\u2019s take a few minutes to talk about the trends we were seeing in the markets over the past few weeks. Given the very unique nature of the COVID-19 led recession, the best perspective we can provide on the impact on our business is to share the trends we are seeing so far in the month of April. We are unable to forecast the economic event of COVID-19 in our markets. So we are not providing 2020 - sorry, 2Q \u201820 guidance and are removing our guidance for 2020 until we have more visibility on the economy. Slides 12 through 14 show details of revenue trends on a constant currency basis so far during the month of April and their implications on 2Q \u201820 if they were to continue. As you would expect, we have daily transaction reporting broadly available across our business, which we turn into daily revenue estimates. The trends I am sharing are based on this reporting and our view of these directional trends, which principally covers our online business activities, which is about 80% of revenue in the US with lesser coverage in international. As shown on slide 12, USIS represents about 37% of our revenue in the first quarter, of which about 85% is online between OCIS and Mortgage Solutions. Looking at the trend in April, total USIS online revenue is pointed toward down a little over 10% versus 2019. Online mortgage revenue, the sum of tri-merge and online single file, has continued to show strong year-to-year growth in April, up about 15%. Online non-mortgage revenue over the month of April is currently pointed at a decline of about 30% versus last year. As expected, the greatest declines are occurring in auto, banking and insurance verticals from declines in economic activity, with better performance in telco as we regained the primary position with a major customer. The remaining revenue in USIS is Financial Marketing Services, which is offline batch revenue, which performed relatively well in the first quarter and was down about 4% in March. Our assumption is FMS will be down over 20% in the second quarter of \u201820 as it is a blend of marketing-related activity, which we expect to decline consistent with online non-mortgage, offset by portfolio reviews volume, which we expect to perform much better than marketing as the recession unfolds. We do not have a meaningful daily trend for FMS. Workforce Solutions represented about 31% of Equifax revenue in the first quarter of which over 75% is online for Verification Services. Over the last three weeks, Verification Services has showed high growth, but at a level below the 48% increase we saw in 1Q. Based on the April trends and movement growth rates, Verification Services growth appears to be pointed at about a 25% increase over 2019. Mortgage, which is the largest of the Verification Services verticals has been extremely strong, up over 50% over the past three weeks showing substantial growth versus 2019. Non-mortgage verification services is about half government services related to our contract with the Center for Medicare Services and the provisioning of benefits at the state level, with the remaining being talent management, debt services and banking, principally in auto. Non-mortgage verification services, based on the April trends we have seen is pointed toward a decline of about 15%. Government verification services revenue is performing better than commercial verticals as CMS has reopened for applications and we are seeing more benefits activity at the state level. The non-government verticals, principally debt management, talent management and banking have been down consistent with levels seen at USIS with debt management performing much weaker than expected in a traditional recession as our customer base is weighted towards student loans. In Employer Services, unemployment insurance claims management represents about half of the revenue. We expect meaningful revenue growth in UC in the second quarter as we process about one in six unemployment claim filings in the US. Over the past three weeks, claims filings by EWS have averaged about 600,000 per week versus an average in 2019 of 20,000 per week. We expect our UC business to increase by well over 50% versus the just under $30 million of revenue we saw in 2Q \u201819. Workforce Analytics, our W2 business and our Talent Management businesses are principally subscription-based businesses and make up the bulk of the remainder of Employer Services. These businesses are expected to see low single digit percentage declines year-to-year in the second quarter due to limited new customer acquisition. In total, if people trends hold and as well as these assumptions, we expect Employer Services revenue to be up over 35% in the second quarter. Our US B2B businesses, USIS and EWS make up about 67% of Equifax' revenue. The online portion of these businesses make up 54% of Equifax revenue. And based on April trends, online is trending to be up low single digit percent. Overall, based on April trends and assuming they hold throughout 2Q, our US B2B should be up a little under 5% in 2Q \u201820. Moving to slide 13. International represents about 25% of Equifax' revenue of which under half is online across its four regions. Based on April revenue trends, Asia Pacific is pointed to be down about 20 - between 20% and 25%. This excludes revenue from our recent acquisition of the remainder of our India operations, which will be about $2 million in the second quarter. LATAM's April revenue trends also point to a decline of a little over 20%. In April, Canada is seeing more significant declines, pointing to revenue declines of about 40%. In Europe, we have both the CRA business and the debt management business. The CRA business has seen a weakening trend in April and is pointing to a decline at current trends of about 40%. Although not an online business, our debt management business will be significantly impacted in the second quarter with revenue expected to be down almost 60%, reflecting the UK government's suspension of tax-related debt collection activities during the pandemic. Debt management is about one-third of our European business. On the basis of these metrics, in total, International revenue is pacing down over 30% in April. GCS represents about 10% of Equifax revenue. GCS consumer direct, which represents about 40% of the GCS business, saw very limited impact on revenue in the second half of March. Total subscriptions in the US, Canada and the UK are down slightly versus 1Q \u201820 averages with these trends holding relatively stable. Versus 2Q \u201819, US Consumer Direct is expected to be down, reflecting subscriber declines that occurred in 2019. We are seeing overall declines in partner revenue run rate in the high single digit percent range as our partners businesses are impacted by the pandemic. In total, GCS is seeing revenue declines in the high single digit percent so far in April. Although we are certainly seeing meaningful impact in the COVID-19 lockdowns over the past month, the resiliency of our business model and strength of Workforce Solutions and our US mortgage business, as well as GCS to a degree is mitigating this impact, particularly in the US. Due to the uncertainties and forecasting the depth and duration of the recession related to the actions to combat COVID-19, we are not going to provide second quarter guidance and are retracting our full year guidance, as we indicated earlier. We will reinstate guidance when the path of recovery from the COVID-19 recession becomes more clear. However, for perspective on total Equifax 2Q \u20180 performance, as shown on slide 14, we are providing an illustrative second quarter framework to help you think about our performance. To the extent total Equifax revenue continued at the pace I described earlier, based on April trends, 2Q \u201820 revenue would be down about 6.5% to 8.5% on a constant currency basis or $55 million to $75 million versus 2Q \u201819. Based on current FX rates, revenue would be down 8.5% to 10.5% or $75 million to $95 million year-to-year, resulting in 2Q \u201820 revenue of $785 million to $805 million. Adjusted EPS in 2Q \u201820 at these revenue levels could be in the range of $0.78 to $0.88 per share, down 37% to 44% from 2Q \u201819. Slide 19 also provides a walk through explaining the translation versus 2Q \u201819 of the revenue decline to the decline in pretax income and adjusted EPS. Importantly, at these adjusted EPS levels, Equifax will still deliver about $225 million in adjusted EBITDA. This is not guidance. There is still much uncertainty as to what impact the pandemic will have on the economy, our customer\u2019s business activities, any path to opening up the economy and therefore our revenue and earnings. This range provided reflects current variability in trends, not a view of potential quarter outcomes. We are offering this framework as you determine your view of the possible impacts to Equifax revenue in 2Q \u201820 and think about your modeling for Equifax. We hope the detail and framework we provided on the impacts we have seen to date are helpful as you estimate Equifax\u2019s second quarter results. Let me turn it back to Mark. Mark Begor : Thanks, John. I hope our transparency on recent revenue trends and the framework for the second quarter is helpful. Let me wrap up with a discussion on our future. Our $1.25 billion EFX 2020 cloud technology and data transformation and our continuing investment in new products. Turning first to the cloud transformation. As it has only been two months since we last discussed our progress with you on the technology transformation, my discussion today will be abbreviated, and I\u2019ll return to a full update in July. Our investment in the transformation continues to be a top priority during 2020 as we work towards completing the strategic transformation and delivering the topline revenue, cost and cash benefits that John talked about from the investment. We are not seeing any negative impacts on the cloud transformation progress from the new working environment as our technology team was already well versed in remote working capabilities. We remain on track to complete the initial migrations of several large data exchanges by end of the third quarter, including the work number, NCTUE, US Consumer Risk or Acro, IXI Wealth, US Commercial, auto and property data assets. Our DataX exchange will follow in the fourth quarter as we made the decision to migrate DataX to the new cloud environment after the ACRO database conversion or transformation is completed to allow us to leverage the ACRO Cloud exchange for DataX integration. In addition, initial migration of our eID identity validation systems will be completed in April, with customer migrations expected to be completed over the next three to four months. Our new Luminate cloud identity and fraud suite, which includes a new eID as a service, is being developed as a cloud-native solution and is expected to be available to customers in the US and Canada beginning in the third quarter. Our Ignite analytics and machine learning platform that includes attribute and model management capability, as well as the ability for customers to easily and securely ingest their own data is integrated with InterConnect and is now available for customer migrations at AWS and on track to be available at GCP by the end of the second quarter. We continue to make strong progress globally, rolling out Ignite analytics platform with almost 200 customers now using Ignite Direct and Marketplace and more than 30 customers using our patented explainable machine learning or NDT-based models. We are continuing our progress in the migration of our customers on to our new cloud-based systems, including our InterConnect Ignite API framework. As a reminder, this is a common set of services on which we are working to migrate all USIS, EWS and International customers. As of the end of the first quarter, USIS had migrated over 1,200 US customers and International completed migrations with almost 1,000 customers. This is slightly ahead of the pace we discussed with you back in February. We expect this pace to accelerate significantly through 2020 with over 10,000 US customer migrations expected by year end and the vast majority of US customer migrations completed in early 2021. Customer migrations are an important part of our technology transformation and we continue to work closely with customers to define and execute migration plans and speed their access to the events products and services we can increasingly offer with our new cloud-native services. We are seeing the customer migration work continue at a normal pace in the past five weeks of the COVID-19 environment, which is encouraging. We are focused on the execution and where possible, accelerating our cloud technology and data transformation roadmap in 2020 to ensure we deliver the customer and commercial benefits from the transformation and achieve the revenue cost and cash benefits in \u201821 and \u201822. This is a top priority for Equifax. Turning now to slide 15. New product innovation remains a key component of our EFX 2020 strategy and accelerating new product generation is key to our long-term revenue growth. We have an active pipeline of new products with over 100 launches forecast for 2020, which is up from about 90 in 2019 and 60 in 2018. We\u2019re off to a strong start to the year with 34 new product launches in 2020, which is up 2x from the 14 we delivered in the first quarter last year. Increasingly, our new products are leveraging the broad scope and capabilities of our cloud-native production systems, including a rapid acceleration in time to market. This quarter, Workforce Solutions launched several new products, including an expanded suite of mortgage products that provide access to richer employment and income data to customers, as well as access to pull data throughout the mortgage application life cycle and enhanced talent reports that provide a more complete view of candidate employment, income, education credentials and licenses, as well as identity validation, all critical in the hiring process. In March, as the depth of the COVID-19 pandemic initiated recession became clear, our data and analytics product and commercial teams quickly refocused their activities to work with customers and partners to leverage Equifax' unique and differentiated data assets and capabilities to support all elements of our customers operations in this challenging work environment. Central to that effort is the work number. Our unique and differentiated employment and income data asset becomes increasingly essential in this environment with unprecedented consumer income and employment dynamics from accelerating unemployment, salary reductions and furloughs in the United States. Our teams focused on how to refine existing products, as well as generate new products to utilize these differentiated capabilities to meet these new customer needs. Our data and analytics teams reacted immediately to enhance our credit trends reporting that has long been utilized by our customers to evaluate trends across consumer and commercial lending, as well as the changes in overall consumer and small business credit standing. We immediately moved from a monthly update to weekly reporting service and added more proprietary Equifax data to help customers have more real-time data to make critical decisions. This product is now available on our Ignite marketplace analytics platform. We also customize this capability for specific needs of our customers. This includes making it available over secure Ignite application that includes advanced visualization of analytics across our diverse data assets, including over 11 industry groups, eight different vantage score bands for 11 loan products with three delinquency stages across 55 states and territories, as well as over 350 metropolitan areas in the United States. In the mortgage market, we are working across the industry to utilize our data to meet the requirements for the more current employment and income data and originations using TWN and enhancing off-line analysis using - including the use of income and employment data again to help mitigate portfolio risk and help customers identify consumers that may require specific collections treatment or support. We are in discussions with customers about weekly and monthly versus quarterly or annual, portfolio reviews using our differentiated data given the rapidly changing financial condition of the consumer. We\u2019ve also launched a product we call Response Now [ph] a premium portfolio review solution across auto, credit card, personal loan and other product lines, which incorporates credit trends weekly reporting, economic data, consumer financial behavior and income and employment solutions, allowing customers to proactively manage their risk portfolio and lower credit losses while factoring in current economic - the current economic environment. These models are highly predictive and calibrated to the current economic environment to help lenders identify deteriorating credit risks. We also launched a Capital Markets Economic Suite, a suite of products to provide insight to the credit health of US consumers and small businesses, including delinquency, default and loss severity analytics for mortgage and other products, as well as the loan detail level across ZIP codes, vintages and market segments. Our ability to bring these new capabilities to market so quickly is accelerated by our progress for moving our data assets into a cloud-native data fabric. This is just the beginning of the new product and analytic offerings in front of us from our cloud data and technology investments. We will continue to prioritize and invest in new products, including recession-based product solutions during the second quarter and beyond. We recognize that Equifax - we recognize the important role that Equifax plays in the markets around the world where we do business. During this COVID-19 pandemic, we are working with consumers and other stakeholders in the public and private sectors on creative solutions that ease the burdens on consumers and businesses, while assisting in recovery efforts. In every country where we do business, Equifax is actively engaged with national and local governments to ensure continued credit reporting that captures the status of consumer payments and lender accommodations, while recognizing the intentions of policymakers to minimize negative impacts to consumers credit ratings caused by COVID-19 hardships. In the US, we worked independently and in conjunction with Experian and TransUnion to provide assistance to financial institutions seeking guidance on how to report during this challenging time period. We recognize that many consumers have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and will experience economic distress, particularly in the short term. Equifax is offering support through our website and other channels to consumers looking to minimize the pandemic\u2019s potential impact on their credit standing. Yesterday, we announced that the three US credit bureaus, Equifax, Experian and TransUnion, would be making free weekly credit reports available to all US customers, all US consumers, for one year through April 2021. We are also offering free credit reports to Canadian consumers. We encourage consumers to take advantage of ongoing educational support, regarding how credit reports and scores work. And for small businesses, we are partnering with policymakers and others to support small businesses as they navigate the current environment. I\u2019m proud of the many steps that we\u2019ve taken to support consumers and small businesses and look forward to engaging as a constructive partner to help with additional solutions to help consumers and businesses in the overall economy during this challenging time. Wrapping up, let\u2019s turn to slide 16 on the future of Equifax in 2021 and \u201822. As we battle through the economic impacts of COVID-19, we remain confident that the future of Equifax is strong. Our financial performance allows us to continue on offense and invest in our cloud transformation and new products. As we look forward to the rest of 2020 and into \u201821 and \u201822, we are confident in our business model, our investments and our ability to perform in this challenging COVID-19 economic environment. First, we have the right team in place, with seasoned leaders who understand data and analytics and how to operate in a recessionary environment. Second, our unique and differentiated data assets, including consumer credit, employment and income, utilities and property data assets, along with unique commercial credit data assets, position us to deliver the products and analytics our customers will demand as they manage through this unprecedented environment. Third, Workforce Solutions is a powerful business that we expect to grow through the COVID-19 recession and had strong growth potential in the long term. Our very unique TWN income and employment data is even more valuable in this unprecedented economic environment due to the scale, accuracy and latency of the data. EWS will continue to grow and monetize the TWN database and has real scale, with half of the US non-farm payroll in the database today, which drives hit rates and Workforce Solutions revenue. At 105 million records, the TWN database is up more than 2x from 2009, making it even more valuable than the global financial crisis many years ago. We expect TWN record growth to continue and to enhance the value of the database as hit rates continue to increase. Fourth, the momentum of the US recovery and USIS, International and GCS performance in the second half of \u201819 and the first quarter give us confidence that our businesses are competitive and well down the path of recovery [Technical Difficulty] contracts in our history from the US Social Security Administration that is expected to deliver $40 million to $50 million of revenue per year over five years, starting in 2021. This contract reinforces the unique capabilities of our TWN data assets and will deliver strong growth and margins in the future. Sixth, we are continuing to invest in new products. As you know, NPIs fuel our growth not only in the current year, but in the future. In 2019, we increased our NPI spending and delivered 90 new products. We are continuing to invest in 2020 and expect over 100 new products this year. Our NPI capabilities are being accelerated by our cloud transformation and remain a top priority for 2020 and the future. We will continue to expand our investments in new products and expect the cloud transformation to accelerate our growth from NPIs in the future. And seventh and last, we\u2019re making strong progress on our cloud transformation, and the execution of the cloud investments is a clear priority for our team in 2020. There is no change in our spending or focus on the cloud transformation. We are continuing our investments and expect to make continued progress in 2020 and be substantially complete in the North America transformation in early \u201821 with International to follow. Our new cloud-native data and applications and always-on stability and speed to market and ability to market products around the globe will deliver significant benefits to Equifax that John discussed earlier. They will enhance our competitiveness and drive our market share, new products and accelerate our revenue growth. They will reduce our technology, COGS and development expense by over 15%, delivering $125 million of savings in \u201821 and \u201822. These savings ramp through \u201821 and \u201822 and allow us to reinvest further in new products and growth, while expanding EBITDA margins. And they also reduce our capital spending to below 7% of revenue in the \u201821 and \u201822 period from the 10.5% of revenue we saw in 2019 and during the last couple of years. This is equivalent to about $115 million reduction in capital spending from 2019 levels, which provides additional cash for investments or distribution to shareholders. We believe Equifax is well positioned to weather the economic challenges with strong revenues for growth in \u201821 and \u201822. We are still working towards re-establishing our long-term financial framework and an Investor Day in the second half of 2020. Wrapping up, these are challenging and unprecedented times for everyone. None of us know the depth or duration of this economic event, but Equifax is operating well. We\u2019re prepared for the crisis, and we\u2019re well positioned to weather the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are focused on protecting the health and safety of our team, supporting consumers and delivering for our customers worldwide. We remain confident that the future of Equifax is strong. Our financial performance allows us to continue to invest in our future. Our business model is resilient, and we\u2019ve seen a strong - and we have a strong balance sheet that allows us to invest and accelerate our cloud transformation and new product investments for future growth, cost improvements, margin expansion and cash generation in \u201821 and \u201822. We hope for the continued health of our employees and the consumers, customers, partners, shareholders and all of our stakeholders. And again, we thank the health care professionals, first responders and others on the front line of this pandemic for their bravery and dedication. We will continue to be transparent with you and our investors as the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic fallout unfolds. We plan to reinstate our 2020 guidance as soon as we have more clarity on the economic impact from COVID-19 and the path to recovery. And with that operator, please open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go first to Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Andrew Steinerman : Hi. Good morning. First, I want to thank you for that slide deck. That disclosure is like industry-best. I want to go back to slide seven, when you really went over the great financial crisis [Technical Difficulty] Mark, you kind of segued to talking about you know, how EWS might do through this crisis. And my feeling is, thinking back to 2009, 2009 is really just two years after TALX [ph] was acquired in 2007. And I remember, it was benefiting - getting a lot of benefit, initial benefit from just being part of the Equifax ecosystem. And now, obviously, a decade later, that\u2019s sort of like a standard. And so I\u2019m thinking, just about Verifier, do you feel like it might just be more subject to end market volatility now than it was in 2009, just because, again, that benefit has been kind of in place for a decade now? Mark Begor : Yeah, Andrew. Thanks for the question. And you\u2019re right, the Workforce Solutions or TALX was only a couple of years into Equifax at the point and it was a different scale of the business. Their database was a fraction of the size it is today. It\u2019s 2x the scale of it. There is no question that there will be pockets in our perspective. And I think John showed you some of the trends in April, where income employment data is used in personal loans or in auto, subprime auto, where we\u2019re seeing some pressure there or declines in the recent weeks as a result of reductions in originations. There aren\u2019t many people buying cars in the last five weeks for example. But if you look at the broader perspective of the business and where income and employment data is used, we believe that the TWN data or income and employment data is more valuable today in this economic event from COVID-19 than it was in the global financial crisis. In the global financial crisis, you had unemployment levels that were quite high. We\u2019re going to have that again. But you didn\u2019t have the uncertainty around consumers that were on, furlough, that had reduced salaries. You didn\u2019t have the salary reductions that are so widespread today. And you didn\u2019t have the pace of the scale of the unemployment waves going through the economy. And what we\u2019re hearing from our customers is that the value of knowing if someone is working and the value of knowing how much they\u2019re making is more important today in this economic cycle because of the unprecedented impact on consumer\u2019s incomes in the United States is really just changes dramatically. You add to it the scale of the use of the product in mortgage, which is much larger today than it was back then, the system, the system connections that we have. We have a low interest environment today that\u2019s going to drive refis. The purchase volume, we expect to be down during the pandemic, but with low interest rate environments and stimulus will that increase in the future. And then you have the ability of the business to continue to add data records. We\u2019ve really scaled our capability to add records. And as you know, while we have hit rates that vary from 30% to 40%, we have 50%, 60%, 70% situations where we can\u2019t meet a customers request for income and employment data because our database is only 50% of non-farm payroll. So as we grow the database, the revenue in that business just grows from hit rates because of the systems impact there. So that\u2019s a bit of a long-winded discussion that - first off, we think Workforce Solutions has a really strong position in this COVID pandemic environment. And we think it has a lot of levers to continue to strengthen that position going forward. And then last, is that we really believe that if you think about data assets and value in the COVID pandemic versus the global financial crisis or prior recessions, understanding someone\u2019s income and employment is critical. I hope that helps. Andrew Steinerman : I agree. Thank you. Mark Begor : Thanks, Andrew. Operator : We'll go next to Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Andrew Jeffrey : Hi, good morning. Appreciate all the - all the detail, guys. Mark, a couple of questions for you, I guess. First, when I think about Verifier, I think you touched on it in response to Andrew\u2019s question. Could you discuss how much of the business is SMB? It seems like much of the disruption we\u2019re seeing is at that level. So I wonder if that - how much in terms of the employer business, how much you wind up capturing based on mix? Mark Begor : Do you mean on the contributor side or on the verification side, Andrew? Andrew Jeffrey : On the contributor side? Mark Begor : Yeah. Well, there is no question. You look back, I think we shared some stats back, in 2009 we had 30,000 contributors. Those were largely - primarily large businesses. And I think you know we\u2019ve had an intentional strategy of not only adding large businesses over the last decade and last year and current months, but also really getting to small businesses because that\u2019s where a lot of the workforce is. And we ended the quarter I think with 700,000 companies contributing data to us. So we\u2019re clearly getting more small businesses contributing. Where the impact of the pandemic is, it\u2019s really going to be widespread. You think about large companies, whether they\u2019re airlines or hotels or hospitality, restaurants, there is large companies out there that are furloughing lots of their employees, their executive team and very - and salaried employees are taking large salary reductions. So this is a pretty broad-based economic event. And as I discussed with Andrew, what we\u2019re hearing from our customers is that understanding the impact of forbearances and delinquencies is a challenge. And it\u2019s more challenging now than it was in the global financial crisis. But understanding, who's working? How much they're making? Has their salary been reduced? Are they on furlough at 30% reduction? Are they in a salary reduction and down 50%, is really critically important. And the pace of those changes are so rapid, meaning salary reductions happening last week. And if you think about the data assets we have and the industry has, this is the most current data asset in the industry, meaning we\u2019re updated every pay cycle. So we have data every week or two weeks from our contributors, which makes that data incredibly valuable because of its currency. So that\u2019s why that business is doing so well and why we expect it to do well in this economic environment. And we're not going to slow down our strategy around adding new records. As you know, we have a dedicated team, that\u2019s all they do, is work with big companies and payroll processors to increase our data contributors, and that\u2019s clearly a part of our strategy. You saw the growth that we had in the last year, up to 105 million records or 80 million uniques [ph] and that\u2019s going to continue. So that\u2019s another lever for that business in April and May and June and in the second half of 2020 as we continue to add data records going forward. While we\u2019re pleased we have close to half of the non-farm payroll in our database, we don't have the other half. And that\u2019s our opportunity to go work on that, which is a unique lever for growth because, as you know, the business model, the system, the system integrations, when a mortgage originator\u2019s saving our file, if they get a hit rate on our 80 million uniques, then they use that for the income and employment verification. If they don\u2019t, they have to go down another path. So every day that we\u2019re adding new records, that revenue goes up in any economic cycle as they hit our database. Andrew Jeffrey : Okay. That\u2019s all very helpful. Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up on mortgage, and I know you\u2019re not making any projections. But as you look into the back half, do you think the MBA forecast is the right way to think about your business? Mark Begor : Yeah. As you know and I\u2019ll let John jump in. We don\u2019t forecast mortgage. It\u2019s not our gig. There is others that do that quite well. We look at all the mortgage forecasts when we\u2019re doing our normal modeling, I think, as you know, and we translate that through in a pretty formulaic way into our typical forecast and guidance. And I think as John pointed out, with where the future is, it\u2019s very hard, I think even for them to forecast what\u2019s going to happen. So we\u2019re not really using that beyond \u2013 we\u2019re really focused on daily trends at this point. Andrew Jeffrey : Thank you. John Gamble : And as you know, right, between MBA, Fannie and Freddie that their forecasts are extremely divergent right now. So it\u2019s made it more difficult to rely on those. We obviously talk to them a great deal, understanding what their economists think. But as Mark said, given that no one can really forecast the economy right now, we\u2019re heavily focused on trends. Andrew Jeffrey : Right. Operator : Our next question will come from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Manav Patnaik : Well, thank you. Good morning gentlemen. My first question is to your point you just made around the wide impact of the COVID crisis with lower salaries furloughed across the board. I was just curious why you bucketed a mortgage as a recession resilient bucket. I mean, I understand the trends early on with the rate of the refis. But I\u2019m just curious how you think about how that will perform resilient and maybe compared to \u201808 or \u201809 when the new lines of between purchase in site probably? Mark Begor : Okay. I think - Manav, thanks for the question. I think we and I don\u2019t think there is any company out there that can forecast where this is going to go. How long are these lockdowns going to last? When are these going to be relaxing with economic activity? Consumers are stuck in their homes, how can they buy a car? Or how can they do a lot of financial activity? And that\u2019s why we don't see a way to forecast 2020 versus 2009. We tried to point out some of the very powerful differences in Equifax versus the global financial crisis, which we think serves us well as we enter this COVID crisis. But we don\u2019t know what the next stimulus package is going to be. We don\u2019t know what's going to happen when the payroll protection program ends in September. Is there going to be another wave of layoffs? Likely, you would think. It\u2019s hard to tell. Are people going to start flying again and going to hotels? Are they going to go to restaurants? Those things, there\u2019s so many uncertainties. So what we focused on was try to be really transparent with you, try to help you understand the significant changes in Equifax versus 2009 with Workforce Solutions up to 37% of our business and a sizable part of our EBITDA. US mortgage which we expect to continue to grow through this pandemic because of low interest rates and refis driving that and the cost actions that we\u2019ve taken. We\u2019ve tried to give you the best framework we can. And as soon as we have some visibility around where we think 2020 or 2021 is going, we\u2019ll certainly provide it. But we think we\u2019re better positioned today than we certainly were in 2009 because of the mix of our businesses. Manav Patnaik : Got it. And then just to clarify on the Employer Services business and the business tied to unemployment premiums. John, I think you mentioned you guys do 1 in 6 claims. So I was just curious, is the revenue model just simply you get paid for each claim? Or is there some other nuance? I think there's just some confusion around that? John Gamble : Sure. So the way the business model works is it\u2019s a subscription business in effect, where when people sign up for a subscription, they get a certain number of claims as part of the subscription. And then as they run through the subscription, they pay overages. So what\u2019s occurring, right, is obviously is no one anticipated this level of claims. So customers are running through their annual subscription. And then when they run through that they start to pay overages. And the reason you\u2019re seeing the revenue start to grow. But it\u2019s at a - it isn\u2019t consistent necessarily with movements in unemployment, it\u2019s because of the fact that the - that as employers run through their subscription level, then they start paying for overages based on when their subscription effectively started. So that\u2019s what you're seeing, and that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing the growth rates that we\u2019re talking about. Mark Begor : And those, John, are happening as we speak, meaning, just with the massive spike in unemployment claims coming in and off, we\u2019re certainly in revenue mode with those subscription agreements that we have. Manav Patnaik : Got it. Thank you, guys. Operator : We'll go next to George Mihalos with Cowen. Mark Begor : Good morning, George. George Mihalos : Good morning, John. Let me add my thanks for the presentation you put out this morning. I guess where I\u2019d like to start is, if we look at slide number 12, where you\u2019re talking about the 2020 April revenue trend. Like for the US business, USIS and EWS, can you maybe give us a sense of how those trends have trended throughout the month of April? Were they dramatically different last week versus, say, the first week of the month? Mark Begor : John, maybe I\u2019ll start a little bit and then maybe you can jump in. There was a difference between the last two weeks of March and as we got into April, for sure. And if you remember, the last two weeks in March, all of us were schooling up our BCP plans, going to work from home, and there just was, I think, a different level of activity with our customers and with consumers. As we got into April, if you want to call the work from home, shelter in place mode being some level of normal. It was more normal in April. But John, I don\u2019t think there was much difference outside of like unemployment claims coming in and stuff like that? John Gamble : I guess, the only thing I would add to that is it has been relatively variable, right? So we look at the trends daily. And you will see meaningful changes in any given day in the level of revenue when you look year-over-year, right? And that's why we tend to look over the longer periods. But I don't think there were any really distinct trends. Probably if you looked at USIS online mortgage, you\u2019d say it was probably somewhat trending a little bit negative. But quite honestly, we consider that in the chart that we put forward. So - but other than that, the trends, I\u2019d say the trends are a bit variable and that\u2019s quite honestly why we put a range on what we provided on slide 14, not because it\u2019s a guidance range, but because there\u2019s variability in the activity we\u2019re seeing in the month. And the only other place we\u2019re probably seeing some trends where we mentioned is seeing a little bit of a trend in the UK, it\u2019s trending negatively. And in some countries, we\u2019re seeing some stability, right? So we started to see stability in let\u2019s say, Australia. So that\u2019s been somewhat of a positive. But overall, the trends are relatively consistent, but they are highly variable in the period, although wobbling around the averages we gave. Mark Begor : I think what will be interesting is that next couple of weeks, I think as everyone is watching, you\u2019re seeing some markets start to relax the shelter in place. Chile, I think, where we have a business is starting next week. And New Zealand is starting. You see some states in the United States that are talking about relaxing that in the coming weeks. And I think that will be indicative of, you know, as we have this walk back from a shelter in place to having some levels of economic activity of what that does to our current run rates. John Gamble : The other point to make is we\u2019re clear on, right, is that International, right, the percentage of online business is just lower. So the clarity on the impact of the rates that we\u2019re giving you, the percentages we\u2019re giving you, on the entire business is less. We think what we\u2019ve done is reasonable, but the level of online reporting is just lower. George Mihalos : Understood. Understood. I appreciate that color. And then John, just two numbers questions, if I may. Just on slide 11, the $125 million of potential savings which obviously would go into EBITDA once they\u2019re consummated. Is it right to think that from an earnings perspective there will also be additional savings coming through from lower depreciation and amortization? And then, I know you\u2019re not giving guidance on slide 14, but looking at that negative $85 million to $100 million impact, is it reasonable to assume that there will be some offsets from the $90 million of annualized cost-cutting that Mark talked about earlier in the call? Thank you. John Gamble : Yeah. So just looking at slide 11, right? I mean, what we tried to do was just provide some indicative levels of dollars based on 2019 actual cost levels, since that\u2019s what we \u2013 that\u2019s the only data that we have, that\u2019s a complete year and available. So, we\u2019ve talked about this in the past, right? So the COGS savings or ex D&A, and those are things that will ramp in as we start shutting systems down, right? So, as things decommission, principally starting very late this year and then going into 2021 and then 2022, you\u2019ll see those ramp. The development expense, obviously, next year, we stop with Sierra reporting in 2021. So our development expense, you\u2019ll actually see an increase in 2021, not because the spending is higher, the spending will actually be lower. It\u2019s just because in 2020 and 2019, we were showing - we included some of this development spending in Sierra in separate recording, right, which we had separated. So, it wasn't included in our adjusted - in our adjusted EPS. So you\u2019ll see an increase in dev expense, but then as we complete the transformation, you will see the dev expense starts to decline principally as we get into 2022 and to Mark\u2019s comments. Same thing with capital, right? As you complete the US transformation, which Mark talked about completing in 2021, once that\u2019s complete, that\u2019s when you start seeing the capital reduction start to occur. So these things will phase in over time. D&A, D&A, I think we\u2019d indicated was a big step-up this year. We don\u2019t have a crystal ball into 2021. It\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll see a big reduction in 2021. You could actually see somewhat of an increase based on the spending we\u2019re seeing now. So I wouldn\u2019t expect that. But again, that - we don\u2019t have a crystal ball. That\u2019s a difficult thing at this point to forecast. In terms of near term, if you\u2019re talking about second quarter, getting some benefit from this in the second quarter, now we\u2019ve included everything that we believe that will occur in the second quarter. And it\u2019s the prior slide, which gives a view as to the impact on the transformation in 2020. And there, we\u2019re actually incurring the incremental cost of transformation because we\u2019re seeing the duplicate costs that we\u2019ve talked about in the past and that we\u2019ve shown on slide 10. So, hopefully, that covered your question. Mark Begor : John, maybe I could just add. I think the group on the call knows that up until today\u2019s call, we\u2019ve kind of talked about percentages that we see from savings from the cloud transformation. But now that we\u2019re at kind of the end of the first quarter and heading towards the last three quarters of the year, we thought it was helpful to put some dollars in of what we expect those benefits to be in \u201821 and \u201822 and going forward. George Mihalos : Thank you. Mark Begor : Thanks. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to David Togut with Evercore ISI. David Togut : Thank you. Good morning. And thanks again for the added disclosure. Mark, you called out a 500 basis point increase year-over-year in the win rate in the first quarter. Can you just elaborate a little bit on where you\u2019re seeing the biggest increases in your win rate by business segment? And at this point, do you feel that you\u2019re completely back to where you were pre-breach in terms of win rates in USIS? Mark Begor : Yeah. It\u2019s a great question. And there\u2019s clearly been momentum. We\u2019ve seen fairly steady, but there\u2019s been some bumpy sequential improvement over the last couple of years post the cyber event in 2017. And as you know, USIS was impacted most significantly. And as we got into the second half of 2019 and the first quarter, you can see the non-mortgage online responding there. The win rates have been pretty broad-based. I think you know we\u2019ve got a really strong commercially oriented leader in Sid Singh that was kind of a year and change into his role. So he\u2019s really taking hold. He\u2019s restructured the commercial organization in the last few months, and that\u2019s bringing some new energy into how they\u2019re focused in the marketplace. The new product rollouts are helpful, growing products last year, gives him more stuff to sell and his team, which I think is quite helpful. So really, there isn\u2019t a segment that stands out. We\u2019re focused on all of them. And I think you know we put a particular focus on fintech because that\u2019s a space where our competitors are much stronger than we are. We\u2019ve spooled up, I think, we\u2019ve gone probably from a year or 18 months ago from a couple of people calling on fintech to close to a dozen today that are in that space. And of course, that has historically been growing pre-COVID much more rapidly than the normal market. So it was a space that we wanted to play in. So no good answer on anything that really stands out except that there\u2019s just been a real focus around driving that. And the second half of your question is, are we back yet? The question, no, of course, USIS, our competitors pre-COVID, and I don\u2019t know what their first quarter numbers look like, but I expect their non-mortgage growth - organic growth would be higher than USIS' in the United States. So that\u2019s a growth rate we're still chasing. We still believe that our team has the potential to get back and be competitive, as exhibited by the win rates that they\u2019re having in the marketplace. And when I think about going into the COVID pandemic and the economic impacts having that momentum from USIS still in recovery mode is positive. The fact that they have had the sequential growth and the performance in the second half of \u201819 and the first quarter performance gives me confidence that they\u2019re going to react and support our customers in the marketplace. And then you couple that with having the - some of the unique data assets we have like TWN that the USIS team can sell in the marketplace, that can bundle with the existing credit file sales or other ways to go to market and bring value to our customers and using our new single data fabric with integrated solutions that combine our USIS data with our TWN data, those are more opportunities for that team to have more wins in the marketplace. David Togut : Thank you very much. John Gamble : The only thing I\u2019d throw in there is, as you know, and I\u2019m sure every business is dealing with, as we now work through April, May and June, we\u2019re evaluating the funnel very closely given the effects that are happening to our customers around - because of the pandemic, so. David Togut : Understood. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Jeff Meuler with Baird. Jeff Meuler : Yeah. Thank you. Just I wanted to talk through, I guess, the margin impacts and the cost-cutting a bit more. So what\u2019s all in the $90 million of annualized? Are you reflecting any of the benefit in the Q2 illustrative examples? And is it just like the cost actions? Or does it also include savings from things like variable compensation that might be impacted or like the higher increase? Just what\u2019s all in there? And is it impacting Q2 at all? Thanks. Mark Begor : Yeah. Like most companies, we took actions as soon as we saw the pandemic hit. As I said in my comments, we\u2019ve got a hiring freeze in place at Equifax. But that excludes where we see we need resources for the cloud transformation or for new products. So there\u2019s some benefits from that, that you expect, Jeff, would roll through. There\u2019s the travel benefits. No one\u2019s traveling. We\u2019ll -- I would guess there\u2019ll be no internal travel at Equifax for the rest of the year until there\u2019s some clarity around the vaccine and there\u2019ll be limited commercial travel. So that rolls in there. And then we also are tightening our belt around our other discretionary costs with third parties, advisers, consultants, others that are doing work that are not integral to the cloud transformation or to the - our new product rollouts. Those are areas that we\u2019re trimming back and that - John can answer the question around the framework, and I\u2019ll let John take that. John Gamble : Sure. So you also specifically mentioned variable compensation. And no, it doesn\u2019t include savings on variable compensation since the first quarter was so strong. Obviously, if that was to occur, that would be in the future. So I think Mark covered it, right? Effectively, what it is, it\u2019s the removal of any growth we had in spending in the plan that we would have shared with you back in February. And then the real reductions come in, in the reductions in discretionary spend, which we have taken some and we\u2019re continuing to work, and we\u2019ll expect to have more progress there, and then also substantial reductions in T&E. And then in terms of our employee expense, effectively, we\u2019re holding everything flat, as Mark said. So no new hiring and we\u2019ll see the benefit of attrition. But that\u2019s what's in the numbers today and that\u2019s what the second quarter reflects. And that\u2019s how we\u2019ve done our longer term scenario planning as we plan our business through the end of 2020. Beyond that, there is no incremental benefits to cost savings in the illustrative view that we provided you on slide 14. Mark Begor : Jeff, maybe I\u2019ll add one more comment. From our perspective, when you think about how we're running the company, I said in my comments quite clearly and hopefully clearly, that we\u2019re going to protect our franchise. We\u2019ve got the financial strength to continue to make strategic investments even in this challenging economic time, and that includes the cloud transformation, which John and I both said, we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019re spending what we plan to spend in 2020. And frankly, if we could find a way to accelerate the spending to accelerate the savings and benefits, we might do that. And the same with NPI. As you know, last year, we increased our spending in NPI, and that resulted in more new products. If we find opportunities to increase our spending around new products in 2020, we will do that in order to deliver in the near term you know, new products related to the recession impacts, but also for the future of Equifax. And then on the discretionary cost side, these are belt tightenings that are obviously meaningful, but are focused on areas where we won\u2019t, in my words, impact the franchise in the future of Equifax in \u201821 and \u201822. Jeff Meuler : Okay. And then I understand the subscription with overages model for the UE claims business. But can you just kind of help me better understand the timing factor? Like when do you recognize revenue relative to when the initial claim is filed? Mark Begor : Well, if they\u2019re outside of their subscription, pretty quickly. Meaning they\u2019re on the clock. That\u2019s how the economics work. John Gamble : Yeah. It's just - tactically, it\u2019s when we deliver the service, right? So when this is delivered and the claim would be filed and then the overage has occurred and we can bill for it, then the revenue would be recognized in period. Mark Begor : But we\u2019re clearly in that mode with a whole bunch of like a lot of the customers in the last couple of weeks. Jeff Meuler : Got it. Thank you, guys. Mark Begor : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Mark Begor : Hi, Bill. Bill Warmington : Good morning everyone. So first, just want to say congratulations on the Social Security contract. And I wanted to ask, when in 2021 you start generating revenue? Is that a Jan 1st start? Mark Begor : Yeah. We don\u2019t have a specific timetable for that. It\u2019s a very significant contract for us, as I mentioned. It\u2019s the largest contract in our history if we look back. It\u2019s one that really represents the power of that income and employment data that we have in EWS. And we wanted to give you some visibility as we were talking about \u201821 and \u201822, and obviously, \u201823 and \u201824, because it\u2019s a five year contract, that contract is going to be rolling in. And as we get closer to either the next few quarters or closer to our \u201821 guidance or the financial framework that we plan to put in place later in the year, we\u2019ll certainly give you more specifics on that. Bill Warmington : Okay. And then for my follow-up, I was going to ask if you could put some numbers around what you\u2019re seeing in terms of volume originations for credit card, for auto and for insurance. And it would also be helpful in terms of doing our modeling if you could get a sense of what that represents as a percentage of total Equifax revenue? Mark Begor : Yeah. John, you\u2019re going to have to help me on that one. I don\u2019t know if we have handy that kind of data. I think you probably know that when it comes to cards and P loans, we\u2019re smaller than our competitors in the United States in that space. They\u2019re much larger than we are. And we\u2019ve clearly globally seen the largest impacts in cards, P loans and auto, just because it\u2019s common sense, right? If consumers can\u2019t get out of their homes, they can\u2019t go to a car dealership and buy a car and then they can\u2019t use the financing on it. So there\u2019s clearly been impacts in every market in those spaces. John, would you add to that in any way? John Gamble : No. I just \u2013 I\u2019d say, I think we gave quite good detail on non-mortgage in total, but, no, we haven\u2019t broken it down for everybody by line of business. So I think that\u2019s a level of granularity we\u2019re going to hold back on. We\u2019re okay where we are. Mark Begor : I think maybe just - as you might imagine, what we are seeing is that the customers we deal with have pulled back on prescreens or originations. They\u2019re raising risk scores because of the uncertainty around the consumer, which impacts their volume. And as I mentioned in my comments, you may recall that I was running GE Capital\u2019s credit card business, which is now Synchrony, back in 2009 and those are the actions we took. Until you have some clarity around the consumer in those kind of businesses, whether it\u2019s P loan, auto or cards, you\u2019re going to be more conservative on your originations. On the flip side of that is, as I mentioned, which is the beauty of the business that we\u2019re in, is the countercyclical side is in my experience, we spent more money on portfolio management and credit line increase and decrease actions in order to manage the existing book that you have because the consumer is changing so rapidly. And one area we see that we\u2019re seeing some real traction on is increased discussions and activity around our income and employment data from Workforce Solutions in some of those spaces where we historically had less penetration or market share. Bill Warmington : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Andrew Nicholas : Hi, good morning. You talked quite a bit about the new product enhancements you\u2019ve rolled out to address the recessionary environment, many of which seem to prioritize more frequent data updates. Do you think demand for this level of frequency could persist coming out of the crisis? And then maybe relatedly are there any other changes to customer behavior that you've seen that you think could have a more lasting impact on the demand side? Mark Begor : Yeah. I think it\u2019s really tough to predict what's going to happen because we\u2019ve never seen anything like this and there\u2019s so many uncertainties about how is the consumer going to come back? What's the stimulus going to look like? Is there going to be a second wave after the payroll protection plans here in the United States of unemployment action? So you have all those things layered in there which really impact how long this cycle is going to be and how much stimulus is going to be put at it. Clearly, we\u2019ve seen unprecedented amounts that will be helpful. But the depth of this one, when you think about travel and the impacts from unemployment in so many sectors is just massive. Whether it will persist on the frequency post this economic event, hard to predict, I do expect the frequency of refreshing your data, refreshing your portfolio to be much more in this economic event than it was in 2009, just because there\u2019s so many more uncertainties in this environment. The second thing I would say that I mentioned earlier in my comments that I think is going to be uniquely valuable for Equifax is income and employment data, who\u2019 working and who\u2019s not, is going to be - we didn\u2019t have the database and the scale that we had in 2009 [ph]. We do today, but the volatility of people\u2019s salaries and ability to repay their debt is so much different in this economic environment than last one. And then to your point, does that result in work number or our TWN income and employment data becoming more of the workflows going forward? I think it\u2019s really possible. And we\u2019re opportunistically trying to work on that. When you think about mortgage, every mortgage in the United States that\u2019s originated for the most part pulls all three credit files and most - and they all have to really verify income and employment. We\u2019re very integrated in that workflow, but we still have more opportunities for system to system integration. We don\u2019t have - we only have - I say only, we only have half of the non-farm payroll. So there is a 50% of the originations or whatever the percentage is, something like that, that have to be verified in another way. So we\u2019ll be able to grow going in that space. We don't have that same penetration in some of the other sectors. And this could result in an extended period for Workforce Solutions to increase its market share in some of those other spaces like auto, like P loans and like cards, which we\u2019ve been working on pre-pandemic and we\u2019re really spooling up now. Andrew Nicholas : Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then one quick one. As the Workforce Solutions business mix potentially stabilizes a bit this year with a faster growing Employer Services business, could you refresh us on the margin profile of the Verification Employer Services businesses? Just trying to gain appreciation for how a stronger Employer Services business might impact margin expansion trends over the next handful of quarters? Thanks. Mark Begor : John, maybe you could take that one. John Gamble : Yes. So we haven't given specific margin differences. What we have said is that Verification Services looks somewhat like the online portions of USIS, somewhat lower, right, because they have some royalty payments that are larger than what USIS might pay and that Employer Services is quite a bit below that, okay? But we haven't actually given a specific breakdown. Although given the detail we gave on split of revenue and then total margin for the BU, I think you can probably get pretty close. Mark Begor : John, I think it\u2019s safe to say that the incremental margins on this incremental unemployment claim volume is quite high. John Gamble : It is. It is. Not quite the size of verification, but it\u2019s high. It is relatively high, yeah. Andrew Nicholas : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America. Gary Bisbee : Hi, guys. Good morning. I guess, two part question. First, on your Employer services - I'm sorry, Workforce Solutions business, how do we think about the 22 million jobs lost in the last couple of weeks on the record? How does that - you talked about continuing to grow records, but it would take the active records go down as people lose their jobs. How does that flow through to revenue? Mark Begor : Well, there will clearly be some impact there. We don\u2019 process all unemployment claims. We pick up that data which is valuable on the claims that we do process. So there could be some impact, but I think it\u2019s quite minimal. John? John Gamble : Yeah. So I mean, effectively, the dynamic that's occurring, right, is that as we get payroll files to the extent that we have a given employer that has done a layoff so that the employment is much lower, which I think is what you\u2019re referring to, then, yes, work number records would decline. What\u2019s been offsetting that, right, I mean, certainly, year-on-year, but also continuing through this quarter - sorry, last quarter in the first quarter is there was a substantial increase in the number of subscribers starting really, as we talked about kind of September through the end of last year and a very large increase in records. So what you\u2019re looking at is very large increases in records year-on-year and absolutely some offset from unemployment increasing once individuals become unemployed. And I think the dynamic that's benefiting us is the year-over-year benefit we have from what I just referenced and then also the continued work that the team is doing to add new contributors at a relatively rapid pace. So as we go through this year, we\u2019ll have to see how those two dynamics play out in terms of our ability to add new contributors and then also the negative effect, which is - which as our contributors have lower employee bases that you see our - that impact the record base. But so far, because of the large additions in new contributors we\u2019ve seen over the past five plus six to seven months that continues to be a net positive. As we go through the year, we\u2019ll keep you up-to-date on what it looks like. Mark Begor : And maybe, John, just to add to that, as you probably know or you may know, we sell various flavors of our Workforce Solutions TWN data. We sell system to system integration if the consumer\u2019s going through a mortgage process and the originator hits our file, if there\u2019s a consumer in that file, then they pull that record in the - we charge them for it, whether they\u2019re working today or they were working six months ago, nine months ago, 12 months ago, et cetera, dependent upon the product that they pull in. We also \u2013 there\u2019s applications or customer use cases where so-called inactive records, meaning someone was working or on our database a year ago or six months ago or two months ago and is not active today is another revenue source for us that we sell. So there\u2019s multiple ways that we're able to sell the data, including the active records. Gary Bisbee : Okay. Great. And then just a quick follow-up. We\u2019ve seen a number of reports out there about tighter bank underwriting standards beginning to impact refinancing volumes and potentially consumer lending more broadly. Have you - are you seeing that in the data? Is that incorporated at all in the mortgage strength that\u2019s implied by that April trend data? Thank you. Mark Begor : I think it\u2019s hard for us to see that in mortgage because that\u2019s - mortgage is fairly strong, both in the credit file in USIS and then with the verification and Workforce Solutions. I think, as John pointed out, in USIS, our non-mortgage volume is, obviously, trends are down versus first quarter and last year. And those are going to reflect things like auto and P loans and credit cards, and it\u2019s going to be a combination. It\u2019s going to be primarily of them reducing originations. Part of it is just from economic activity or foot traffic, meaning with people in shelter in place, you can't buy a car. Or you can, but it\u2019s not as much happening. And then some of it is going to be, as you described of lenders, which some I\u2019ve talked to, and I know that's what I did in 2009, when I was running GE Capital's business, you tighten up originations, so you figure out where that - where the consumer is going to be. So you raise score cut-offs or different ways to make sure you\u2019re protecting your book while you\u2019re still doing some originations. But we\u2019ve clearly seen declines in those markets, not only in the United States but in other markets around the globe. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Brett Huff with Stephens Incorporated. Brett Huff : Good morning, and thanks for the exit rate data, guys. I hope you\u2019re all doing well. A couple of questions from me. I\u2019m looking back at my model, and I think you guys bottomed out in the USIS online about minus 13% in one of the quarters in \u201809, if I'm remembering right. And I think you said you\u2019re seeing about minus 30% now. I\u2019m just wondering kind of the compare contrast between those two numbers, if I\u2019ve got those right. What\u2019s different and what\u2019s similar between those two, and why more today? Mark Begor : Well, there\u2019s nothing similar about 2009. There is but I\u2019m being a little sharp on that. This is so different. In 2009 there wasn\u2019t shelter in place and there wasn\u2019t every retail operation, auto dealers, you name it, shut down for months at a time. That\u2019s dramatically different, just the economic activity. And as I mentioned earlier, as we\u2019re starting to see some relaxation in states like here in Georgia, they\u2019re going to allow restaurants to open in a week or two and things like that. That to me is what is one point that\u2019s just dramatically different and you really can't compare how we performed until we get back to what I would call normal economic activity, meaning consumers are allowed to go to stores and want to go to stores and so on. Even with that, it's my view that this is going to be dramatically different than 2009 from an economic standpoint, just because of how consumers are going to operate. Are they going to go on a plane on vacation? That drives economic activity and credit cards. Are they going to put off buying a new car? The waves of unemployment are very different now than they were in 2009, and we\u2019ve never seen, in our lifetimes, the waves of furloughs or salary reductions. It\u2019s just never been at that scale, which obviously changes how the consumer is operating and can operate. So that\u2019s just dramatically different. Now why we thought it was important to share that with you of what we looked like in 2009 was not about the specific percentages, but really how our - the resiliency of our business is, and we try to give you our view of how we categorize the businesses and a business like Workforce Solutions powered through the 2009 crisis is currently powering through the COVID crisis. We expect that to continue. The same with US mortgage. With low interest rates, us being over-indexed to mortgage in the United States is a good thing. It\u2019s generating margin that we can use to reinvest in the business as that business goes forward. So I think there is more differences in similarities, but the difference is around the scale of our recession-resistant businesses being dramatically larger in this economic event versus 2009, which was the worst we\u2019ve ever seen until now, I think, serves us well as we get deeper into this COVID economic recession. Brett Huff : Okay\u2026 John Gamble : Sorry, just for clarity, we said non-mortgage is down 30% online. Total online, we said down just over 10%. I just wanted to make sure you\u2019re comparing the right numbers, that\u2019s all. Brett Huff : Got you. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then the second question is, John, you mentioned kind of having the online kind of daily tally, if you will. Do you have any insight into the credit files that are being pulled or the data that\u2019s being used, kind of what use cases are being more or less impacted? And I\u2019m thinking sort of the difference between maybe marketing, credit offers versus originating credit offers versus doing kind of portfolio management type stuff. Any sort of hints in the data on that? Or is that too opaque still? John Gamble : So for us, most, not all, marketing and portfolio management would be batched. So that would be an FMS. And that\u2019s a place where we would have less visibility now, I think, as you mentioned in the call, because that batch business tends to happen for end of periods and it isn\u2019t really as subject to reliable trends. So we\u2019ve made assumptions about what will happen there, but they are far less based on trends. And they are based on the trends we're seeing in online. Within online, we do know by general industry type. And I think there is some detail within industry type deeper than that. But in terms of a specific use case within a lender, no, not so much, right. So for example, if someone pulls a mortgage file, we\u2019ll certainly know who hold it. But we don\u2019t necessarily know if it's for a refi or not or we don\u2019t - or versus a new purchase or in some cases it\u2019s difficult to tell if it's even for HELOC [ph]. Brett Huff : Great. Understood. Thanks, guys. John Gamble : Thanks. Operator : And now I would like to turn the call over to Jeffrey Dodge. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Dodge : Okay. That will conclude our call for today. I appreciate everybody\u2019s time. I know the call went a little bit longer than normal, but again, refer you to the material that is on our website. And with that, operator, we will conclude our call. Thanks, everybody. Operator : That does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.+",

At this time, I would like to now turn the conference over to Jeff Dodge. Please go ahead, sir. Jeff Dodge : Thanks and good morning, everyone. Welcome to today\u2019s conference call. I\u2019m Jeff Dodge and with me are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer; and Trevor Burns with Investor Relations. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com. During the call today, we will be making reference to certain materials that can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website under Earnings Calls, Presentations and Webcasts. These materials are labeled Q2 2020 Earnings Release Presentation. During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2019 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. Also, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our website. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark. Mark Begor : Thank you, Jeff and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining our second quarter earnings update. Businesses and consumers around the world continue to face challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. I hope you and your families are continuing to be safe in managing in this unusual environment. We'd like to once again thank the dedicated and selfless healthcare professionals, first responders, volunteers, and others around the world who are on the frontline fighting this pandemic, and we sympathize with the millions of people in the U.S. and around the world that are been affected. The health impact of the COVID pandemic is devastating, but what is equally challenging to our customers is the unprecedented impact from the COVID pandemic. It is unlike anything in our lifetimes with record unemployment, furloughs, and salary reductions. Data and analytics in this environment is more valuable than ever. During the second quarter, we operated very effectively in our work-from-home mode after COVID restrictions were put in place in late March. After a shelter-in-place orders started to lift in early June, we opened up our offices in markets like Atlanta and began to return to office on a 50% density in Red-Blue team rotational basis. Currently, we have 34 of 51 offices opened and are operating in that mode. We expect to stay in stay in the 50% density in our Red-Blue rotation mode until a vaccine is available. We are operating at a very high level and have realized meaningful productivity and engagement with customers and across our Equifax team through video collaboration, including meeting all of our cloud technology and data transformation milestones. Turning now to slide four, our financial results for the second quarter were very strong and our second consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion driven by Workforce Solutions, U.S. mortgage market, and our positive performance in the marketplace. The results follow our momentum in the second half of 2019 and the strong first quarter and were well above our expectations. Our performance in the challenging COVID economic environment reflects the strength and resiliency of our business model, our differentiated data assets, including the TWN income and employment data, health care utility and commercial data, and the value of data analytics in the unprecedented times. Revenue at $983 million was up 12% on a reported basis and 13% on a local and organic local currency basis, which is well above our expectations and above the framework of 3.5% to 5.5% that we shared with you in early June. If you adjust for the $48 million of incremental Workforce Solution\u2019s unemployment claims revenue in the quarter, our revenue increased a strong 8% in local currency. As the quarter unfolded in June, our revenue on all fronts continue to improve from the trends we shared on the June 8th call as shelter in place orders lifted and economic activity improved. These strong results position us well as we move into third quarter in the second half. Our growth in the quarter was powered by our U.S. B2B businesses, USIS and Workforce Solutions. They both performed extremely well with combined U.S. revenue up 28% and a combined adjusted EBITDA margins of over 50%. Workforce Solutions revenue was exceptionally strong, up 53%; and EBITDA margins were 56%, which was their strongest quarterly results since the acquisition almost 13 years ago and followed strong first quarter and second half of 2019. USIS revenue was up a strong 10%, which reinforced their return to a competitive market position. International revenue was down 15% in local currency but continue to show broad-based sequential improvement throughout the quarter. And global consumer revenue was down just under 5%, principally in our U.S. partner business. The revenue growth drove adjusted EBITDA of $353 million, up 19%, with an over 200 basis point expansion in our adjusted EBITDA margin to 35.9% as we balance cost controls while executing our cloud data and technology transformation and making targeted investments in new products and data and analytics. Adjusted EPS of $1.60 a share was up over 14% despite incurring increased data analytics and incremental cloud costs of $0.12 per share and increased interest expense of $0.06 per share for our April bond offering. EBITDA and EPS were both above our expectations and EPS framework of $1.22 to $1.32 we shared with you in early June. The very strong U.S. B2B revenue growth was driven principally by three factors; first, U.S. mortgage revenue was up over 70% versus 2019, was extremely strong in the current record low interest rate environment as Equifax outperformed the overall mortgage market growth on the order of 30 percentage points, principally in Workforce Solutions. As you know, we over-indexed in mortgage versus our competitors due to Workforce Solutions in our U.S. tribe your mortgage business. U.S. mortgage market inquiries, our proxy for the overall mortgage market growth, were up 41% in second quarter versus our 70% combined growth in Workforce Solutions and USIS mortgage. Although USIS mortgage revenue growth of 44% grew 30 -- 300 basis points above the mortgage market, the driver of the substantial outperformance versus the overall market was Workforce Solutions, where mortgage revenue more than doubled in the quarter, driven by the value of our unique twin income and employment data and new products, new customers, improved customer penetration and the expansion of our twin database. We expect continued strong mortgage growth in the third quarter. Second, our unemployment insurance claims business also part of Workforce Solutions, delivered more than 150% growth in the quarter to $76 million. Incremental revenue growth of $43 million in the quarter was driven by a significant increase in unemployment claims that we all know about during the second quarter, which added 5 percentage points to overall Equifax revenue growth. As you know, Workforce Solutions processes close one in five unemployment claims in the U.S. We expect unemployment claims to continue above 2019 levels in the third quarter, but at a rate below the second quarter. Third, our U.S. B2B non-mortgage revenue, excluding unemployment insurance claims-based revenue, showed substantial improvement as we move through the second quarter and was down only about 7%. Our U.S. B2B non-mortgage revenue, excluding U.S. UC claims impact showed sequential improvements during the quarter, from down 10% in April to down just 2% in June, as shelter-in-place restrictions were lifted and economic activity improved, which reflects our competitive market position and provides good momentum going in the third quarter. I'll provide more detail on these factors as we discuss each of our business units on slide five. Starting with USIS, their revenue was $366 million, was up 10% in the second quarter on a reported and organic basis, and their 12% first half revenue growth was their strongest 2014. Mortgage revenue grew 44%, 300 basis points faster than the overall market inquiries that were up 41%, driven by new products, new customers, and pricing. Total mortgage revenue growth from both purchase and refi transactions strengthened significantly through the quarter, exiting June at over 60% above 2019. Total non-mortgage revenue, online and offline combined decreased 7%, much better than expected when we entered the quarter at down 13% in April. In total, non-mortgage revenue was down only 1% in June as economic activity improved sequentially during the quarter, which is above our expectations and a reflection of the USIS competitive position in the marketplace. For the quarter, online revenue was up 7%. Online non-mortgage revenue was down 10% in the quarter, but strengthened significantly during the second quarter, with June just down over 2% versus down 17% in April. In June, we had positive growth in auto, insurance, ID and fraud, and direct-to-consumer, with commercial declining high single-digits as U.S. economic activity improved. Telco and banking were both down mid-single-digits in June and showed improvement during the quarter. Banking remains down as customer marketing continues to be at a reduced level until the direction of the economy and the consumer becomes clear. Mortgage solutions, our mortgage and tribal business was up 44% in the quarter, outgrowing market by 300 basis points from new products, new customers, and pricing. Financial marketing services revenue was up 1% compared to last year and better than our expectations. Risk decisioning, which includes portfolio review revenue and makes up over 30% of total financial marketing services was up over 15% in second quarter as companies expanded their portfolio review activities. Marketing revenue, which also makes up about half of FMS in the quarter, was down just under 20%. The remainder of FMS, which includes our ID and collections products, was up over 25% in the quarter. These general trends are consistent with our expectations; however, portfolio review revenue was stronger than expected. We expect portfolio review activity to remain strong as customers manage challenging customer collections and take proactive portfolio management actions. We are also starting to see increased activity from customers for our marketing services at quarter ended, although at much lower levels than 2019. USIS is winning competitively and continues to accelerate commercial activity, and their new deal pipeline remains strong. USIS' new deal pipeline opportunities as of the end of June was at their largest level since 2017, up almost 10% over last year. Equally positive, USIS\u2019s win rates in the quarter were up quarter were up over 300 basis points from last year. USIS\u2019s new deal pipeline growth and win rates were both above our expectations and reflect fitting's commercial focus in leadership as USIS returns to market competitiveness. USIS\u2019s adjusted EBITDA margins of 44.1% were down 150 basis points from last year and 60 -- and down 60 basis points sequentially. The decline is principally driven by the higher mix of lower margin mortgage revenue, and resulting higher royalty costs and data purchases bandwidth our non-mortgage online revenue. USIS also continued to invest in commercial resources and NPI resources during the quarter for future growth. Following USIS\u2019s commercial momentum in the second half of 2019 and strong above-expectation results in first and second quarter, we are confident that fitting leadership has moved USIS back into a competitive position in the U.S. market. Shifting to Workforce Solutions. They had another exceptional quarter with revenue of $353 million, up 53%. This is the strongest revenue growth since we acquired TALX in 2007. EWS results were up a strong 33%, excluding the $48 million of incremental UC claims revenue in the quarter. Trailing 12 months revenue was $1.15 billion, up 32%, with 49.6% EBITDA margins up 350 basis points. Rudy Ploder and his EWS team gave you a deep dive on our EWS business and growth outlook in early June. They continue to leverage core growth, new products, penetration, pricing, new verticals and record additions to fuel their growth. EWS is on track to be well over $1 billion of revenue in 2020 for the first time, with 50% plus margins. Workforce Solutions is clearly our strongest business, particularly in this unprecedented consumer environment, where TWN income and employment data is immensely valuable. Verification Services revenue of $252 million was up 46% versus 2019. Verification Services mortgage revenue more than doubled in the quarter, growing more than 60 percentage points faster than the 41% growth we saw in the mortgage market credit inquiries in the quarter. This dramatic outperformance relative to the overall mortgage market is driven by the strategic and operational focus on new products, penetration, usage and record additions that we discussed on our June investor call. As a reminder, the presentation from our June call is available on the Equifax website. Several growth levers are driving this outperformance of Verification Services mortgage revenue relative to the overall mortgage market, including growth in TWN contributor and records. During the quarter, the number of companies contributing to the TWN database increased substantially to over 900,000 from over 700,000 in March and 37,000 a year ago as we expand into more mid- and smaller market companies. Due to this growth in new contributors, Workforce Solutions was able to offset the negative impact on active TWN records of increasing unemployment. Total active records were 105 million at the end of the quarter, with over 80 million unique individuals, which is just over 50% of the U.S. non-farm payroll. Total active records were up over 15% from a year ago, but flat with March due to impacts on the database from unemployment. The TWN database now includes about 435 million active and inactive records. And as you know, we are able to monetize both active and inactive TWN records. In addition to growth in employer contributors and overall TWN records and a focus on adding new customers, several new critical strategies are an important component of driving the verification service mortgage revenue growth in excess of the overall mortgage market. First, direct-to-consumer integrations with mortgage underwriters continue to grow with the work number integrated directly into our customers' underwriting processes. These integrations increased the usage of TWN records and the frequency of TWN polls in the mortgage origination, underwriting, and closing process, which drives TWN verification revenue. Second, new products focused on increasing the number of times of TWN income and employment verification is used during the mortgage application approval process. We shared some of the new solutions we are bringing to marketplace that drive TWN usage and provide value to our customers with you in the June call, and many of these products have pricing that is two to four times our based TWN full product cost. Number three, expanding real-time access to additional income sources to include the increasing number of people that work as individual contractors or 1099 self-employed consumers to deepen and broaden the TWN database beyond non-payroll. Shifting to Verification Services non-mortgage revenue growth, it was down less than 5% in second quarter and delivered 2% growth in June. The decline in the quarter was driven by substantial weakness in talent solutions, our hiring rate services business, to where companies across the U.S. cutback on hiring in during the quarter, and in debt management services where temporary reductions in collections activity were implemented by many companies. Partially offsetting this were new product rollouts in talent solutions, strength in government verticals related to government healthcare and support services, as well as the growth in records in the TWN database. We also saw growth in the second quarter in auto through increased TWN penetration with auto loan originators and increased use of TWN with higher credit score applicants. We also saw growth in our TWN ID product and in portfolio review product solutions, principally for card and personal loans, which we expect to continue to grow in the second half given the unique value of income and employment data in the current environment. Employer Services revenue of $101 million increased a strong 75% in the quarter, driven by our unemployment claims business, which grew over 150% versus last year to $76 million. Adjusting for the $48 million of incremental UC claims revenue in the quarter, Employer Service was down about 8% as companies cut back on hiring. As a reminder, our UC businesses manage the process of providing the required unemployment data to state and local agency for employers. Our typical contract is an annual subscription with volume limits and incremental fees as UC claims are above those above those ones. We operate in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands. In the second quarter, Workforce Solutions processed about 7.5 million claims, which is roughly one in five initial U.S. claims during the second quarter. Claims spiked in April and May to about 5.8 million from a monthly run rate of $300,000 per month in the first quarter. In June, we saw a steady decline in new clients from the elevated April and May rates to 1.7 million claims processed for the month, which was still up dramatically over pre-COVID in 2019 levels. The remainder of Employer Services saw revenue decline 17% in the second quarter because of lower new employee hiring activity in the quarter. I-9 and onboarding in our Workforce Analytics business make up the bulk of the remainder of Employer Services. We saw 9% growth in our I-9 and onboarding business, which partially offset the decline in Workforce Analytics in our Tax Services business. The strong EWS verifier revenue growth resulted in adjusted EBITDA margins of 56.3% in the quarter, which was a record for Workforce Solutions and the expansion of 710 basis points versus last year. The strong margin growth was partially offset by incremental costs incurred in the quarter for new TWN records. Workforce Solutions is clearly our most differentiated business with their unique TWN income and employment records. The TWN data assets are increasingly valuable in this COVID consumer environment where verification of income and employment is critical. As we discussed in June, we think about EWS being in the second or third inning, with multiple growth levers for future growth in 2021 and beyond. International revenue of $181 million was down 15% in local currency and down 21% on a reported basis and in line with our expectations. COVID shelter in place orders have been deeper and longer in our international markets, with some markets, including Australia, the U.K. and Canada, still not open. This has impacted their revenue, but we've seen sequential revenue improvements from down 20% in April, improving to down 7% in June. Asia Pacific, which is our Australia, New Zealand and India business delivered second quarter revenue of $65 million, down 9% in local, and 10% in organic local currency versus last year. The revenue growth was much stronger than the revenue trends of down 20% we experienced in April as revenue trends continued to improve, with June down 4%, adjusted for a large collections deal that closed late in the second quarter. In Australia, revenue growth in fraud and ID and collections partially offset declines in our consumer and marketing services businesses, and to a lesser degree, in our commercial business. European revenues of $48 million were down 25% in local currency in the quarter. Our European credit business was down about 20%, with Spain performing slightly better than the U.K. In the U.K. credit business, revenue improved meaningfully during the quarter from down 27% in April, but they were still down 15% in June as the U.K. is still in a lockdown. Spain credit revenue also improved during the quarter from down 21% in April, but was still down 9% in June as shelter in place orders have just begun to be lifted a few weeks ago. Our European debt management business declined 34% in local currency, as expected, principally driven by government enacted policy that temporarily halted consumer debt collections. We expect debt collection activity to resume in the second half. Our Latin American revenues of $34 million decreased 14% in local currency in the quarter. Our two largest markets in Latin America, Chile and Argentina, make up over 50% of the revenue. Importantly, these two markets performed relatively well in the quarter, with Chile down six and Argentina down 10 in local currency compared to last year. April revenue decline for Chile and Argentina were elevated levels in COVID lockdowns, however, June revenue declines were in the low to mid-single digits. These markets continue to benefit from the expansion of Ignite and InterConnect SaaS customer rollouts and strong new product introductions in the past three years. Most of our other Latin American markets were down over 20% consistently through the quarter from the economic impact of the strong COVID lockdowns in those markets. Canada revenue of $33 million declined 13% in local currency in the second quarter. Revenue improved from a decline of about 25% in April to down only about 1% in June as economic activity improved. But shelter-in-place orders still have not been fully lifted in many parts of Canada. Fraud and ID revenue grew in the second quarter from higher government volumes associated with increased applications for government and social services. And we saw growth in June revenue in our mortgage, auto, and small business verticals in Canada. International adjusted EBITDA margins of 21.7% were down 690 basis points from last year, principally reflecting the lower revenue across all regions, partially offset by cost savings achieved during the quarter. Global Consumer Solutions revenue was down 5% on a reported and local currency basis in the quarter. Our Global Consumer Direct business, which is just under half of our GCS business, was down about 3%. Our U.S. Consumer Direct business had revenue declining about 5% versus 2019, but increased sequentially from the first quarter by about 200 basis points. Canada and the U.K. combined consumer direct revenue was about flat in the quarter. Importantly, we are seeing substantial subscriber growth in the U.S. and Canada, our two largest markets. Based on a continuation of these trends, we expect our consumer direct business to show positive revenue growth in the second half, which will be our first growth since 2017 in this market segment. GCS also continues to grow with myEquifax member base with over 6 million consumer members, up from about 2 million a year ago, which provides a foundation for new product offerings. Our remaining GCS business, principally our partner business as well as our benefits channel and event-based business decreased by 5% in the quarter. We delivered high-single-digit growth in our benefits channel and events-based business, but this growth was more than offset by declines in our U.S. Lead Gen partner business as banks pulled back on card and P loan marketing and originations. As we look to the second half of 2020, declines in our U.S. Lead Gen partner revenue are likely to accelerate as consumer marketing remains at reduced levels more than offsetting the expected growth in Global Consumer Direct, our benefits channel, and events-based business. This will likely result in second half revenue decline in GCS greater than the 5% decline we delivered in the second quarter. GCS adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.8% decreased 210 basis points compared with the prior year due to the effect of revenue decline, partially offset by operating cost efficiencies. In what has been the most challenging economics and health environment we faced in our lifetime, Equifax delivered a very strong performance, with revenue up 12% and adjusted EBITDA -- EPS up 14% in the first half. Our resilient business model, differentiated data assets, cloud data and technology transformation, new products, and focus on commercial execution, has driven our broad outperformance. Our U.S. B2B businesses, USIS, and EWS, delivered mortgage revenue growth that outperformed the overall mortgage market, substantial growth in our UC revenue, and improving revenue trends across our non-mortgage businesses, the U.S. and international, drove our results. Shifting now to slide six, this page highlights the uniqueness and challenges of the current COVID recession. It is clear that this is the most challenging consumer environment in our lifetime. Compared to the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, unemployment rates are up almost 500 basis points with over 20 million Americans out of work. And for the 10% of Americans with negative wage impacts where wages are down 5% to 6%, with many households struggling to manage 25% or more salary reductions or even larger if they're in a furlough. These unprecedented consumer impacts significantly cloud the ability for our customers to manage their business, including marketing, underwriting, and portfolio management. We've seen a significant performance deterioration of prime and near-prime credit portfolio, driven by these job losses and wage reductions. Many project a continuation in job losses or wage reductions as government support programs expire in the coming weeks. In April of this year, approximately 50% of those who suffered a decrease in pay in excess of 25% were individuals with a credit score of 680 or higher, which further complicates the environment for our customers. Forbearances are also driving material loss of predictiveness of traditional credit scores in the sub-prime market. And further, the CARES Act -- with the CARES Act, loan accommodation PE delinquency rates artificially low and make them not representative of the actual portfolio health. Accommodations have grown from 2.8% pre-COVID in March to 9% of balances today. In these challenging times, differentiated data is more valuable than ever. We're seeing a meaningful increase in customer discussions in this unique environment about data solutions broadly, but with a particular focus on our unique TWN income and employment data, which is sourced every paper. Turning now to slide 7. We updated the comparison of our performance in the current COVID pandemic driven recession to our performance in the 2008-2009 global financial crises. Based on the growth of Workforce Solutions and our U.S. mortgage business, we are seeing significantly stronger performance in the current COVID recession, with our 13% revenue growth in the second quarter, and in the early stages of the 2008 and 2009 global financial crisis where Equifax revenue was down 7% to 10% quarterly during that recession. The key drivers of our strong outperformance relative to 2008-2009 include a resilient business model and stronger mix of businesses, with 50% -- 55% of Equifax delivering growth or countercyclical performance in 2020 versus only 40% in 2008-2009. Second, U.S. mortgage revenue is at very high levels with refi and purchase transactions continuing historic levels driven by record low interest rates. We saw mortgage application purchase volume rebound as we exited second quarter as consumers take advantage of record low interest rates. The MBA application purchase index was up 15% versus 2019 in the last week of June. This strength continued into July. Based on current rates, over 15 million existing mortgages would benefit from the refinancing, which is up about 70% higher than the available refi population in 2008-2009, John will give you some further perspective on the second half U.S. mortgage market outlook shortly. Mortgage is clearly much stronger today with revenue in the second quarter for Equifax up over 70%, which is significantly higher than the 20% peak revenue growth we delivered during 2008-2009. Third, Workforce Solutions growth has been accelerated from record growth penetration, new products and new verticals. Their 53% growth in second quarter significantly outperformed their peak quarterly growth performance of about 20% in the 2008-2009 global financial crises. In addition to growth in verifications of 46%, the unemployment claims processing business is seeing record volumes, resulting in the $48 million of incremental UC revenue in the second quarter I talked about earlier. Then last, our commercial momentum from the second half of 2019 and strong first quarter performance as we entered the COVID environment in late March, is clearly also driving our results. The Equifax business model and recession resiliency is clearly much stronger than the last recession in 2008-2009. I'll turn the discussion over to John to discuss recent trends in revenue and our underlying markets, as well as review some of our other financial items. But looking at trends at a high level, USIS and Workforce Solutions mortgage revenue continues to be very strong and relatively stable at the elevated levels we saw in June. While we expect mortgage revenue growth rates on a year-over-year basis to remain strong in the second quarter, we do expect growth rates in the third quarter and second quarter to decline versus second quarter as we saw growth -- strong growth in mortgage markets in the second half of 2019. In USIS, the improvement in non-mortgage revenue has flattened over the past few weeks after consistent sequential improvement throughout the second quarter. And in some markets and verticals, we've started to see some slight declines in the last few weeks as COVID case counts increase and some shelter-in-place orders return. In Workforce Solutions, Verification Services trends in non-mortgage revenue remains slightly positive to prior trends, driven by the strategic dynamics of the business and new products rollouts, as we discussed earlier. Workforce Solutions unemployment insurance claims revenue remains at elevated levels at a run rate of over $40 million for the quarter, which is, while positive over 2019, will be substantially lower than the employment claims, we expect to be substantially lower than the unemployment claims volume we saw in the second quarter. And given the continued uncertainty regarding the direction and pace of the U.S. and global economy, we do not expect to provide guidance throughout the remainder of 2020. As we did last quarter and in June, we'll provide details on the trends we are seeing in an indicative view of their implications. After John's discussion, I'll come back and review our progress on the technology transformation, new products, and our focus on the second half in 2021. John? John Gamble : Thanks Mark. I will generally be referring to the results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis and on a non-GAAP basis. In the second quarter, general corporate expenses was $122 million, excluding non-recurring costs. Adjusted general corporate expense for the quarter was $75 million, up $8 million from Q2 2019. Corporate functional expenses, such as finance, HR, and legal are down year-to-year, reflecting the cost containment activity Mark discussed in April. The increase in total general corporate expense is primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs in 2020 due to the very strong financial performance as well as increased depreciation and amortization. We continue to exercise disciplined cost management across the business. We are and will continue to invest in our technology transformation, data and analytics, new products and security, and will accelerate investment in these areas as we believe we can deliver accelerated benefits. Outside of these areas, headcount additions are being held at levels below attrition, and discretionary spending has been reduced. Across the company, business travel remains at virtually zero. We're in the process of reviewing our real estate footprint as well as other areas that may allow further structural cost improvements. We expect to begin implementing cost improvement items over the next several quarters. We do not expect meaningful cost improvements in 2020. For Q2 2020, the effective tax rate used in calculating adjusted EPS was 24.4% and about 1% higher than we expected for the quarter. We expect the 3Q 2020 tax rate to be about 21%. Full year effective tax rate used in calculating adjusted EPS is expected to be about 24%. In 2Q 2020 and year-to-date, operating cash flow of $251 million and $282 million respectively were both up $34 million from 2019. Increases in operating cash flow in 2Q 2020 and first half 2020 were partially offset by $48 million and $95 million of legal settlement payments in 2Q 2020 and year-to-date, respectively. The timing of payments of the remaining $347 million to the U.S. Consumer Restitution Fund is principally dependent on the resolution of the appeals filed related to this case. At this time, we do not expect to fund the remainder of the settlement until late 2020 or early 2021. Our liquidity and balance sheet remains strong. As indicated on slide eight, we had almost $2.7 billion in available liquidity at June 30th, including $1.4 billion in cash and available borrowing capacity on our bank credit NAR facilities of $1.3 billion. As Mark mentioned, our 2Q results were substantially stronger than the implication of the trends through May that we discussed in our June investor call. The improved results were about 70% in our U.S. B2B business, with the bulk of the remainder in International, broad-based across our geographies. In U.S. B2B, online was about two-thirds of the improvement, split evenly between mortgage and non-mortgage. The remainder of the strength in the USIS Financial Marketing Services and Workforce Solutions unemployment insurance claims business. The strength in adjusted EPS reflects the margin impact from the stronger revenue. Slides 9 through 12 show details of revenue trends on a local currency basis that we saw in 1Q and 2Q, as well as in April, May and June. There were two more business days in June this year versus 2019, which benefited growth rate on the order of 3%. We are also providing the view of the trends so far during the month of July and their implications on 3Q 2020 if they were to continue throughout the quarter. The line items, for which daily trends are not available or not relevant, we did not provide monthly actuals, but did provide 1Q and 2Q data, as well as an estimate for 3Q 2020. The monthly actual provided should be viewed as directional. Starting with slide 9. U.S. B2B revenue trended very positively through June as online strengthened across USIS and EWS driven by strength in mortgage online and improving trends in non-mortgage online revenue. This, coupled with a very strong 2Q performance in Workforce Solutions unemployment insurance claims business and the growth in USIS Financial Marketing Services and much better performance than yet expected, resulted in a very strong U.S. B2B revenue growth in 2Q. Trends in U.S. online over the past month have approximately flattened. Online mortgage daily revenue levels continue to be strong but are somewhat variable by week and have been about on average consistent over the past month. The July trends for mortgage reflect a continuation of the current daily revenue trend adjusted for seasonality, with a lower growth rate due to significant increase in mortgage revenue we saw last year in 3Q and 4Q. Online mortgage -- sorry, online non-mortgage revenue growth was flattened over the past month. USIS non-mortgage online revenue growth levels have shown slight declines, while EWS non-mortgage revenue has remained relatively flat. July trends provided for online non-mortgage revenue reflect these trends. Workforce Solutions and Employer Services driven by unemployment insurance claims activity is expected to show growth in 3Q again, but at levels much lower than in 2Q. USIS financial marketing services in 2Q benefited from new business, both in portfolio review and marketing services. Given the uncertainty in the economy, the mid-July estimate provided for USIS marketing services does not assume that this recurs again. In total for U.S. B2B, if the trends and assumptions hold for 2Q, we should see another very strong quarter. Turning to slide 10. As Mark discussed earlier, International saw improvements in all regions as we moved through 2Q, with June revenue down only 7% versus 2019. This consistent improvement across all regions resulted in a much smaller revenue decline in the quarter than anticipated. The July revenue growth trend shared reflects, in general, a continuation of the daily revenue trends seen over the past month through the rest of the third quarter. GCS, July trend shared with you reflect the trends Mark discussed earlier. In consumer direct, growing total subscribers are expected to lead to slight revenue growth in 3Q. Partner revenue, which includes our benefits channel and event-based business, is expected to decline about 10% in 3Q with a significantly larger decline likely in 4Q. As Mark mentioned, GCS total revenue in second half 2020 is expected to decline by more than 5%, with a decline in 4Q much larger than 3Q due to expected significant declines in Lead Gen related partner business. Slide 11 provides a comparison of economic factors impacting the mortgage market in the current environment during environment during the 2008-2009 financial crisis and the 2013-2014 mortgage downturn. We are sharing this information to provide you with additional information for your use as you estimate Equifax second half 2020 results. Based on data provided by Black Knight, at current 30-year mortgage rates of about 3%, there are over 18 million mortgages likely eligible for refinance. This is the highest level we have seen over the past year and much higher than in 2008 through 2010 or 2013 and 2014. The refi potential is highly dependent on a number of factors, including interest rates. For example, again, based on Black Knight's data, an increase in the 30-year fixed mortgage rate to 3.5% will reduced refi potential to $10 million and an increase to 4% in the interest would reduce the refi potentials under $5 million. As you saw last week, mortgage rates were at an all-time low of just under 3%. The current U.S. unemployment at 11% is higher than we saw in either 2008 through 2010 or 2013 through 2014. The forecast for unemployment in second half 2020 that is provided in this chart is by Moody's analytics. In addition, we'll continue to watch key metrics, including mortgage delinquency rates, credit scores, leverage levels, both in terms of debt-to-income and loan-to-value closely. As it is still early in the current crisis, the impact on consumer employment income and the direction of ongoing government support are still evolving. Due to the continuing uncertainties in forecasting the direction, depth, and duration of the recession related to the actions to combat COVID-19, we're not going to provide third quarter guidance and do not expect to provide guidance for the remainder of 2020. However, for perspective on total Equifax 3Q 2020 performance, we will again provide an illustrative third quarter framework to help you think about our performance. Please turn to slide 12. To the extent total Equifax revenue continued at the pace I described earlier, 3Q 2020 revenue would be up 4% to 6% year-to-year, resulting in 3Q 2020 revenue of $930 million to $950 million. Adjusted EPS in 3Q 2020 at these revenue levels could be in the range of $1.30 to $1.40 per share, down 6% to 12% from 3Q 2019. Slide 19 also provides a walk-through, explaining the translation versus 3Q 2019 of the revenue growth to the decline in pretax income and therefore, adjusted EPS. Importantly, at these adjusted EPS levels, Equifax will deliver over $325 million in adjusted EBITDA. This is not guidance as there is still much uncertainty as to what impact the pandemic will have on the economy, our customers, business activity, the path to opening the economy, and therefore, our revenue and earnings. This range provided reflects current variability in trends, not a view of potential quarter outcomes. As a reminder, in our April earnings call, we provided detail on the cost and capital spending savings we expect to generate and the tech transformation is complete. As shown on slide 13, total cost savings, excluding D&A, are expected to be on the order of $125 million from the reduction of cost of goods sold and lower development expense. There will also be substantial capital spending savings as capital spending as a percentage declines on the order of 7%, a level that is at or slightly below that of our peers. We expect to begin seeing net to begin seeing net COG savings, excluding D&A in late 2021, and are targeting approaching the run rate of COGS development expense and capital savings during 2022. We will certainly reinvest in some of the savings, so it will not all fall to margin. As Mark referenced earlier, we continue to look to accelerate the completion of our tech transformation, including increasing investment levels in 2020. At present, we expect 2021 time costs related to the Equifax 2020 Technology and Data Security Transformation, exclusive of legal accruals to be about $340 million. We expect capital spending to be about $390 million for the full year. As a reminder, in 2021, we will no longer be adjusting our financial results for one-time costs related to the technology transformation. These one-time technology transformation costs are expected to decline substantially from the levels seen in 2020 and the likely be largest in 1Q 2021 decreasing throughout the remainder of 2021. These one-time technology transformation costs will impact development expense, G&A and COGS. We will continue to disclose these one-time tech transformation costs to allow you to have comparability with our adjusted financial results from 2017 through 2020. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark. Mark Begor : Thanks, John. I'll wrap up by giving you an update on our cloud transformation -- cloud technology and data transformation and our accelerated focus on new products. First, moving to our EFX 2020 Technology Transformation. During 2020, we focused the bulk of our efforts in the cloud technology data transformation on our North American operations, which represent over 80% of our revenue and even higher percentage of our income. Investments in Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific and deploying cloud-native data fabric and our Ignite and InterConnect API analytical and decisioning framework are also progressing well. Initial migration to GCP of our major North American data exchange, the U.S. Canadian consumer ACRO list changes, the work number in NTT is principally complete, and we expect to have complete full migration, including all data ingestion processes for the exchanges in place by year-end. It is at this point that these migrated exchanges become our system of record with our customers. These are critical deliverables for 2020, and completing in this plan remains a strategic focus and priority. These exchanges generate about 70% of North American online revenue. We're also making very good progress in the full migration to GCP of our secondary U.S. exchanges, the commercial risk exchanges, IXI, property and DataX exchanges. We expect a number of these exchanges that have completed full migration by year-end, with the remainder completed in the first half of 2021. And the Canadian commercial risk exchange for migration will also occur in early 2021. In April, we discussed with you the initial migration of our eID identity validation systems, which we expect complete in the third quarter. Customer migrations are expected to start in the second half, and we expect to have fully migrated all eID customers by year-end. Our new Luminate cloud identity and fraud suite being deployed as a cloud-native solution will be available to customers in the U.S. and Canada in the third quarter. And a new eID cloud-native service is also available for the U.S. as part of the new transformed Luminate offering. We are continuing our progress to migrate our customers onto our new cloud based systems, including our InterConnect Ignite API framework. As a reminder, this is a common set of services on, which we are working to migrate all USIS, EWS and International customers. At the end of the second quarter, USIS had migrated 1,200 U.S. customers, and International completed migrations of about 2,000 customers. We expect to continue this pace of migration. We expect this pace of migration to accelerate in the second half of 2020, with over 10,000 USIS customer migrations completed by year-end, and the majority of the remaining U.S. customer migrations completed by mid-2021. We continue to adjust our development priorities to add platform capabilities to ease our customers' ability to easily migrate to our new platforms. As we discussed in April, our new Ignite analytics and machine learning platform is available and in production at EWS and will be available at GCP this quarter. We continue to make strong progress globally, rolling out our Ignite analytics platform with over 200 customers using Ignite, direct and marketplace, including two new Fintech customers added in the second quarter. An additional substantial benefit from transforming our own and on-premise infrastructure to Google, will be a significant reduction in our carbon footprint, which is a focus area of our ESG strategy. Google remains the only cloud provider that uses 100% renewable energy in their centers, which we will benefit from. We are making strong progress in our cloud technology and data transformation and remain energized about the future top and bottom-line benefits John discussed earlier. Our cloud-native data and infrastructure is and will differentiate Equifax in the marketplace. Shifting to slide 14, which highlights our new product initiative focus, which is a key component of our EFX2020 Strategy and is our next chapter as we leverage our cloud, data and technology transformation for growth. To strengthen our capabilities and product management and API, we recently added a new Chief Product Officer, Cecilia Mao, who has deep product expertise from prior roles with FICO, Verisk, and Oracle. Cecilia joined Mark Luber, our new USIS Product Officer, with a goal of accelerating our product management capability to drive new product growth. We expect to continue to add product resources in the second half to position half to position us for growth in 2021 and beyond. We continue to launch new and refined existing products to support our customer-specific needs during the COVID pandemic. This includes our Equifax Response NOW product initiative in USIS and tailored I-9 and UC Solutions and Workforce Solutions. USIS recently announced the addition of an industry-specific FICO score segmentation data to our weekly consumer trends reports. With this integration, Equifax is the first company to weekly industry-specific FICO score segmentation reports, enabling businesses across the industry to better track anonimized consumer trends, behaviors, and credit performance across the U.S., which allows our customers to better anticipate consumer behavior changes as a result of the COVID recession. As we progress through the year, we continue to make strong progress on our goal to expand our NPI rollouts and deliver over 100 new products in 2020, which is up from about 90 last year in 60 in 2018. Through June, we've launched 70 new products, and we have an active pipeline of new products at various stages in the pipeline funnel. Some of the new product launches include a USIS launched FICO 10-T. The FICO 10-T score incorporates trended data for strategies and use cases that benefit from additional trended data insights into consumer behavior. We work with FICO to incorporate trended credit bureau data to offer a view on the trajectory of certain data fields over time, such as account balance amounts reported over the past 24 months. Consumer behavior -- consumer payment behavior and credit limit information can also be captured via the trended data. Workforce Solutions also have a strong NPI focus. As we discussed on our June 8th call, Workforce Solutions recently launched a number of new mortgage solutions, including mortgage TWN ID and I-9 Anywhere products. Both are seeing strong market growth. Another area of focus is the expansion of the data sets in our talent reports. New multi-data solutions incorporating employment, ID verification, and degree verification can add value to hiring decisions in high turnover industries such as retail, restaurants, manufacturing, and hospitality, especially as we look at the post-COVID recovery period. We also continue to make good progress with our positive data in Australia and now have over 80% of positive data from contributors, with about 90% of the credit card and mortgage data and more than 50% of the auto and P loan data in our database. We've begun to use this positive data in Australia to provide analytical insights to our customers and expect to launch additional new products later this year. NPIs continue to be an important lever for Equifax growth and a priority for me and to the team. We prioritize our focus and resources on driving NPI rollouts in 2020, and more recently, a global focus on products to support our customers during the COVID recession. We will continue to prioritize new products and innovation in the second half to leverage our cloud data and technology transformation for future growth. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we remain actively engaged with stakeholders in the public and private sectors regarding Equifax solutions that accurately portray the risk profile of consumers, while recognizing the unique and likely temporary nature of the financial impact of the pandemic. In every country where we do business, Equifax is in discussions with lawmakers and regulators to enable continued credit reporting that captures the status of consumer payments and lender accommodations. Depending on the geography, we've worked independently in conjunction with our peers and our trade associations to provide proactive assistance to financial institutions seeking guidance on how to report during this time frame. In U.S., we're in regular communications with federal regulators, including the CFPB, where we're sharing data trends with the bureau regarding both consumers and publisher [ph]. We're proud that our import has contributed to regulatory guidance at the bureau is published a broadly inform the marketplace. Furthermore, at least three of our most significant markets around the world, Equifax is providing data and insights directly to federal governments to help policymakers understand the pandemic\u2019s consequences on consumers in the credit economy. We recognize that many consumers have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and our experienced economic distress. Equifax has established a COVID resource section on our website to assist consumers looking to manage their epidemics potential impact on their credit standing. In April, we joined the other U.S. credit bureaus and announcing that we're providing free credit reports to all U. S. consumers through April 2021. We're also offering free credit reports to Canadian consumers. More recently, Bev Anderson, our Business Unit Leader for GCS, hosted a series of informational webinars for consumers on managing credit during COVID pandemic. Our GCS team is also participating in industry webinars and events to educate stakeholders regarding the options, as well as the reporting standards. We will continue to support consumers and remain engaged as a constructive partner to help consumers businesses in the overall economy during this challenging time. Wrapping up, turning to slide 15. As John outlined earlier, we're still unable to provide guidance for the third quarter or the second half. We still see meaningful uncertainty from the impacts of the COVID pandemic as cases rise tragically in many markets, impacting shelter in place orders, consumer confidence and economic activity. There's also a real risk for the second COVID wave in the fall and potential for increased lockdowns. We also expect further impacts from unemployment, furloughs and salary reductions as government support programs expire in the coming weeks. Like other companies, we have very limited visibility in the depth and breadth and length of the COVID recession or the timing or strength of recovery until we have a broadly available vaccine. This uncertainty makes it challenge to provide our traditional guidance for the third quarter and second half. We hope the framework John provided is helpful as you think about the range of outcomes for Equifax in the third quarter and second half. Even in this challenging environment, Equifax is operating extremely well. Our strong business model is resilient and delivering in the COVID environment while investing -- while allowing us to invest in the future. Our performance in the second quarter followed a strong first quarter and our momentum in the second half of 2019. Our strong results allow Equifax to continue to invest in our cloud data technology transformation, data and analytics, and new products to position Equifax for future growth in 2021 and beyond. As we look forward to the rest of 2020 and towards 2021 and 2022, we are confident in our business model, strategy for growth, cloud, data, and technology investments and the ability to perform in a challenging COVID environment. We have a very strong team with deep domain expertise, and we continue to strengthen that team. We delivered strong financial results again in the second quarter, with double-digit constant currency revenue growth for the second quarter in a row, with over 200 basis points of margin expansion, while continuing to invest in our cloud, data, and technology transformation, data and analytics, and new products. Workforce Solutions is a franchise business that is strongly outperforming. We gave you a deep dive in Workforce a few weeks ago and expect continued strong performance from Workforce Solutions in the COVID recession with strong growth potential in the long-term. Workforce delivered exceptionally strong revenue growth in the second quarter, up over 50% of adjusted EBITDA in our margins of 55%. These results are the strongest since we acquired the business in 2007, driven by macro events and mortgage and unemployment claims businesses and new claims businesses and new TWN record growth, increased penetration in launching new products. And Workforce Solutions is strongly outgrowing the mortgage market. Our unique TWN income unemployment data is even more valuable in this unprecedented economic event due to the scale, accuracy, and latency of that unique data. We believe Workforce Solutions is well positioned for attractive long-term growth. USIS had another strong quarter with revenue growth of 10% and the strongest first half revenue growth since 2013 led by strong growth in U.S. mortgage. USIS' pipeline are the strongest since 2017 from the renewed commercial focus and rollout of new products. The business is operating well and winning in the marketplace. International executed well against a challenging global economic environment and our GCS direct business is poised for growth in the second half of the year. And as I outlined, we're making very good progress on our cloud, technology, and data transformation and beginning to take advantage of the new cloud-based capabilities. Execution of the cloud investment is a clear priority for our team in 2020. We've accelerated some of our spending, and our focus on the cloud transformation remains strong. We expect a number of our data exchange migrations to completed by year-end, and are well down the path on customer migrations. We know we still have a lot of work to do. We are energized about the strong benefits that will come from this transformation, including always-on-stability, speed-to-market, ability to rapidly new products around the globe, and the strong top of line benefits John talked about. We are continuing to invest in new products and innovation by investing in new product leadership and resources to drive innovative new product rollouts. Our NPI capabilities are being accelerated by our cloud transformation, and we expect to launch over 100 NPIs in 2020. NPI remains a top priority for 2020 in the future, and we continue to expand our investments in new products, leveraging our cloud transformation. We're also making proactive investments in technology and DNA, new products and security, while balancing cost controls across the rest of Equifax. And our balance sheet, as John pointed out, remains strong, ensuring we are prepared to make the necessary investments in our EFX 2020 cloud data and technology transformation, new products and data security, while looking for attractive bolt-on acquisitions. And we continue to support consumers through these challenging times with free credit reports and consumer education on our website. As we look to the second half of 2020 and towards 2021 and 2022, I'm more excited than ever about our future as a market-leading data, analytics and technology company. And with that, operator, let me open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Toni Kaplan, Morgan Stanley. Toni Kaplan : Congratulations on the quarter. I was hoping you could talk about the trend of non-mortgage USIS, and how it improved significantly in June, but then it looks like it got a little bit weaker in July. So just wanted to understand what you're hearing from customers in terms of what's led to the slower July, and how we should be thinking about going forward? Mark Begor : Yeah. Toni, I'll start and then John can jump in. We were pleased with the kind of sequential improvement in USIS broadly, and then, of course, in non-mortgages we went through the quarter, particularly a shelter in place orders were listed and economic activity improved. So that was a positive. We just wanted to point out there's still real uncertainties in the marketplace. We've seen markets like Florida, and Texas and California that it had some of the recent COVID spikes from our online volumes, seeing some impact on that. It's not meaningful, but it's not continuing the sequential trend. So we really just wanted to point out that we expect some uncertainties going forward. One of the other positives that I pointed out a couple of times is the fact that the USIS new deal pipeline in their win rate continue to grow through the second quarter off of the first quarter and off of last year. And for us, that's probably the most important element. It's quite challenging to forecast the economic outlook. But seeing Workforce Solutions accelerate their new product rollouts, and really winning in the marketplace competitively is quite positive for us as we think about the third quarter. John Gamble : And Toni, if you're looking at slide 9, right, just as a reminder, as you look at June, June, because of the number of business days in the month, right, was -- there's about a 3% benefit, or a little over 3% that you see in June that doesn't really continue into July. So that can help you understand the trend the trend better between June and July. So, for example, if you look at banking and lending, Mark mentioned banking and lending, there, we adjusted that 3 point, you're probably looking at, banking lending was down 10% to 15% in the June period. And what we have seen is slight weakening as you go into the very end of July -- into June and July and the trends across several USIS verticals. It wasn't substantial, but the substantial improving trends we've seen from April through June flattened and then weakened slightly. Mark Begor : Just -- make one last point Toni is that the biggest challenge right now is when will our customers restart marketing. And we've seen some increased activity from a below 2019. But there's just so much uncertainty for our customers around the consumer and the economy. Many of them have pulled back on marketing. In counter to that, we've seen a significant increase in activity and dialogues around portfolio management, which is typical in an economic downturn. A lot of resource is shift to managing the backlog, managing existing customers, managing credit lines. So we've got that positive going in marketing. When will our customers get comfortable to market again, I think, is the big question, and I think there's a lot of uncertainty on that. Toni Kaplan : That's very helpful. For my follow-up, just wanted to ask about the really strong margins in Workforce Solutions, Obviously, you had a very strong verifications quarter. So, was that the real driver, or are you also getting some additional leverage from the employer services vertical as well? Just wanted to understand the strength of margins and the sustainability of that? Mark Begor : Yes. You get the two items that are very strong, obviously. UC claims is high incremental margin as is the growth in verification, so both of those are driving our margins. We've got -- as you know, revenue growth broadly in our business and in Workforce Solutions, incremental revenue growth delivers very, very high incremental margins, which is driving that. And the other thing of workforce that we pointed out that we were pleased with is how we outgrew the mortgage market. That really is a reflection of the power and the weakness of the data assets they have and the multiple levers we talked about on the June call with Workforce Solutions. John Gamble : The other thing I would mention is that this is happening in a period when we have strong cost controls in place. So, you're seeing costs are being managed very, very tightly while they're seeing very high revenue growth. Toni Kaplan : Makes sense. Thanks a lot. Operator : Next up, from Credit Suisse is Kevin McVeigh. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Thanks. Mark Begor : Hey Kevin. Kevin McVeigh : Hey, how are you? It not a really nice detail in terms of how EWS positively impacts mortgage. Can you kind of help us frame how it impacts the rest of the credit products that you kind of offer right now? And as we think about that into 2021 as income start to tick up the core USIS, more broadly, first mortgage in that EWS? Mark Begor : Yes. We've talked, Kevin, before. I think you're talking about the fact that we go to market as one Equifax with our customers. And as you know, USIS sells to all of our financial institutions, the USIS credit products as well as the Workforce Solutions' verification product. So that kind of bundled approach to our customers, we think is a smart way to go-to-market. It gives us the ability to incent our commercial team to sell a full Equifax solution. It gives us the ability to leverage product positions on both the credit and verification side when we're in discussions with customers. And so we're clearly seeing the ability seeing the ability to approach customers with a broad Equifax solution that would include credit data, wealth, and employment data, our NTT data and then, of course, our verification data from Workforce Solutions and bundled solutions in many cases, which we think is attractive for Equifax. Kevin McVeigh : Got it. And then just real quick, you talked about kind of 100 new NTIs and part of that being just positively impacted by your cloud transformation. In the cloud transformation, is it the expense benefit that allows you to do that, or do they become more seamless through the cloud, or just could you just help us frame that a little bit more from an NPI perspective? Mark Begor : Yes. We've been consistently talking about this, Kevin, for the last couple of years. That was our expectation that the cloud transformation would allow us to accelerate the ability to get more new products to market and also getting the product to market more quickly and we're starting to see that. The good news is we're already -- really in the last six months as we've gotten deep into the cloud transformation, we've been able to roll out new products and we talked about this on the April call. We're putting new products in the marketplace that we couldn't do two years ago because of the single-data fabric, our ability to combine data assets, our ability to ingest new solutions, having a simpler application infrastructure, speeding up our ability to bring products to market. And we're excited about starting to see the early benefits of that. And we do believe those benefits will accelerate, meaning our ability to do more new products in the future. And you're seeing that as we go from 60 products to 90 last year to over 100 this year. And our goal, and we're putting resources around it to really leverage our massive investment in the cloud transformation for both data and our technology to accelerate our new products rollouts in 2021 and 2022. I think as you know, that's a real fuel for growth in our industry and for Equifax. So we've got a really big focus on it, we've brought some great new talent in, we're going to add resources and people against it in the second half, because we really look at new products as being the next chapter for Equifax around driving our growth and really leveraging our cloud, data and technology transformation. Operator : And our next question comes from Manav Patnaik of Jefferies. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, it's actually [indiscernible] hey guys. The first question I have for you is the commercial. You mentioned that you talked about typically in the USIS business. I was just wondering you could give us some color. Is that pipelines and win that you talked about coming from your competitive, or is it stuff that maybe was just, kind of, put on hold or independent box till you got back the way you left to do? I was just hoping for a little bit more color on some of the mix there? Mark Begor : Yeah. It's all of the above. I think you've got -- we've got not a new leader anymore, but since he\u2019s been on the ground now for 18 months. He really remade the commercial organization that's been in place for six months. There's a real increased focus commercially in the marketplace. So I think that's positive number one. The pipelines are a combination of new products. When you go from 60 to 90 and then towards 100, there's just more opportunities for his team to bring new solutions to our customers. The pipeline growth, we also believe that is from the COVID response products that we've rolled out. This is a -- we tried to highlight on the call earlier; this is a really unprecedented time for our customers. And the value of data broadly for all of us in the industry is even more valuable. And actually, if you go back to 2008-2009, they're just more options for our customers to use data and manage in recession. So I think that's driving all of our capabilities in our conversations with our customers. And then there's no question, we talked about our win rates being up on a year-over-year basis. We're clearly more competitive in the marketplace. There's -- the overhang that was perhaps here a year ago from the cyber event, we believe, is way behind us. And we're really just focused on a normal node, that I would call it a fairly aggressive mode in the marketplace to really support our customers in this challenging time. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. And just on the new products, 70 to 100 the new products a year. I know all the creditors have actually had the cadence revive and just been impressive. But I was just wondering, how do you define what a new product is? And I think in the past that has actually talked about how you would expect the NPI to contribute, kind of, 10% of revenues in a two-year time frame or something. Do you have any such goals of that to provide some perspective? Mark Begor : Yeah. We have a very standard rigorous process around what is the new product, it's got to be new. And we've been -- had a consistent process. John, I think, for five-plus years\u2026 John Gamble : It's five years. Mark Begor : \u2026on how we define new products and we try to be transparent with you and others about our new product rollouts because of the importance to our future growth. We think they're quite accretive to the future. And that's why we're doubling down on people and resources to really leverage the cloud transformation. I know there was a framework in the past in our financial framework around the contribution of new products to our revenue growth. As you know, we don't have a financial framework in place today. So, we probably don't want to talk about how we think about that. But I hope you appreciate the focus that I have and we have around new products because we believe it's a really important lever for growth that is going to be accelerated by our call transformation. When you think about why did we do the cloud transformation, there's a lot of reasons. One for sure is to accelerate our topline and the way to accelerate your topline from the cloud transformation is to bring new solutions to market more quickly and more creatively and we believe more uniquely than our competitors. And that's the focus that we have with the cloud. And of course, you get all the cost and cash benefits that John talked about that will start rolling in, in 2021 and 2022 as we complete the execution of the cloud transformation. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thank you, guys. Operator : Next up is Hamzah Mazari, Jefferies. Hamzah Mazari : Good morning. Thank you. Just a question on the international business. Specifically, just margins in the international business. How much of the gap between the USIS business and international? Do you think is just structural and how much can be closed over time, especially as you complete the tech transformation? Mark Begor : Yes. There's no question. Our international margins are lower than our U.S. margins. We have just so much scale in Workforce Solutions in USIS, as you know, versus many of our smaller markets. And some of that is going to be structural, just given the scale of those businesses. We do believe the cloud transformation is going to be accretive to that, improve those margins. And of course, we're focused on other actions and we have been. This isn't new on other actions and we have been. This isn't new to improve those margins, whether it's from new products or incremental growth. And the biggest way to improve margins internationally is topline growth because of the incremental margin impact that comes from that topline growth. And of course, they were impacted most significantly in the second quarter because of the depth and breadth and how severe the lockdowns were. And of course, many of our international markets are still in lockdown. John Gamble : And another meaningful difference is at this point, we don't have Workforce Solutions outside the U.S., and it's a very high-margin business. So, it negatively impacts the margins relative to the U.S. -- outside the U.S. Hamzah Mazari : Got it. Very helpful. And just a follow-up question and I'll turn it over. Could you maybe comment on your exposure to Fintech and how that compares to maybe some of your peers, whether that's an opportunity for you going forward? Thank you. Mark Begor : Yes, I think as you know we talked about this many times, our competitors are much stronger in Fintech. That's been a priority focus of our team since I joined two years and change ago. We had two years a handful of people covering Fintech. And today, we've got, I think, 15 or 16. So, it's a clear focus. We've more than tripled our commercial resources in the last couple of years. We see it as an opportunity. We're having wins there. I talked about in my notes that we had two U.S. Fintech customers at Ignite in the second quarter. So, we're actively engaged with Fintech. And Fintech is a couple of hundred million dollars space in the U.S., growing faster than the core market. It's actually a bit more impacted in COVID recession right now than the broader market, but it's a space that we want to be bigger in, and we're focused on. Hamzah Mazari : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question today is David Togut, Evercore ISI. David Togut : Thank you. Good morning. I would appreciate your thoughts on Joe Biden's plan to mandate that federal agencies use a new public credit bureau. Could you just walk through your exposures to, kind of, government revenue, and over what time frame this new bureau might be developed? Mark Begor : Yes. You have two different questions there, David. First on the government revenues, from our perspective are unrelated to Vice President Biden's and Senator Sanders proposal. And our government revenues are really at for social services, so our government revenues won't be impacted. And as you might imagine, we think the current credit bureau system in the U. S. well serves consumers and publishers. There's plenty of competition between the large three credit bureaus. We don't see a need for what was outlined in that proposal. We would suspect it's perhaps more positioning in an election cycle versus something that would have broad bipartisan support. And if you look around the globe, the few global markets where there is a government credit bureau, over time, either they've been privatized or private credit bureaus have operated against next to them. So we think the system in the United States today serves the market extremely well in a very competitive way. David Togut : Got it. And to the extent the government and credit bureau were to be developed, how long do you think it would take to build it? Just trying to assess the overall risk to Equifax? Mark Begor : Yeah. I think that's a tough question, too, David. Equifax, we're spending $1 billion a year in technology in 2020, and we have for a long time to go to the industry. This is an extremely complex set. There's trillions of records, there's thousands and thousands of contributors. It will be a very long road. And again, from our perspective, that may be a reason why there wouldn't be bipartisan support for it. I think the broader perspective on why there would be bipartisan support as the system works today. It services the industry well, it services consumers well, there's great transparency. And if you look at the increase in alternative data, there's just more opportunities to support consumers, which is really what I believe Vice President Biden is focused on is how do you ensure that credit access to those that need it is available in the marketplace. And we believe the bureau today provides great support and great focus on that. David Togut : Understood. Greatly appreciate your insights. Operator : And next, we'll go to Bill Warmington, Wells Fargo. Mark Begor : Hi, Bill. Bill Warmington : Good morning, everyone. Mark Begor : Morning. Bill Warmington : So first question for you. What percent -- what was total mortgage exposure as a percent of total Equifax revenue in Q2? John Gamble : Actually off the top of my head, I don't know, Bill, it's up substantially. I think it's on the order of 30%. But if you take a look at slide 9 and slide 10, I think we give plenty of data there for you to come up with that number yet. Bill Warmington : Got it. Okay. And then it sounds like the new product pipeline is pretty full. I know you guys were the first bureau to do the beta test on the FICO Resilience index. I wanted to ask if there was a way to tie the work number more closely into the FICO score. Mark Begor : It's a good question. I think we talked, Bill, broadly about our focus on one of the benefits we expect from our cloud-native transformation, as you know, it's a technology transformation and a data transformation, but the single-data fabric that we're going to, we believe, is going to allow we're going to, we believe, is going to allow us to do many more data combinations then we're able to do easily today. And that's one of the many reasons we're doing the cloud transformation. That would be an example of using income employment data with some of our other our other data assets to bring unique solutions that are on the Equifax because of our Workforce Solutions business to the marketplace. And we have those not in our current pipeline, but those kind of things on our to-do list in our pipeline in the future. And it's another reason, Bill; why I'm expanding our product resources across Equifax in the second quarter, and we're going to expand them further in the second half is really to really fuel up that new product engine, not only for the second half, but for 2021 and 2022. That's a big focus of mine is to take advantage of the single data fabric in the cloud, in the cloud technology we're going to have to really accelerate our new product rollouts. Bill Warmington : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : And Andrew Nicholas from William Blair is up next. Andrew Nicholas : Hi good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to first talk about operating expenses. I think now we're a few months into this, I want to understand that you already committed to; I believe it was $90 million of cost cuts. I was just wondering if you could speak a bit more about how you're thinking about that line in the medium to long-term. And I guess I'm wondering to what extent you've identified additional areas for cost rationalization over the past couple of months as the Workforce gets more and more comfortable working from home, whether it be on the real estate side, TME, so on and so forth? Mark Begor : Yes, I hope you got the tone of our conversation. We're keeping a tight belt here because we still see meaningful uncertainty in the second half about the pandemic. At the same time, I hope you got our tone that we're making targeted investments. With our financial strength, we want to make sure we're making those investments for the future. But we are accruing kind of net benefits on a year-over-year basis on our cost structure. And certainly, during our plan we had in place early in the year, from some of the belt tightening we've done. You point out P&L travel. When you think about the near-term, no one's traveling at Equifax. And so that's a clear savings on a year-over-year basis. On a long-term run rate, I suspect the way we use video will meaningfully change our travel spend going forward. We spend -- about half of our P&L is spent in internal travel, meaning between Equifax sites. My view is post-COVID, that will go to zero. We just won't need to do it because we're so much more a depth at working together and collaborating through the use of Google Hangouts and other video tools. So, I think that's kind of a change that will be permitting. I think our business travel to customers will likely be lower just because of the efficiency of video. Instead of making three trips to a customer to work on a new product, you might make one post-COVID. And then have four or five video calls and do the whole project quicker just because of how we're working. So, I think there's the efficiency and collaboration on video, I do think will have a significant change. On the real estate side, we're going to go through -- we've got a handful of small offices that really got highlighted for us in the COVID recession. We're going to close those. It just doesn't make sense to have 20, 30, 40-person offices. Those seems to either work-from-home or be consolidated in other sites. So there'll be some real estate benefit there. We haven't gone off the next step of deciding whether we change our broader real estate footprint, so I suspect we'll look at that as the year progresses. But as you point out, we're -- we operated very effectively in a work-from-home mode, and we're still operating with our Red-Blue teams in a 50%, we're actually higher work-from-home mode, meaning we only have less than half of the team in our offices every week and the other house working from home, and Equifax is operating extremely well. So that will be something that we'll look at in the second half. Do you have anything to add? John Gamble : Nothing. You covered all. Mark Begor : Okay. Does that cover where you were heading? Andrew Nicholas : Yeah -- no, that's really helpful. Thank you. And then just one more for my follow-up. It looks like in the case of Canada and Asia Pacific, you had a little bit of a spike in growth in June, or at least less abrupt decline in June before slowing down again in July. Any color on what might be driving that spike? And then how you're thinking about International recovery timeline more broadly in the second half? Thank you. Mark Begor : Yeah, it's tough, as you know, to predict. I think what we've seen pretty consistently in all markets. If you look at April and May, fairly severe lockdowns, not a lot of economic activity, as you got into May and June, in most markets, our customers figured out how to operate in a lockdown environment. And we're having commercial activity. Selling cars without showrooms being open and that's happening around the globe, so that, kind of, adaptability to a lockdown. I think the challenging international is their lockdown. We've seen U.S. lockdowns, kind of, relax in the last four, five weeks in many, many markets. Of course, you've seen some tightening or consumer confidence issues around the spikes in the last couple of weeks in many markets. But international lockdowns have just been extended. It is just much longer. We have markets like Australia. I think Melbourne -- in our Melbourne market is not going to open until late August. So those delays, we believe, and the depth of the lockdowns in many international markets really dampened their economic activity, which impacted our revenue. As those markets open up, we would expect to see improvements, but we just can't predict when and how much. So we would expect to see those improve as companies adapt and as actually restrictions are lifted, and there's some level of kind of COVID normalcy. John Gamble : If you're looking at slide 10, also, just looking at APAC, it was a positive number. But as Mark said in his comments, there was a one-time sale to a government entity there that resulted in that positive step. So excluding that, it was down single digits. And then again, just as a reminder, looking at June, right, there's probably a three to four point benefit from the fact that the number of business days in June is higher. So when you compare June to July, that's something you have to take into account. Andrew Nicholas : Yeah. I must have missed it. Thank you. Operator : Next question is George Milhalos of Cowen. Mark Begor : Hey, George. George Milhalos : Hey, good morning guys. Congrats and thanks for taking my question. Mark, just wanted to talk a little bit about Workforce Solutions, and obviously, tremendous momentum there, particularly this year, within mortgage and on the unemployment side, and you talked about it being still in, sort of, the second or third inning, if we're looking at longer term from a growth perspective. I'm just curious, if we would have thought of Workforce as at least being a high single digit top line growing, probably low double digit top line grower. Should we be thinking that as we look out over the next year or two that some of that growth or a substantial part of that growth has been kind of pulled forward now in 2020, so that it may be sort of a sub-trend for a year or two before sort of normalizing longer term for the growth perspective? John Gamble : Yes. I don't -- we don't want to get into giving 2021 or 2022 guidance, but we've talked at length on the June 8th call and more this morning about the multiple levers Workforce Solutions has. And as you know, one of the very unique levers they have versus most of our businesses, and I think most of the industry is the ability to grow their revenue by driving hit rate through increased records. And I think that's a very unique element to that business. And if you think quite simply, which sometimes I do, the business will be over $1 billion this year and it has, call it, roughly 50% of the non-farm payroll in a database. Now, our long-term goal is to get all of non-farm payroll in our database. And we've shown a pretty consistent ability to add those records. If we get from half to all of the non-farm payroll, you double the size of that business over a timeframe, extended for sure, but that's a lever that's unique. There's no question that there'll be -- we're in the middle of middle -- I don't know what portion we're in of the U.S. mortgage refi and purchase market that is exceptionally strong. There's going to be a grow over challenge on that for Equifax in 2021, as you point out. But if you saw in our comments, Workforce Solutions, in particular, significantly outgrew the mortgage market because of new products, because of new records, because of new customers, they have all those levers in new verticals that they can get into outside of mortgage, those give us a lot of confidence in Workforce Solutions' long-term growth, which is why I characterize it as being in early innings, meaning this is a mature business, it's a well operating business, but it just has a lot of runway for growth opportunities. George Mihalos : Okay, that's very helpful. I appreciate that color. And then just a quick question for you, John, as it relates to corporate expense and the outlook there. I mean those numbers came in a little bit better than what we were looking for. Is this sort of 2Q corporate expense run rate a good way to think about 3Q, absent, I think, a $5 million increase in redundant system costs relative to 2Q? John Gamble : Yes. So, I think we're going to continue to perform well, relatively speaking, against corporate expenses. Within corporate expenses, there obviously some things that are a little more variable, like incentive compensation and things that drive movement period-to-period. So, I'm not going to really give a forecast for 3Q and 4Q. But in terms of the cost reduction actions we have in place, I think those are going to stay very firm in place around corporate, so you should see improving performance on our corporate expenses pretty consistently. George Mihalos : Okay, great. Thank you guys. John Gamble : Thanks. Operator : Next up is Andrew Steinerman, JPMorgan. Andrew Steinerman : Hi. I just wanted to clarify a quick thing on International. I definitely collect that you're saying stricter and longer lockdowns in some key international geographies like Australia. My thought was that Europe went into lockdown earlier and started reopening earlier. And so when I look on slide 10 on the European CRA line for Equifax, is that what you're seeing, or are you saying something about lockdowns that I'm not catching about Europe? Mark Begor : Yes. From our perspective, Andrew, like the U.K. is still in lockdown, meaning our office is not open. Our customers' offices aren't open. They're still working from home. Economic activity, we believe, is depressed because of that versus if you look at like Georgia, which is opened, and other markets in the United States. Spain opened just a couple of weeks ago. Canada is particularly a Toronto market is still in lockdown, meaning they're not open. For most commercial activity in Australia is still in lockdown. So our experience is that -- and our perspective is that the international markets lockdown sooner, and they lockdown longer, and of course, we don't see business in Italy, which, as you know, lockdown opens up quicker, but the markets that we're in are the ones I'm referencing. Andrew Steinerman : I got it. Mark Begor : And we're heavily U.K. based, right? So for us, the bulk of the CRA is U.K. Andrew Steinerman : Right. I know. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Next up is Jeff Meuler, Baird. Mark Begor : Hi, Jeff. Jeff Meuler : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Just a follow-up, Mark, on that answer you just recently gave on the ability to consistently add records -- TWN records. Just how is the pipeline there? Is it being positively or negatively impacted by the current environment? And then on -- there was a comment in the prepared remarks about active records. I think being more flattish than much. I tried to kind of initial top of claims and unemployment. Is that a headwind that is at all a headwind that is at all meaningful, or are the individuals that are rolling off active records, just not particularly active, I guess, from a credit application perspective, so it doesn't really impact you. Thanks. Mark Begor : Yeah. First, on the pipeline, we have -- as you know, we have a dedicated team. We talked about that at June 8. This is all they do is focused on records at either as I would call it, going door-to-door to companies that they are not a part of our database or working on partnerships with payroll processors and others that we do revenue share with. And they have a very active pipeline. We -- what I would characterize is put them on offense in the second quarter. They were before, but we're deliberately leaning in. And on both sides, if you think about your company and you're under some financial pressure, today, you do that yourself in many cases, meaning you're taking calls from mortgage originators into the HR department and you've got a handful of people staffing a call center to respond to your employee calls on that. If we go in and can share our value prop, where we'll do it for free for them, we'll do it securely, it becomes a productivity improvement for that company. So that's a positive. So from a climate standpoint, it's always a good discussion. It's maybe better now. And then in the partnerships, the idea of getting an incremental revenue share from Equifax from a -- to a payroll processor. Those conversations are positive, too. So we like the pipeline. As you know, it's a bit choppy sometimes. We added a large processor last September. We're benefiting from that now. Those can be clunky or chunky. But we have a consistent focus on adding records, and we've shown a pretty good trend of adding them. On your question about the impact of unemployment is something we're watching. We expect there to be some pressure on actives in there. We had some decline in the latter half of the second quarter that were offset by additions that we have with new contributors and new employees or records coming in, and we expect to keep that focus going in the third quarter, but we\u2019re definitely watching it. And I think lastly, I think, as you know, we not only sell active records, meaning those that are working, but we also have a pretty large portion of our revenue Workforce Solutions is inactive records, meaning where with someone working two weeks ago, two months ago, three weeks ago, because people change jobs. And if we don't have an active, many times, we're able to sell the inactive, meaning what they were doing six months ago before they change jobs, and that becomes -- that's another part of our revenue. Operator : We'll go next to George Tong, Goldman Sachs. George Tong : Hi thanks. Good morning. So, USIS online mortgage revenue growth moderated from 62% in June to 35% in July, and then EWS mortgage growth went from over 100% in June to 70% in July. Presumably, this is all due to tougher comps. Any other factors that you might point out that could have contributed to the slowing growth? And if it was due truly to tougher comps, can you help frame how comps will evolve over the next two to three quarters? Mark Begor : You want to take it John? John Gamble : Sure. It's principally tougher comps. A little bit of a seasonality, right? I take a look at the way the mortgage market tends to run. You tend to see a weaker mortgage market as you get towards the back half of the year. But in terms of tougher comps, the mortgage market really started to strengthen in 2019 August and was very strong in September and was very strong in the fourth quarter. So, you're going to see those tougher comps run through third quarter and fourth quarter and then obviously, you know how strong the mortgage market was in the first quarter and second quarter of 2020. George Tong : Got it. That's helpful. And then on the technology transformation program, could you provide a timeline on when you expect to sunset your legacy systems, and perhaps frame the timing of when you systems, and perhaps frame the timing of when you expect to fully realize your cost savings that you outlined in the presentation? John Gamble : Yes, I think for today, we're not ready to do that. We tried to give indications on it. That's really probably getting more into our long-term framework as well as our outlook for 2021 or something, which, as you know, we're not providing guidance. But I think we try to be clear about -- we've got a lot of confidence in the benefits. We tried to talk about when we're bringing applications online and databases into the cloud and then how we're progressing on customer migrations because, as you know, we've got to complete migrations in order to sunset our legacy infrastructure. So, I think we're going to hold off in much more detail than we already have until we get closer to 2021 and we're putting our long-term financial framework back in place. George Tong : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Next is Gary Bisbee, Bank of America Securities. Mark Begor : Hey Gary. Gary Bisbee : Hi. Thank you. So, I understand you're not giving guidance, and there's a lot of uncertainty around mortgage trends it's trends in general. But if we think about, at some point, the mortgage business softening and obviously, unemployment claims as well, can you help us think through how the decremental margins would be on softer sales from those two end markets? Mark Begor : So Gary, again, I think that's kind of getting into kind of a longer term view in the 2021 outlook, and we're just not ready to do that yet. We've given a fair amount of commentary even in this discussion around the fact that our margins in mortgage are obviously not nearly as strong as they are in the normal online business, principally because of mortgage solutions, right, because mortgage solutions, we purchase files from our two competitors. So, there's -- those margins are still good in our mortgage business on average, but not nearly as high as we'd see in a normal online poll. And -- but there's a lot of moving parts that are going to go into what 2021 and 2022 look like. So, I think we're all going to have to see how the markets evolve and we'll give you a lot more view as to what we expect for that as we get toward the end of the year. Gary Bisbee : Let me take another cut at that and if you can't answer, that's fine. But as I look at the incremental margin on revenue growth in the last five years at Workforce Solutions, it's obviously been terrific and it's been relatively stable within a range, including the last few quarters, where there's been a major benefit to revenue. Is there any reason -- and I'm not asking you when, and asking about 2021, but any reason to think when revenue -- if revenue were to weaken in that business temporarily that you would see a very different incremental margin on the downside than you've seen on the upside? John Gamble : So again, I don't think we're really going to answer that in detail, right? But what also goes into that is what actions we would take to manage the cost of the business that we have across the entire portfolio, not just specific to Workforce Solutions. So again, I think we're, kind of, getting into more of a long-term outlook here. And at this point, we're going to -- I think we're going to have to ask you to wait until we get toward the end of the year. Gary Bisbee : All right. Fair enough. If I could just sneak in one then on the pipeline, encouraging commentary on the win rates as well. Can you just level set for us, is the pipeline back to the pre-breach levels, or are you still in the process of rebuilding that? And same question for win rates. Thank you. John Gamble : So I think with the pipeline, what we're seeing is it improved a lot over the past three years. Comparing pre and post-breach pipelines is a little bit difficult, right. But I think the really promising things that we're seeing is the pipeline is growing consistently. And then the win rate we're seeing against the pipeline is continuing to grow as well. Again, we're speaking about us is here, right. So I'd say that's what it looks like, and I think we feel good about that trending. Gary Bisbee : Thanks. Operator : And that's all the time we have for questions today at this time. I'll hand things back to Jeff Dodge for any additional or closing remarks. Jeff Dodge : I'd like to thank everybody for their time today. And I think with that, operator, we can terminate the call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation today. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dorian Hare. Please go ahead. Dorian Hare : Thanks and good morning. Welcome to today\u2019s conference call. I\u2019m Dorian Hare. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com. During the call today, we will be making reference to certain materials that can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website under Events and Presentation. These materials are labelled Q3, 2020 Earnings Release Presentation. During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2019 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. Also, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. Certain revenue variances referred to in this call are based on adjusted revenue from the third quarter of 2019. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our website. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark. Mark Begor : Thanks, Dorain good everyone and thanks for joining our third quarter earnings call. Businesses and consumers around the world continue to face challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. I hope you and your families are continuing to be safe in managing this unprecedented environment. At Equifax, we continue to make the health and safety of our 11,000 employees a top priority. Turning first to the slide deck on page number four. Before I cover our very strong third quarter performance, I wanted to recap our focus over the past 3 years to transform Equifax to drive revenue growth, margins and cash in the future. Today, we saw a unique industry and vertical customer and consumer challenges through our differentiated data assets and best-in-class, advanced analytics. Most of our differentiated and -- our most differentiated and most valuable data asset is our 2020 income and employment data. We are building an industry leading global native cloud data technology footprint enabled by best-in-class cloud-native tools that will leverage our new cloud based single data fabric. We\u2019ve taken an industry leadership position in data security by changing our culture, our technology solutions and governance to ensure customer and consumer data is safer than it has ever before. We're relentlessly focused on a customer-first mentality, and we have a market-leading position in 25 countries. In building the new Equifax, we are executing on our $1.5 billion cloud, data and technology transformation that will move our data to a single cloud-native data fabric and into our legacy applications to the Google Cloud. We\u2019re ramping up our investments in innovation and product resources to drive new product acceleration by leveraging our cloud investments. We\u2019re strengthening our differentiated data portfolio with new unique data assets that complement our view of consumers. We\u2019re leveraging advanced analytics, our patented AI technology and cloud-native technology to deliver multi-data solutions, and we\u2019re differentiating our business portfolio by acquiring new capabilities and entering new areas of growth. Turning now to slide number five, the COVID pandemic has accelerated key market macros that are positive for Equifax and for the industry. First, in our data driven economy, it's clear that both deeper insights from comprehensive data sources like the U.S. consumer credit database at Equifax and the use of multiple and alternative data types are critical for risk management, customer prospecting, employment, verification, and an array of other activities engaged by our customers. More differentiated data was a positive macro prior to COVID-19. These economic impacts of the pandemic have only accelerated this trend around differentiated data. Differentiated data and analytics are more valuable than ever to our customers. Second, providers of credit are increasingly delivering real time and advanced analytics that utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning to deliver incremental insights beyond core data. This trend has been accelerated during COVID, including instances where fraudsters have expanded efforts around fraud, account takeover or activities such as loan stacking and -- such as loan stacking. Identity and fraud solutions are increasingly valuable. Third, consumers, especially those from the digital age, have expectations that their financial and workplace interactions function digitally. We\u2019ve seen this trend towards digital accelerate in the current COVID environment as face-to-face interactions have become increasingly rare. And last, Fintechs and alternative lenders are nimbly taking share of wallet from traditional financial institutions. We\u2019ve seen this trend challenge somewhat the near-term due to economic pressures, including disruptions in capital flows, but we expect it will reaccelerate as we move into 2021. The Equifax team is laser focused on delivering solutions to help our customers meet the challenging economic demands caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our new cloud-native data and applications are delivering integrated basically data solution that we were unable to execute on and our legacy environment with unprecedented data, currency and speed. We're applying advanced analytics and alternative data assets towards the creation of trended insights that can better help our customers manage in this COVID environment where the consumer credit profiles are complicated by unemployment, salary reduction, furloughs and lower combinations. Our new cloud-based Luminate identity and fraud platform that uses these advanced analytics, along with machine learning and data orchestration, providing risk managers with greater insights to better manage fraud. And our solutions enable our organizations across industries to adopt new realities using digital solutions to interact with their customers, whether it's an automotive dealership looking to convert online browsers, to online purchasers without stepping for dealership or a credit union looking for way to support members while operating with a reduced branch footprint, Equifax solutions help organization of all types to drive new digital interactions. The COVID recession has accelerated key market macros around the value of broader data assets and real-time decisioning that will benefit Equifax in the future. Turning to slide six. It highlights how Equifax goes beyond the standard credit report to give lenders, employers, marketers and other service providers a fuller, more complete 360-degree picture of a consumer's financial life to enhance decisioning. We are working with our customers to leverage the traditional credit file that lenders already rely on to understand the financial profile of candidates for loans and services. Instead of focusing only on financial activity or delinquency over the past three to six months, our trended data and analytics allow lenders to look at delinquencies over an extended period while closely monitoring indicators of financial distress, such as utilization increases and loaning combinations. We estimate that this deeper view of traditional credit reports may allow nearly 4 million consumers who have recently moved down from prime and super-prime credit categories due to credit policy tightening to move back up. Consumers that may be good candidates for cards or personal loans who may otherwise be overlooked as lenders execute their traditional recession playbook. Even more importantly, alternative data in the form of Equifax's unique twin income and employment information has become increasingly critical as uncertain job market impacts underwriting and the ability of consumer to repay their loan. Unique data we provide helps lenders and consumers together to verify that a borrower is employed when a credit decision is made. The do-it-yourself alternative requesting hard copy employment and income verifications can lengthen process workflows and cannot be verified. We estimate that the addition of twin income and employment data into credit decisioning can move more than 7 million consumers up into prime and super-prime categories so they can receive larger loans and other services with renewed lender confidence. Telco, utility, bank transaction and commercial data are further examples of Equifax's unique and differentiated data sets. Our cloud technology transformation is delivering a single day of fabric that combines our multiple databases into one environment to enable more nimble innovation, insights and analytics, while at the same time, enhancing regulatory compliance. We have incredible appetite for new and differentiated data, and we believe and commercial data that that more data delivers better decisions for our customers. I hope this gives you a strong sense of our broad range of strategic initiatives as we are transforming Equifax for the future. Turning now to slide seven, and our third quarter financial results. Equifax continued with very strong performance again in the third quarter. I'm very encouraged by the resiliency and strength of Equifax and how our teams around the world are meeting the challenges of COVID to help our customers, partners and consumers. We are operating more effectively and efficiently with more energy and momentum than I've seen since I joined Equifax, and I believe we'll be a stronger, more resilient organization when this global pandemic is over. During the third quarter, we saw very strong revenue performance, particularly at Workforce Solutions and USIS, with broad-based improving revenue trends resulting in strong cash generation in EBITDA margins, while we continue to make incremental investments in technology and product and innovation in security. Revenue growth of 19% is the highest quarterly growth in our history, and we eclipsed $1 billion of quarterly revenue for the first time in Equifax\u2019s history, all huge milestones. I'll talk more in a minute about our financial results. We continue to make proactive customer collaboration, a key priority in order to drive engagement, deal pipelines and new product innovation. During the quarter and past several weeks, I've been engaged with our key customers. This is the most challenging environment they've ever faced. Broadly, data is more valuable today than ever and our unique data assets like TWN and Advanced Analytics are critical to helping our customers navigate through this pandemic. We continue to take advantage of our strong cash generation to accelerate our cloud data technology transformation investments. Under Bryson Koehler's leadership and with the support of thousands of technology team members, we are making continued strong progress on our $1.5 billion technology transformation, and we are seeing new customers accessing our cloud-native solutions each week as our migrations accelerate. We're also continuing to expand our investments and resources around innovation in new products that are helping our customers manage today's challenging environment, but also with an eye on -- beyond the pandemic. Our transformation into a product led organization focused on innovation and enabled by best-in-class cloud-native data assets and world class technology is becoming more real every day and will power our business in 2021 and beyond. Our team\u2019s strong execution and outperformance in the third quarter is another very positive step forward for Equifax. Turning to slide eight. Our financial results for the third quarter were strong and broad based. Revenue of was $1.07 billion was up 19% on reported in local currency basis, which is well above our expectations in the framework of 10% to 12% that we shared with you in early September. M&A contributed less than 1% in the quarter. Our growth was again powered by our U.S. B2B businesses, USIS and Workforce Solutions, which had a combined revenue up a very strong 32.5% and combined adjusted EBITDA margins of over 50%. Workforce Solutions continued their exceptional performance driven by the value of the TWN database with revenues up 57% in the quarter, while generating EBITDA margins of 58%. This marked Workforce Solutions\u2019 second consecutive quarter of 50% plus revenue growth, and USIS also exhibited strong revenue growth of 15%. Our strong U.S. B2B business performance continues to be powered by our focus on growth and our differentiated data assets. U.S. mortgage revenue was up almost 90% compared to the third quarter of 2019. U.S. mortgage market inquiries, our proxy for the overall mortgage market growth, were up 51% in the third quarter, driven by strength in both the new purchase and refinancing mortgage volumes. The driver of our U.S. B2B businesses substantial outperformance versus the market continues to be Workforce Solutions, where mortgage revenue more than doubled for the second consecutive quarter in a row. This was driven by the value that our customers place on our TWN income and employment data, the rollout of new products, the addition of new customers, improved customer penetration and expansion of our TWN data records. U.S. mortgage revenue growth of 57% also outpaced the market by 600 basis points. Our unemployment insurance claims business grew over 70% in the quarter with revenue of $50 million. In the third quarter, Workforce Solutions processed about $3.4 million initial unemployment claims, which is down from $7.5 million initial claims in the second quarter. Workforce Solutions continues to process roughly one in five U.S. initial unemployment claims. We expect unemployment claims to continue above 2019 levels in the fourth quarter, but at a reduced level compared with the third quarter. Excluding the growth from unemployment claims, which we would not expect to report in 2021, Equifax revenue growth was up a very strong 17% in the third quarter and is up over 12% year-to-date. Revenue growth drove adjusted EBITDA to $391 million, up 29%, with a 270 basis point expansion in our margins to 36.6%. We prudently balance cost controls while making target investments in our cloud transformation, new products and data and analytics. Adjusted EPS at $1.87 a share was up a strong 26% despite incurring increased depreciation and amortization and incremental cloud cost of $0.15 a share and increased interest expense of $0.06 per share from our second quarter bond offering. This exceeded our expectations in the framework of $1.50 to $1.60 we shared with you in September. USIS revenue of $386 million was up a very strong 15% in the third quarter with the M&A contribution less than 0.5%. Total USIS mortgage revenue of $179 million, was up 57% in the quarter as both purchase and refi transactions remained strong throughout the quarter and better than our expectations of up about 45% from our call last month. Non-mortgage revenue also strengthened in USIS sequentially in the quarter at down 6%, up from down 7% in the second quarter. Importantly, we saw a substantial improvement in non-mortgage online revenue, which was down only 5% as compared to almost 10% decline we saw in the second quarter. We saw a very good sequential improvement in banking, insurance, rental and direct-to-consumer, with insurance turning from down double-digits to up double-digits in the quarter. We are starting to see signs of customers restarting origination efforts with several major FI's revenue up versus 2019 for the first time in the pandemic, which is a positive sign for the future. In September, we saw positive growth in both insurance and direct-to-consumer, which although still negative, we saw improvements in banking and auto, both of which had only single digit declines. Financial Marketing services revenue, which is broadly speaking our off-line or batch business of $46 million was down 9%, consistent with our expectations. Marketing-related revenue, which represents just under 40% of FMS continue to be down significantly, but did show some improvement as we move through the third quarter. Risk decisioning, which includes portfolio review activities and represents about 40% of FMS revenue was down slightly due to a large onetime project last year. In identity and fraud related revenue, which represents about 20% of FMS was flat. I'm very encouraged by the progress of Sid Singh in the USIS teams continue to make especially during these challenging economic times. They are competitive commercially and on offense. We continue to see very strong new deal pipeline growth at USIS, with total pipeline value up over 30% versus last year, driven by growth in the volume and average size of our USIS pipeline opportunities. Larger deal opportunities are very positive sign as we look to accelerate USIS revenue growth. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins of 46% were up 160 basis points from last year and up 188 basis points sequentially. The improvements both year-to-year and sequentially were driven principally by the significant growth in high-margin online revenue. Turning now to Workforce Solutions. They had another exceptional quarter with revenue of $377 million up a very strong 57%. Year-to-date revenue is already over $1 billion at Workforce Solutions. Rudy Ploder and EWS team continue to leverage broad structural growth drivers, including new products, penetration, pricing, new verticals and record additions to fuel their above-market growth. EWS remains our most differentiated business particularly in this unprecedented consumer environment where our TWN income and employment data is immensely valuable. Verification Service revenues at $301 million was up 63% versus 2019. Verification Services mortgage revenue more than doubled for the second quarter in a row, growing more than 80 percentage points faster than the 51% growth we saw in the mortgage market, credit imposed in the third quarter. Verification Services non-mortgage revenue was up about 4% in the quarter and slightly outperformed our expectations. Similar to the second quarter we continue to see growth in government and health care as well as in the auto vertical as we increase penetration of TWN. During the third quarter, we saw a significant recovery in talent solutions, reflecting both increased U.S. hiring and the rollout of new products. Consistent with second quarter, debt management continues to be very soft. Employer Services revenue of $76 million increased 37% in the quarter, driven by our unemployment claims business, which had revenue of $50 million and was up 70% compared to last year. Adjusting for the $20 million of incremental UC claims revenue in the quarter, Employer Services was flat with revenue growth in I-9 and onboarding services that was driven by the acceleration of I-9 Anywhere solutions offset by declines in our tax credit business. Transaction activity in our I-9 and onboarding products improved through the third quarter and sequentially versus the second quarter, driven by new hiring activity with our customers. Many of the large retail shipping and e-commerce companies utilize our I-9 onboarding products. In addition, we\u2019re seeing a positive shift to our new remote I-9 product suite with new customer wins. Strong EWS Verifier revenue growth resulted in adjusted EBITDA margins in Workforce Solutions of 57.8%, a 900 basis point expansion from the prior year. Turning now to International. Their revenue of $218 million was down 5% on a constant currency basis, a substantial improvement from the down 15% in second quarter and better than our expectations as shelter-in-place orders were lifted at many markets and economic activity resumed. Asia Pacific, which is principally our Australia business, had a very good performance in the quarter with revenue of $80 million, about flat in local currency versus last year and better than the down 5% we expected earlier in September. Australia consumer online revenue was down 5% versus last year, a significant improvement from the down double digits we saw in second quarter. Our Australian commercial business, combined online and off-line revenue, was up 1% in the quarter, again, a nice improvement from the prior period. Fraud and Identity was also up over 15% in the third quarter versus the down 12% in second quarter. These areas of improvement offset declines in consumer marketing services, our consumer offline business and HR Solutions. Consistent with second quarter they continue to be down versus last year. New Zealand revenue was down just over 10% in the quarter, significant improvement to be down 25% in the second quarter. European revenues of $59 million were down 13% in local currency in the third quarter. Our European credit business was down about 7%, with Spain performing slightly better than the U.K. In the U.K, consumer online revenue was down just over 10%, a significant improvement from the down 20% we saw in second quarter. Analytical and Decision Solutions revenue was almost flat in the quarter, a significant improvement from about -- down about 20% in second quarter. Combined consumer online and analytical decision solutions represent about 75% of our U.K. CRA business. Similar to the U.S, our consumer offline business continues to show significant declines due to reductions in economic activity and credit originations. Banking revenue, driven by new wins with top 5 U.K. banks, was up over 25% in the quarter. Our U.K. banking team is seeing real momentum. Our European debt management business declined 20% in local currency, in line with our expectations, principally driven by government enacted policies that continued to temporarily halt debt collections due to COVID-19. U.K. government debt placement activities restarted in August. We expect fourth quarter debt management revenue to improve meaningfully as September debt placements were up 5x versus pre-COVID levels. Turning to Latin America. Their revenue of $40 million decreased 6% in local currency in the third quarter, better than the down 9% we expected earlier in the quarter. Importantly, our Latin America revenues were much better than the down 14% we saw in the second quarter. In the quarter, Chile our largest country in Latin America, delivered positive revenue growth. And our Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay businesses showed significant improvements from second quarter, down about 4% in the quarter versus 2019. These markets continue to benefit from the resumption of economic activity expansion of Ignite, the migration of customers to our global cloud-based interconnect SaaS decisioning platform. We're also seeing the benefit of the strong new product introductions over the past 3 years in the region. Canada revenue of $39 million was flat to local currency in the third quarter, a significant improvement from the down 13% in second quarter and in line with our expectations from our September call. Consumer online and commercial were both down about 5% in the third quarter, and both were a substantial improvement from almost 20% declines in the second quarter. Analytical and Decision Solutions were about flat in the quarter against substantial improvement from the second quarter. We delivered nice growth in Canada in our ID and Fraud business and Property Service businesses. It's combined with the improved performance of the other segments allowed us to improve to flat in the third quarter. International adjusted EBITDA margins of 32.3% were up 130 basis points from last year, despite the decline in revenue, principally reflecting benefits from cost actions taken in 2019 and strong expense management this year. Turning now to Global Solutions revenue, which was down 2% on a reported and local currency basis in the quarter. Our Global Consumer Direct business was up 6%, their highest growth since 2017. Our North American Consumer Direct business revenue was up a solid 6% versus 2019, while the U.K. Consumer Direct revenue was about flat. Importantly, we continue to see sequential subscriber growth in the U.S. and Canada, our two largest markets. Based on a continuation of these trends, we expect our Consumer Direct business to show positive revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Ben Anderson and the GCS team have done a good job returning our Global Direct business to a growth mode. Our remaining GCS business is principally our partner businesses as well as our benefits channel and event-based businesses decreased about 10% in the quarter, in line with our expectations. We delivered 11% growth in our benefits channel and event based businesses, but this growth was more than offset by declines in our U.S. lead gen partner business as originations continue to be soft in the third quarter. GCS adjusted EBITDA margins of 24.8% decreased 10 basis points compared to the prior year period due to increased marketing spend to drive future direct revenue and lower lead generation revenue, offset by onetime setup costs incurred during the third quarter of 2019 related to a new multiyear contract. Slide nine highlights the acceleration of revenue growth over the last several years and quarters, broken down between the growth drivers from the extraordinary UC claims revenue in 2020 from high unemployment and the strong U.S. mortgage revenue market to help you look through the impact of these strong market factors to the underlying Equifax core growth. As we discussed earlier in the third quarter, Equifax grew 19% overall with 200 basis points of debt [ph] growth from UC claim revenue and 11 points of Equifax revenue growth from the strong U.S. mortgage market. We are very pleased with the 6% core growth with strong sequential growth versus the minus 2% in second quarter, particularly with the headwinds from the COVID session. Equifax is clearly outperforming U.S. expectations in the COVID recession. The impact of the strong U.S. mortgage market is highlighted in purple and reflects growth driven directly by the strong underlying U.S. mortgage market. To be clear, this is not the growth of Equifax U.S. mortgage revenue, but is instead only growth directly attributable to the U.S. mortgage market itself that we estimate based on mortgage market credit inputs. During the third quarter, 11 points of Equifax\u2019s 19% growth was from the strong U.S. mortgage market. The impact of the extraordinary UC claims growth in 2020 is highlighted in blue. We are providing this given the dramatic unusual growth in the year we are seeing in 2020 that we expect to normalize overtime. Equifax core growth is in green, and reflects the resiliency and breadth of our business performance in the COVID recession. Essentially this is the sum of the growth in our U.S. non-mortgage businesses, our international businesses and GCS and growth in our U.S. mortgage businesses above underlying mortgage market growth. Excluding the impact of the U.S. mortgage market and UC claims, Equifax core growth has expanded from 2% to 3% in 2018 and 2019 during the global financial crisis to 5% in the first quarter and now 6% in the third quarter while we\u2019re still in the middle of the COVID pandemic. This performance reflects the resiliency and breadth of the Equifax portfolio. As I will cover on the next slide, it\u2019s important to recognize that in the third quarter a significant portion of the 6% of Equifax core growth is being driven by our outperformance in our U.S. B2B mortgage vertical powered by Workforce Solutions core growth, which was a strong 30% and USIS, which was only down 1% on a core growth basis. This ability to substantially outgrow the underlying market is core to our business model and a substantial strength that should continue to provide significant benefits through the balance of 2020 and into 2021. Equifax is dramatically stronger in 2020 versus the 2008, 2009 recession with revenue up 19% in the quarter and 12% in second quarter versus down 6% during the global financial crisis, again, reflecting the strength of today's Equifax portfolio. A continued strategic focus and strength of Equifax is our deep and broad array of products and solutions for the U.S. mortgage market and ability to consistently outgrow the underlying market. Slide 10 highlights this through our U.S. B2B businesses, Workforce Solutions and USIS. Both Workforce Solutions and USIS have consistently outgrown the underlying U.S. mortgage market. The driver of the acceleration of this outperformance over the past several years has been a tremendous growth in Workforce Solutions mortgage revenue, which exceeded mortgage market growth rates by over 20 points in 2019, accelerating to about 80 points of our performance this year. The key drivers of the strong Workforce Solutions performance includes increased market penetration, which, by this, we mean both an increase in the percentage of mortgage applications for which the underwriter requests an income and employment verification from Equifax and an increase in the number of times a mortgage underwriter requested income and employment verification during the application process. Both of these drive increased TWN inquiries. As we view U.S. mortgage marketing -- we view U.S. mortgage inquiries as a proxy for the overall market, an important metric we track is TWN inquiries as a percent of USIS credit inquiries. In third quarter, this metric for the first time exceeded 50%, where we had one TWN mortgage market inquiry for every two USIS credit mortgage marketing inquiries. This metric has been growing substantially over the past three years and has more than doubled since early 2018. However, at only 50%, it shows that we have a lot of runway ahead of us to reach the same utilization for TWN as a credit file. We are actively working with our customers to continue to drive penetration through both expanded selling efforts across our customer ecosystem and increasing customer system-to-system integrations. Second is increased fulfillment rate. This is the percentage of times we receive a mortgage inquiry that we can\u2019t fulfill and is driven by -- that we can fulfill and is driven by growth in the TWN database. While we have real scale at over 50% of the non-farm payroll database, we only fulfill roughly for 50% of our inquiries. As we add records via our immediately monetized, which provides real leverage for Workforce Solutions. Adding new TWN contributors and records is a priority for the EWS team. And third is new products. We continue to introduce new Workforce Solutions products that provide greater value to our customers in terms of depth of data and frequency of polls with higher price points in margins. We expect NPIs to accelerated Workforce Solutions from addition of new product resources and leverage from the cloud transformation. Workforce Solutions is clearly almost powerful business. Slide 11 shows their above market strong performance, which is highly accretive to Equifax revenue growth, margins and cash flow. Through third quarter, overall Workforce revenue growth of $332 million or 48% through 13 points of Equifax revenue growth and Workforce core revenue growth of $163 million contributed six points of Equifax core revenue growth versus last year. The impact on Equifax EBITDA was even more powerful with Workforce Solutions delivering $572 million of Equifax EBITDA or 44% of our total EBITDA through the third quarter. Equifax is the powerful business and important driver of Equifax results in 2020 and in the future. As shown on Slide 12, you can see the continuing growth in our TWN database, which has been a significant driver of value to our customers and the growth in Workforce Solutions. In the third quarter, we continue to add TWN records and delivered new TWN record growth of 6 million active records in the quarter, even in the high end unemployment environment, which grow TWN database over 111 million records, up from 105 million, we had at the end of first quarter and second quarter. TWN records are up has grown 20% versus 2019. We also had significant milestone in the third quarter with contributors surpassing the 1 million level, this is our million company in the United States that are contributing to payroll records at Equifax up from 64,000 a year ago, which has moved the TWN database deeply into small ended market companies. With the TWN database now providing information on over 88 million unique individuals, firmly over half of the U.S. non-farm payroll, we view this as a catalyst for Workforce Solutions, given the increasing hit rates and uniqueness of the data. As we discussed previously, the Workforce Solutions team is expanding their focus on records beyond just W-2 payroll into areas like 1099 employees to give economy and pension income. The increasing depth of the TWN database was now over 415 million total records had the additional benefit of increasing the completeness of an individual job history that we have in the database. This also significantly increases the value of the unique TWN data for both credit decisioning as well as in Talent Solutions and other applications. As a reminder, we generated almost 20% of our verification services revenue from inactive records that we built up over the past decade, which helps to provide a full picture of individual employment history. This also expands the uniqueness and value of TWN, which is other sources of income for employment data. And what has been the most challenging economic and health environment we faced in our lifetime, Equifax delivered exceptionally strong performance again in the third quarter, while investing in our cloud transformation and new products. We are focused on finishing 2020 strong, while investing for 2021 and beyond. I will now turn the discussion over to John to discuss recent trends in revenue in our growing markets as results -- as well as reducing other financial items. After John\u2019s discussion, I will come back and review our progress on the tech transformation and new products. John Gamble : Thanks Mark. I\u2019ll generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis, but we will refer to non-GAAP results as well. In the third quarter, general corporate expense was $155 million. Excluding non-recurring cost adjusted general corporate expense for the quarter was $109 million, up $38 million from 3Q 2019. Corporate function expenses, such as, finance, HR and legal were down year-to-year, reflecting the cost containment activities we outlined in April. The increase in total general corporate expense is primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs in 2020 due to our strong and improving financial performance. We continue to exercise disciplined cost management across the business, while also continuing to invest in our technology transformation, data and analytics, new products and securities. We will accelerate investments in these areas in 2020 as we believe this will deliver accelerated benefits. Outside of these areas, head count additions remain at levels below attrition, and discretionary spending has been reduced. Across the company, business travel remains at very low levels. For 3Q 2020, the effective tax rate used in calculating adjusted EPS was 21.2% and in line with our expectations. We expect the 4Q 2020 tax rate and full year effective tax rate used in calculating adjusted EPS to be around 24%. In 3Q, 2020 and year-to-date, operating cash flow of $367 million and $645 million were up $532 million and $566 million, respectively from 2019. The increases reflect the substantial improvements and operating performance in 2020 as well as lower payments for litigation settlements in 3Q 2020 and year-to-date of $341 million and $246 million, respectively. The timing of payment of the remaining $347 million to the U.S. consumer restitution fund is principally dependent on the resolution of the appeals filed related to this case. At this time, we do not expect to fund the remainder of the settlement until early 2021. Our liquidity and balance sheet remain very strong. At September 30, we had $1.5 billion in cash, and available borrowing capacity on our bank credit facility of $1.1 billion. As Mark mentioned, our 3Q results were substantially stronger than the implication of the trends through August that we discussed in our September 8 Investor Call. The improved results were predominately on our U.S. B2B business. Importantly, the improvement was in our U.S. online revenue, with significant improvement in non-mortgage revenue as well as in mortgage. We also had stronger results in international in Australia and Canada. The strength in adjusted EPS reflects the margin impact from the stronger revenue in September. Slide 13 through 15 show details of revenue trends on a local currency basis that we saw in 2Q and 3Q, as well as monthly data for July, August and September. We are also providing the view of the trends so far during the month of October, and their implications on 4Q 2020 if they were to continue throughout the quarter. For line items, for which daily trends are not available or not relevant, we did not provide monthly actuals, but did provide 2Q, 2020 and 3Q, 2020 data as well as an estimate for 4Q 2020. The monthly actuals data provided should be viewed as directional. Looking at slide 13, starting at the bottom of slide, U.S. B2B revenue growth trended very positively in September, growth into August and in 3Q 220 relative to Q2 2020 with U.S B2B revenue up 32% in 3Q 2020 year-to-year as compared to the 28% year-to-year growth we saw in 2Q 2020. This was driven by improved year-to-year growth in U.S. B2B online revenue. Mortgage year-to-year revenue growth strengthened significantly in September versus August and in 3Q 2020 year-to-year in both USIS and EWS. The stronger growth was in the context of a stronger mortgage market we saw in 3Q 2019 which grew 20% from 3Q 2018. Importantly, online non-mortgage revenue growth trends also improved meaningfully in both September and 3Q 2020. USIS non-mortgage revenue was down only 3% in September and 5% in 3Q 2020, year-to-year and EWS saw year-to-year growth and online non mortgage revenue in both September and third quarter 2020. Workforce Solutions unemployment insurance claims business grew substantially year-to-year again in the third quarter of 2020, we expect strong growth in UC again in 4Q 2020, up about 30% year-to-year. The column on the far right of slide 13 provides a view on year to year revenue growth trends through mid-October and the implications on 4Q 2020 revenue that those trends should continue. A few reminders as we look at those trends. Fourth quarter and seasonally the lowest quarter for mortgage revenue, reducing the relative mix of mortgage revenue and overall Equifax revenue. 4Q 2019 saw a very strong growth in the US B2B online, about 18% driven by very strong 4Q 2019 online mortgage revenue growth of 34%. Again, starting at the bottom of the slide 13, implication of the revenue trends through mid-October continuing throughout 4Q 2020, U.S. B2B online year-to-year revenue continues to be extremely strong. The growth rate is just under 30%. Both USIS online and EWS online verification services growth rates will be very strong, but it levels slightly below what we saw in 3Q 2020. Mortgage revenue growth rates will be slightly weaker than in 3Q 2020, reflecting the strength in 4Q 2019 mortgage revenue, particularly in EWS. USIS non mortgage year-to-year growth rates would be about flat with 3Q 2020 and workforce non mortgage is expected to decline slightly versus a slight growth we saw in 3Q 2020. Workforce Solutions employment services year-to-year revenue would be up under 15%, but the unemployment insurance payments business continues to grow, but at levels lower than 3Q 2020. Financial Marketing Services revenue would be down consistent with the levels we saw in the third quarter. Turning to slide 14 as Mark discussed earlier, international saw significant improvements in all regions in 3Q 2020 with constant currency year-to-year revenue down that only 5%. Trends from mid-October international continues to improve and so the implementation of the revenue trends through mid-October and continuing throughout 4Q 2020, we expect International revenue to be down only slightly in the fourth quarter. GCS October trends reflect the continuation of those that Mark discussed earlier. In Consumer Direct growing total subscribers are expected to lead the second consecutive quarter of global direct revenue growth in 4Q. As we referenced last quarter, the declining partner revenue we saw in 3Q 2020 is expected to increase significantly in 4Q due to decline in the lead gen related partner business. We expect the weakness in partner revenue to continue into the first half of 2021. As with our prior two earnings calls and due to the continuing uncertainties in forecasting the direction, depth and duration of the recession related to the actions to combat COVID-19, we are not going to provide fourth quarter guidance. However, the perspective on total Equifax 4Q 2020 performance, we will again provide an illustrative fourth quarter framework to help you think about our performance. Please turn to slide 15. To the extent, total Equifax revenue continues at the pace I described earlier, 4Q 2020 revenue would be up about 9.5% to 11.5%, or $84 million to $104 million year-to-year, resulting in 4Q 2020 revenue of $990 million to $1.01 billion. Adjusted EPS in 4Q 2020, these revenue levels could be in the range of $1.40 to $1.50 a share down slightly from 4Q 2019. Slide 15 also provides a walkthrough explaining the translation versus 4Q 2019 of the revenue increase to the increase in pre-tax income and adjusted EPS. Importantly, these adjusted EPS level, Equifax to deliver over $350 million in adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. [Indiscernible] guidance, there is still much uncertainty as to what impact the pandemic will have on the economy, our customers business activities, and therefore our revenue and earnings. This range provided reflects current variability and trends not a view of potential or outcomes. As I referenced earlier, trends in Equifax mortgage inquiry volume remain at record levels in the third quarter consistent with a very strong market data on originations. In addition to very strong refinancing activity, new purchase volume has been at record levels and the change was a period of 20% from last year. And as we referenced last quarter, for Black Knight estimates approximately 18 million household still benefits from refinancing at current average 30 in mortgage rates of under 2.9%. For perspective, current estimates of refinance originations in 2Q 2020 were under $1 million per month. As Mark referenced earlier, we continue to look to accelerate the completion of our tech transformation, including increasing investment levels in 2020. At present, we expect 2020 onetime cost related to the Equifax 2020 Technology and Data Security Transformation to be about $340 million. We expect capital spending to be about $410 million for the full year. As a reminder in 2021, we will no longer be adjusting our financial results for one-time costs related to the cloud technology transformation. The one time technology transportation costs are expected to decline substantially in 2021 and will likely be largest in 1Q 2021 decreasing throughout the remainder of 2021. These one-time technology transformation costs will impact development expense, G&A and COGS. We will continue to disclose these one-time tech transformation costs to allow you to have comparability with our financial results from 2017 through 2020. And with that I'll turn it back over to Mark. Mark Begor : Thanks, John. I\u2019ll wrap up with an update on our cloud technology and data transformation and our accelerated focus on new products. Turning to slide 16. Equifax continues to make very meaningful progress on our cloud data technology transformation. We\u2019re energized by the revenue, cost margin and cash benefits we expect from our cloud investments. Through a single cloud native data fabric and common cloud -- global cloud based infrastructure, to be able to innovate, to develop more robust Product Solutions and multi-data insights that are portable around the world enabled by our differentiated cloud data technology to be able to unlock new use cases and verticals, with our solutions for new and existing customers. Our cloud based infrastructure will also enable us to accelerate the velocity at which we can develop new products from months to weeks. Accelerating the benefits our customers receive from these products in driving our revenue growth. We\u2019re already starting to see increased system availability as we move from our legacy technology into the cloud and we expect this trend to continue. All the non-capability are table stakes and global technology company we believe that as more customers moved to the cloud -- the cloud operability will deliver best-in-class systems availability, and customer interaction seamless and faster. And lastly, we\u2019re continuing on our path to being industry leader in data security. Our security is core to everything we do that by advancements in data governance. We know that data security is a battle that we must fight alongside our industry peers and our customers every day. Starting to slide 17, we moved in the final phase of our North America technology transformation with a focus on customer migrations. We continue our progress to migrate our customers into our new cloud based systems, including our InterConnect Ignite and API capabilities. As a reminder this is the common set of services on which we are working to migrate all USIS, EWS and International customers. At the end -- as of the end of the third quarter, USIS has migrated over 4800 U.S. customers, and Internationals completed migrations of about 6500 customers. For USIS it is up about 4x from the about 1200 customers migrated at the end of June. We continue to expect this pace of migration to accelerate in the fourth quarter with over 10,000 U.S. customer migrations expected by year end with the remaining U.S. customer migrations completed during 2021. We continue to adapt our development priorities at platform capabilities to use our customer\u2019s ability to easily migrate to our new platforms. Our progress on the transformation since our last earnings call in July is positive. Initial and draft migration to GCP of our major North American exchange data to U.S. and Canadian consumer agro [ph] risk exchanges, the world\u2019s number in [Indiscernible] is principally complete, and we expect to have completed full migration including all data ingestion processes for these exchanges by year end. This distinct milestone with this exchange is generating about 70% of North America Online revenue. We\u2019re also making very good progress in the full migration to GDP, our secondary U.S. exchanges, the U.S. and Canadian commercial risk exchanges, property and data exchanges. These exchanges are expected to be to complete full migration as we move through 2021. Investments in Europe by TAM and Australia in deploying cloud native Data Fabric and our Ignite Interconnect API analytical decisioning framework are also progressing well. Data Fabric is live in six global cloud regions globally. We completed the initial migration of our eID identity validation system in the third quarter and started customer migrations, which we expect to complete by year-end. In our Luminate Cloud Identity [Indiscernible] it is now available to customers in the U.S. and Canada. And in eID cloud-native service is also available for U.S. as part of our newly transformed cloud Luminate offering. Additional data sources will continue to be integrated on a regular basis as we move forward. We still have plenty of work in front of us, but we are making strong progress in our cloud data and technology transformation. We remain energized about the future top and bottom line benefits. Our cloud-native data and infrastructure will differentiate Equifax in the marketplace today, and be even more valuable as we complete the transformation. Planning [ph] team highlights our expanded new product innovation focus, which is a key component of our EFS 2020 strategy in the next chapter at Equifax. As I mentioned earlier, we are focused on transforming our company to a product led organization and powered by best-in-class cloud-native data and technology to fuel growth. As we progress through 2020, we continue to make strong progress on our goals to expand our NPI rollouts, and are on track to deliver about 110 new products in 2020. Through September, we launched about 85 new products, and we have an active pipeline in various stages of the funnel. In the third quarter, we continued our strong focus on recession based product launches, including our response recovery, product offering, which provide lenders and service providers, the data and analytics they need to both care for their customers and ensure the long-term health of their portfolios. Response recovery enabled by our night market intelligence sandbox provides lenders access to point in time and trend to consumer insights in order to make better underwriting decisions during a period of economic instability, as well as get the information they need to reach out and support their existing customers already in a combination situation and other institutions. In USIS, we continue to build on our strengthening commercial business. In the third quarter, USIS launch B2B Connect, designed to help enterprises better prospect, segment and retain key business clients with intelligence on more than 150 million global companies, including 53 million U.S. businesses and 80 million B2B contracts. B2B Connects is providing an extended omni-channel view of businesses, businesses companies need to better qualified commercial prospects and improve engagement with existing customers. The commercial B2B product will be further enhanced by data from our recent acquisition of Ansonia, which brings unique commercial leasing data to our already robust set of commercial assets At Workforce Solutions, we continue to focus on the hiring process. This is as a significant growth opportunity for our business, as there are more than 70 million new hires per year in the United States. In the third quarter, Workforce Solutions launched the first -- the industry\u2019s first I-9 management service designed specifically as an e-commerce platform in the small and mid-sized business owners aligned. For years, large enterprise businesses have put their trust in the market leading I-9 management solution from Equifax. Now with the e-commerce launches of our I-9 starter and our I-9 standard packages, Equifax makes it easier than ever for businesses of any size to be manage their I-9 requirements. With an automated I-9 platform, organizations can have more confidence in their onboarding and I-9 compliance and deliver better onboarding experience for the new hires. Workforce Solutions also continue to innovate and uses new solutions to both support their financial and mortgage verticals in 2020, including our new mortgage trended income, employment and multi-borrower products. NPI continue to be an important lever for Equifax growth and a priority for me and the team. We\u2019ve expanded our focus and resources on driving NPI loss in 2020 and more recently, with a global focus on products that support our customers during the COVID recession. We will continue to prioritize new products and innovations as we move into 2021 to leverage our cloud data and technology transformation for future growth. Wrapping up on slide 19, as John outlined earlier, we\u2019re still unable to provide guidance for the fourth quarter. We still see meaningful uncertainty from the impacts from the COVID pandemic as cases rise and many markets impacting shelter in place orders, consumer confidence and economic activity. There\u2019s also a real risk of the second COVID wave and potential increased lockdowns. We also expect further impacts from our employment, furloughs and salary reductions. But even in this challenging COVID environment, Equifax is operating exceptionally well. Our strong business model is resilient in delivering while investing in the future. As we look forward to the rest of 2020 and towards 2021 and beyond, we are confident in the drivers of our business model into our growth strategy. Our strong 19% growth in the third quarter affects the breath and resiliency of the Equifax business model. The strong U.S. mortgage market and UC Claims revenue was delivering incremental revenue, margin in cash that allows Equifax to continue to be aggressive about investing our cloud transformation, while expanding new investment in innovation, new products in D&A. Our strong results also strengthen our balance sheet to allow us to focus on accretive M&A. Our third quarter closed 6% revenue growth exclude the impact of U.S. mortgage market and US Claims revenue, a very strong performance in the COVID environment, with our non-mortgage in international business is still pressure from the COVID recession. We expect those markets to recover in the future with the roll-out of a broad based COVID vaccine as markets recover and economic activity improves. Workforce Solutions is clearly a franchise Equifax business that is strongly outperforming with multiple structural growth levers from new records, new product, improving product mix with new motor multiples and incremental poles driven by the growth in system and system integrations. While the mortgage market is a positive tailwind this year for Workforce Solutions, they underlined 27% core growth year-to-date excluding the impact of UC Claims and the mortgage market reflects the power and breath of the Workforce Solutions business model. Their multiple structural growth levers give us confidence in our ability to drive future incremental value for our customers and future revenue growth for Equifax. And the addition of 6 million records in the third quarter will drive revenue growth in the future. Our new SSA contract, Social Security Administration contracts that will begin generating $40 million to $50 million of annualized revenue starting next year is another feature of Workflow Solution growth driver. We are also seeing enhanced and broadened value of unique twin income and employment data given the scale and depth of the database. Turning it to USIS, they also have a strong quarter lead by growth mortgage. USIS has done offense in winning in the marketplace. USIS revenue is outperforming in the COVID recession with total third quarter growth improving to down 1%, excluding growth in the U.S. mortgage market. The USIS mortgage business continues to outgrow the market with nine points to core growth in third quarter, up from six points in the second quarter. Importantly, USIS pipelines remains our highest levels since 2017 from a new commercial focus and rollout of new products. As we look out beyond the impacts of the COVID pandemic, we believe that our non-mortgage revenues, which historically represent about 70% of USIS revenue are poised to growth, USIS is competitive in winning in the marketplace. Our international business has a well balanced portfolio of global businesses representing over 20% of Equifax revenues that have historically driven top line revenue growth through new products and analytics. Unlike our U.S. B2B businesses, most of our international markets do not have mortgage businesses, and therefore not have seen a larger decline in revenue growth in 2020. From the deeper COVID recessions in more severe GDP declines that have also impacted growth. We began to see recovery and International markets in the third quarter with Australia and Canada flat versus last year, and expect to see continued improvement as economic activity resume forward. And last, our GCS Direct business is poised for continued growth behind our disciplined investments. Our B2C [ph] businesses are improving as we invest in new products and marketing and we surpassed 7 million My Equifax members in the quarter, which is a sizable base to cross-sell financial products. Since I summarize, we're making very good progress on our cloud transformation and data transformation, with significant milestones being achieved on customer migration accelerate. We are energized about the significant top line cost and cash benefits that will come from this transformation, including always on stability, speed to market, ability to rapidly move products around the globe, which we expect will help us improve our position in the marketplace. And last, our balance sheet is strengthened in 2020 from our strong performance, allowing us to be aggressive about investing in our index 2020 Cloud Data and Technology Transformation, new products and data security, while looking for creative bolt on acquisitions that will add to our strategy. As we continue to deliver above market results in the COVID recession and focus on investing for future growth, I'm more excited than ever about our future as a market leading data, analytics and technology company. With that operator, let me open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Kyle Peterson with Needham. Kyle Peterson : Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to start on the margins. It looks really strong this quarter, especially within EWS and others have been kind of marking up over time. Do you think what we saw on the margin side could be sustainable in monolized environment? Or is there anything like one-time that we should be thinking about from this quarter? Mark Begor : Yes. It's a great question. You've seen over the last several years, and certainly in 2020, strong top line performance from Workforce Solutions and that has certainly translated into margin growth. As you know, in our industry, internet business in particular, but in all our businesses incremental revenue growth drives very attractive incremental margins. We've seen a very strong performance in 2020. We expect that this is to continue to perform in the future. And I think we're prepared to give a guidance around margins for the future, because we can't do that broadly. But we've got a lot of confidence in the Workforce Solutions business, given the multiple levers that they have to drive future growth. Kyle Peterson : Got it. That's helpful. And then just one follow-up. I know you mentioned the [Indiscernible] increase, now that you're talking about one inquiry in twin for every two or just like mortgage origination inquiries. What do you guys find is the biggest gating factor to getting that moving that ratio higher. Is that more like lender awareness of those database or is it just that you just need to keep pushing the snowball down the hill and adding more employers and records onto the network? Mark Begor : Yes. It's less about the employers and records. It's really what you pointed out. It's really getting into one of our customers and showing them the value of the product. It's also driven by new products. We talked about in the last couple of calls that Workforce Solutions is rolling out new products that provide multiple polls and a package for mortgage application as one purchase from Equifax. And we see that driving some of the polls. We also see the system and system integrations being a real driver, where we're getting embedded in our customer workflows. And we've got a dedicated team that works on that with our customers to show them the value of the income employment data. And then, as you pointed out just getting in front of customers, so they understand, the lift they're getting in predictability. If you're a mortgage originator, and you're going to spend, call it $4,000 in a mortgage application. When you start that application process, you want to make sure that you're working with a customer that is going to be able to be approved. Part of that is historically pulling the credit file upfront to understand what the credit profile of that customer. And that's kind of a common practice today, increasingly, the more sophisticated mortgage originators are starting to pull upfront, the income employment data, particularly in this environment, understanding where are people still employed and then pulling it multiple times. So those are just multiple opportunities that the team has in using mortgage as an example. And, of course, the same holds in other verticals where we're seeing, particularly the database becomes almost a catalyst, it's over -- well over 50% of the non-farm payroll, it's becoming an asset that the hit rates are very valuable in multiple verticals beyond mortgage. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Manav Patnaik : Good morning. Maybe I can just follow-up there. The mortgage digitalization, I guess, is the big team out there. And we're seeing a lot of acquisitions for my Equifax. There's a whole bunch of stuff going on out there. And I just, besides, trying to get more penetration, the way you just described it, like how do you look at the opportunity with that team? And do you have plans with other solutions, and the name. Would you just talk there would be helpful? Mark Begor : Manav, I apologize, I miss the first portion of the question. Can you give us a quick reference? Manav Patnaik : Sure. It was tied to the team around mortgage digitization, I guess, and there's a lot of opportunity striving from that. And I was just wondering if you had broader plan for your mortgage business outside of just kind of seen a little bit more penetration that you just talked about? Mark Begor : Yes. Obviously, we have a large mortgage business. We're benefiting from the market tailwinds. We've got a real focus on rolling out new products, in particularly Workforce Solutions, but also in the USIS, our UDM products, are another growth area for us. And I think what we're pleased with is the fact that both USIS and Workforce Solutions are outgrowing the mortgage market. Now, how do you do that? Will you do that with new products, new solutions, blogging more usage of your products, in particular, that's around the twin income employment database were pulled more frequently. And then just the system, the system integrations where we still have a lot of one way to work with our customers to convert them from dialing in and keying into the system on an individual applicant basis to pull the income employment data to go into system integrations, which is as you know is more on the credit file side. But it's one that's an opportunity on the income employment side. And that really we've seen big lifts in utilization, when we are embedded in the workflows and the income employment data. We've had great progress in adding those in the third quarter in 2020. Manav Patnaik : Got it. And then just a check on the Tech Transformation. When you started the program, you're talking about $1.25 billion is the number and it's a pretty big number you talk maybe you left some buffer room in there. But last time you said 1.4, and I think you said, it was a 1.5 billion program. So I was just curious, that incremental 250 million like, I guess where did we go over budget? Or where's that extra spend are being required today? Mark Begor : Yes. And that's been an area that we've been clear that we're going to invest more. We see opportunities to do that to accelerate the transformation. And just to be clear, and I know you notice, but $1.5 billion we now talk about is the incremental spend in 2018, 2019 and 2020. So that's going to be behind us. And that's how much we're going to spend through the end of the year. We'll obviously be spending money on our technology as we go into 2021 and beyond that, that's going to be in our one rate spend versus the incremental spend that we talked about. And with our strong financial performance in the second half of 2019, we started investing more in the Tech Transformation. And as we continued in 2020, and performed so strongly during the COVID recession, we've made strategic decisions to accelerate our spend in order to drive it more rapidly. We think that's the right thing to do, because of the sizeable benefits that we expect to get from the transformation. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Andrew Steinerman : Good morning. Just two questions. The first one I didn't catch if you gave the total Equifax third quarter revenues related to mortgage. So, I'd like that if you could. And6 then looking at slide 13, under EWS, non-mortgage, September stood out to me how it jumped forward. And then, sort of October kind of normalized back to July, August rates. Could just talked a little bit about that September come forward? Mark Begor : So, in terms of total mortgage revenue, total mortgage revenues are little over a third of Equifax total revenue. So that's the best way we'll estimate that. In terms of September non-mortgage for EWS, we have substantial business with government and other participants. And so it can just be a little choppy. And obviously, the underlying revenue base isn't that large. So just movements between months can result in different growth rates between the months quite understood, so that's why we indicate that when you're looking at those numbers you can consider them indicative. And that's why we focus a lot more on the quarterly numbers. Andrew Steinerman : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Toni Kaplan : Thanks so much for taking my question. Just wanted to ask broadly about how you're thinking about the trends in consumer credit. On one hand, we've heard some lenders talking about borrowers, more borrowers exiting forbearance, and defaulting, which could impact the appetite for lending. But on the other hand, you have recovery trends taking hold and the economy with things opening up. So wanted to hear broadly about that? And specifically, also just wanted to ask about the sort of better September non-mortgage number within USIS. And then October getting a little bit more in between like, where September and the other months of the third quarter are? John Gamble : The first half of the question, Toni, it\u2019s obviously complicated. It\u2019s a -- economic event, a health event, like we've never seen before. Kind of broadly, the consumer is still fairly strong. Obviously, there's high-end employment, but some of the stimulus benefits that help the consumer. When we talk to our customers, their delinquencies, they are not increasing yet, because they're making minimum payments, and they're not behind in credit card payments, et cetera, kind of I'm talking broadly. So I think that's kind of what's happening so far. I think what we're all watching, is what happens as stimulus dollars one out. Are they're going to be using dollars, either pre or post the election in a few weeks, its tough to see. Where's unemployment going to go? Yes. And on top of that, what's the timing of vaccine? How quickly will it be deployed across the population, which obviously will drive economic activity. It's just a lot of challenging messages there we try to work through. What's underlying that, from our perspective, is that data is more valuable than ever for our customers. And that's what we're seeing. Obviously, our performance is quite strong. Data is being used to try to look through to who are the customers, the consumers that are still working. Who are the consumers that can take a line increase or having a mortgage refi or what is the data? So I think that's a positive for our industry. But you point out, which is why, we struggled providing guidance for the fourth quarter of 2021. At this stage, it's still quite uncertain about where that consumer is going. Mark Begor : In terms of your question on September at minus three and in the quarter minus five and our discussion around mid-October at above minus five. Again, the above minus five and above minus three to us are very similar numbers, right? And September's monthly data. So I think the important fact is we are seeing an improvement trend. We expect that we're seeing our business improve in non-mortgage, and we're very happy with that trend. But as we look through the rest of the fourth quarter, above 5% is can be a little bit on either side of 5%. Operator : Our next question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI. David Togut : Thank you. Good morning. And appreciate all the helpful disclosure in the deck. The number one investor question I receive on Equifax is whether revenue and earnings growth is peaking given this extraordinary mortgage market expansion, which clearly benefits both USIS and EWS, along with the increased appetite for TWN employment and income data during the COVID pandemic. And clearly there are a number of positives that will sustain, the 20% growth and TWN records, the growth in NPI, the growth in the pipeline. But as you start to think about a 2021 framework, you want people to start with that 6% core growth from the third quarter. What are some of the parameters that you're starting to think about as you frame your own views for 2021? Mark Begor : David, I think we're going to try to avoid getting you to 2021 guidance, but we were quite intentional because we're getting the same questions you're getting about what -- how do we look through Equifax is very strong performance in the year, particularly from the incremental UC claims revenue, which is meaningful, that we've highlighted will likely normalize in 2021 with unemployment, presumably coming down our unemployment claims not continuing. And then, of course, the U.S. mortgage market. U.S. mortgage market, that's one that is difficult for us to -- John talk a little bit about that one. We can't forecast what's going to happen in 2021 on the mortgage market, but the fundamentals are still quite positive for 2021 in the U.S. mortgage market with the Fed stating pretty strongly that they're going to keep interest rates at the record lows through 2021. That's a positive for refinancings and for purchase volume. We've seen purchase volume really accelerate in the last 90 days in the United States. Consumers are going out to buy homes or upgrade to get larger homes or move to the suburbs. And again, we're not forecasting, but it feels like there's some legs on that macro. And then of course, the refinance side, there's still a very sizable population, as John pointed out by consumers that have not refinance their mortgages yet, that there's multiple quarters of that benefit. With regards to 2021, you highlight some of the positives for Equifax. You can start with a lot of businesses are still challenged by the COVID pandemic and we're not forecasting 2021. But if you believe that there's going to be a vaccine, and the vaccine is going to result in more normal recovery of some sort, that's going to be good news for Equifax. International, our non-mortgage businesses in the United States, more RTGS business. So that's a positive as we go forward. You point out the power of Workforce Solutions. As we entered the pandemic USIS within a recovery mode following a cyber-event, we believe USIS is performing quite strongly on a mortgage and non-mortgage basis during the pandemic. But as we get into more of an economic recovery, we expect that to accelerating as exhibited by the deal pipelines are growing and the needs increased commercial activity. And of course, Workforce Solutions, we tested to really highlight how important that business is, how important is performance is. They've got a long list of structural levers, that they can -- that they're bit pulling and will continue to pull and you pointed our records, 6 million addition in the quarter is going to serve them well with higher hit rates and drives higher revenue in the fourth quarter and into 2021. And of course, the other elements of the business. So out attempt in providing the additional disclosures this quarter was to help you and our investors, see through the underlying performance in the COVID recession. And again, we're still in a COVID recession, Equifax delivering 6% core growth is really quite strong. And the tail winds, if you add on top of that, the benefits from the Tech Transformation as we talked about the very clear will begin really kicking in 2021, which would be another positive for us on both our top line margins and cash generation. David Togut : Appreciate that. Just a quick follow up on capital return. Will you be in a position to do more in terms of capital return as we approach 2021 in terms of dividend growth by that more M&A? John Gamble : Yes. We've been clear that, again, I don't want to give guidance. And as you know, we don't have a financial framework in place. But we've been pretty clear that our goal to get back to that. We've been investing heavily in our Tech Transformation. And we're getting the big spend in our Tech Transformation, certainly behind us in 2020. And our three-year plan. And we believe that our cash generation will accelerate as we go through 2021, 2022, 2023, which is going to provide free cash flow for us to invest in M&A, which we talked about earlier in the call. It's our intention to have more focus there. And we don't want to give any guidance around. Our intent to do a buyback or reads a dividend growth. But we've had that framework in place before. And we'll certainly consider its a right time when we put our financial framework and capital allocation plan back in place in the future. Operator : Next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Thank you. I just want to spend a minute on the progression of the client in EWS. Ultimately, it looks like the average client size was about 4,000 back in 2008. And that number is closer to 110, based on just specific next kind of client versus records in the work number. Do the needs of the smaller clients kind of increase? And is there any way to frame what the opportunity is as you kind of triangulate from the dollar perspective, kind of the work number with the core USIS as you look at a little bit. So just trying to get a sense of, again, the market opportunities as you build more down market, and then what that can meets the enterprise overall? Mark Begor : Yes. First off on, more records is more value, right? And more contributors is doing, they are moving up 6 million records this quarter. We think is a big milestone where we were flat in the second quarter. But there's some bumpiness to when records come in, and we had a very strong order of execution there. We're up 20% in records year-over-year. As you know, that's going to drive hit rates and revenue growth going forward. And then to your point, you did see really the addition of some more companies. There's all kinds of numbers out there on how many companies there are in the United States, whether it's three or four or five million, but going from 69,000, a year ago to a million companies really does increase the breadth and depth of the database. So that's very, very positive for Equifax and for our customers. As you know, one area where the database is huge, is what I would call, the near-prime or sub-prime customers, and you see those customers and all kinds of companies, but adding more companies, million companies just brings more value to the database. And we're really intently focused on continuing to grow the database. We also mentioned earlier in the comments that getting to this level of scale, having 88 million uniques, or 107 million active, as well as inactive, really takes the database almost as a catalyst of being very, very valuable just because they hit rates go up. And the other thing I've commented on is that the team is expanding their focus. We've had a W2 focus on non-farm payrolls for a long, long time. And in the last year, we started to expand that focus around the gig economy 1099 that we're actually ingesting now into our database, 1099 income data. Pension data is another one that we've got our sights set on for those. We're going to hit towards non-farm payroll, that's going to take time. But we've expanded our focus to go well beyond that to get all levels of employment or other income that consumers are having. So it will become really one stop shop for all that data. Kevin McVeigh : Got it. And then just to follow-up on that real quick. I know, obviously, the focus been on the mortgage side, seems like there's a opportunity to flush that out across other credit instruments as well? Is that so? Mark Begor : It is. That's a big focus for us and we talk on prior calls that the values always been there. And we shared with you and others that if you take credit data, and add income employment data to what the predictability or the chaos for from that decision goes up dramatically. So that's always in the back, it's one that we've been sharing with our customers for years. The COVID crisis has created a catalyst for that. And we talked about in the last call. On the second quarter call that we're seeing, for example, credit card customers. We've got a couple of major credit card customers that are now embedding the work number data into their origination workflows, so adding it to the credit file. So that's a big deal for us to get into that space. In the auto space it\u2019s been used in closing for sub-prime customers, and now we're seeing it used more broadly because it increases the predictability of that underwriting decision. And so, it's really around our focus on differentiated data. But of course, the twin income and employment data is just very, very unique in that scale, which provide real value and of course, we didn't talk about it in this call, that government is also was very fast growing vertical for us. I talked about the new social security administration contract that extend in 2021. That's an example of how we're expanding the use cases of the twin data. And then of course, another growth area for us around the data is in employment decisions. When you're hiring someone, we call it talent solutions. So that's another area that we see future growth. So there's just a lot of levers for growth in that business. Operator : Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. Ashish Sabadra : Well, thanks for taking my question. And thanks for the clarification on the FMS. My question -- follow up question there was, when does that difficult comps form a big client and last year anniversary and when do you start seeing FMS get back to a more normalized growth profile? Thanks. Mark Begor : Sorry. You're breaking up a little bit. Could you repeat that question. Ashish Sabadra : Oh, sorry. Sorry about that. My question is on FMS. There was a difficult comp there. I was just wondering when does that difficult comp anniversary? And when do we get back to a more normalized growth in the FMS business? Mark Begor : Yes. So your questions about the FMS business. First off, we're still in the COVID recession. And you know, that business provides data for both portfolio management and marketing. And as I pointed out my kind of say, John did too, lot of our customers have curtailed or slowed down, do account originations which affect their business. And so, when you talk about normalized growth, the first thing, or the biggest factor that's going to drive that will be a resumption of originations, which we started to see. We kind of did that. And we had a couple of customers in the quarter in September that started to originate -- started origination, and actually had origination volumes without -- revenue with us that were above last year. So we're starting to see signs those originations. John pointed out, we also add some a couple of larger deals if you will in 2019. And I would attribute that some part of the USIS recovery that haven't repeated in 2020. I would characterize most of that is driven by the COVID recession and the impact decisions our customers are making around assumption on originations. But we all know that our customers will start originating again, once their confidence grows, they have to -- that's a part of your business. You have to continue to add new customers. So it's just a matter of when they start doing that. And we would expect the business to grow there. On the portfolio management side, that's one where we've seen some increased activity. As customers are focused on managing the back book, we would expect that to continue to be a positive tailwind as we move into fourth quarter of 2021. Its typical as you're coming out of the recession, or in a recession, there's a lot of focus around managing your existing portfolio. Ashish Sabadra : That's very helpful color. And maybe just a quick follow up on the cost savings. Thanks for those details. I was wondering could you have a timeline by which we should start seeing those savings flow to the bottom line? And any incremental thoughts on how should we think about investments going forward? Thanks. Mark Begor : That's one that we're not ready to get 2021 guidance, we're not giving guidance on. It is our plan to provide some visibility in the future -- in the near future around what we expect some of the benefits to be in 2021 as we have some level of framework for 2021. We're not sure we're going to be able to provide guidance. But we'll definitely do that. We're not ready to do that today. That said, we have been quite clear around what we expect the benefits to be, the sizing of the cost benefits that we're going to get from the cloud transformation, the cash benefits we expect to generate, which we believe are sizable. We haven't framed yet. We expect the revenue benefits to be -- those will all be firmly embedded in a long term framework when we put it back in place. Operator : The next question comes from George Mihalos with Cowen. George Mihalos : Great. Good morning, guys. And thanks for taking my questions. I guess first to kick things off. Mark, I think you said that about 20% of verification revenues coming from inactive accounts. And I'm just curious, how long can an inactive account could be monetized? What's sort of the lifespan of an inactive account? And then, does that really skew to one vertical within EWS more than any other? So for example, mortgage where you're bundling services or something like that? Mark Begor : That's great question. One, we haven't talked a lot about, 20% is a big percentage of our revenue. It's really going to -- every vertical has different use cases were having a multi-year period, multi-year history of someone\u2019s employment is quite valuable. There\u2019s a use case, which is someone working today, and how much did they make. And then there\u2019s other use cases as well, that they\u2019ve been working for the last 12 months, they have been working for the last two years. And as you know, people change jobs. So having a, multi-year, or a multi-job work history for someone is quite valuable. We have something like an average of 4.5 jobs per unique individual in the database, which makes sense. There\u2019s a lot of people that change more often over a five-year period, six-year period, two-year period than others, and then some that are in the same job. But that history of data is incredibly valuable. And there\u2019s some use cases where you have to have the history. So not only having what someone is doing today is less valuable, which really go down the path of like a someone who\u2019s going to provide a pay stub, that might work in some situation, most of our customers don\u2019t take those anymore. But would you have a use case, if someone wants to know, where did you work for the last two years, the only way to really prove that, and get it quickly and completely and accurately is to come to Workforce Solutions. So that\u2019s a wide data and if you go around verticals, it\u2019s really in every vertical, it\u2019s mortgages got a lot of use cases where it\u2019s very, very important to have a history of work, employment and income, auto has it, card, less so, all of those use cases where some card issuers are looking at that. In the government space, it's valuable, both today as well as history, and it just reflects the value of the business. It\u2019s taken as a decade to build up that 450 million records on individuals, it\u2019s just very, very valuable. George Mihalos : Okay. That\u2019s super helpful color. Really appreciate it. And then just as a quick follow-up, I think obviously, within GTS partner is under increased pressure. And yes, I think if I caught the comments, you were suggesting that it will stay weak through the first half of next year. I\u2019m just curious if you could talk a little bit about the visibility that you have in that channel of the business going forward? Mark Begor : Yes. I think we said during the first half of last year, I think we said we expected it to stay soft through the fourth quarter. We don\u2019t have visibility, just to be clear. But in our discussions with customers in that space, which is really in the lead generation space, it goes back to the origination point I had earlier around our USIS FMS business, customers, originators, whether your bank card or personal loan, clearly curtailed in the COVID recession, their origination. So that impacts our business and also impacts some of our partners to use our data in that Lead-gen space. So that'll come back over time. We don\u2019t know what it is. It\u2019s hard to forecast. As we look out to the fourth quarter, we expect it still to be weaken the fourth quarter on the Lead-gen side, just because we don\u2019t see signs. We see signs of improvement, but not to where it was a year ago. George Mihalos : Okay, great. Thank you. I misheard that one. Operator : Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Hamzah Mazari : Hey, good morning. Thank you. My first question is just on the tech transformation timeline. Anyway to think about the risk that that timeline bleeds into sort of 2022 with COVID? Mark Begor : Yes, we\u2019ve been pretty clear on all of our calls during the COVID recession that, we\u2019ve been meeting our milestones. And we think that don't change our plans. And we talked a bunch on the call this already this morning around -- etcetera being in the cloud. So we\u2019re very pleased with our milestones. We\u2019re also very pleased with our migrations, remember just two people detect transpiration. One is getting the technology right and getting our data assets and application to the cloud. And then second is migrating our customers to waiting. So you saw that we\u2019re making good progress in the third quarter. And we expect to make good progress in the fourth quarter. So, we\u2019re pleased with our progress, and there's still a lot of work to do, but we are meeting our internal milestones that we\u2019re trying to share with you transparently. John Gamble : And we compare that the focus is on North America, which is like 80% of the revenue. And we have indicated that some smaller properties or smaller business would trail out further into the future. But that will just become normal spend. Hamzah Mazari : Great. That\u2019s very helpful. And you just want to follow-up on the mortgage market, specifically. Just on Fannie and Freddie any potential changes there, under either administration either more autonomy, new capital rules, privatization. Just any chatter on Fannie and Freddie and how that may impact you? Or is that not really a big deal? Thank you so much. Mark Begor : Yes. We don\u2019t -- that there\u2019s a lot in that question. You get into what can happen, the elections versus Democratic versus Republican that you got to get into all that set in etcetera. I think that\u2019s probably a longer question. But I would say more broadly, specifically to Fannie and Freddie, we don\u2019t see any change in impacting Equifax if administration changes or not with Fannie and Freddie. Frankly, more broadly we don\u2019t see that how Equifax operates. We provide a very valuable service to U.S. consumers and to our customers. And we don\u2019t expect them to change whatever happens in November. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Bill Warmington : Good morning, everyone. So this new I-9 product you guys introduced last week that takes the I-9 Management Suite down market to the small and midsize businesses. I realized that\u2019s part of the Employer Services, but and non-verification services. But is a strategy to use the I-9 product as a source of new leads for the work number? Mark Begor : We like our talent solutions and Employer Services business is a compliment to our verification services business. And for us the idea of having more connections and services, with the HR manager who was providing us in making a decision to provide us their payroll records for the verification side of the business we think is positive. So, there\u2019s no question, we want to continue to expand, the services and products that we provide. On the I-9 side, we introduced a number of I-9 products that we\u2019re really pleased with in their performance on an I-9 anywhere that allows the expected employee to complete that process remotely, using a digital solution and in some of the smaller company products that we\u2019ve introduced. It\u2019s just examples of our focus on innovation and new products, hope to drive the business but to expand our relationship as I would characterize it with the HR manager. So we have more connections for the broader ecosystem that were for solutions. Bill Warmington : Got it. And as a follow-up question. Just wanted to ask on the social security contract, that\u2019s starting up next year, the 40 million to 50 million in revenue, any additional color on the timing of the start of that revenue beginning of the year, middle of the year, something? Mark Begor : Yes. Too early on that one. We certainly expect revenue in 2020, which is why we\u2019ve talked about it that way. A full run rate is going to be to $40 million to $50 million. It likely won\u2019t be full run rate for sure in 2021. But we\u2019re actively working on the technology elements with our customer and driving it forward. We talk about this contract just because of the size of it. It\u2019s unusual to have a contract of that size get landed. But it\u2019s just a reflection of the value of the Workforce Solutions data in so many different verticals and use cases in this case and the government space with the Social Security administration. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities. Andrew, you may have us on mute. Andrew Jeffrey : Hi, guys. Appreciate you taking the question. It\u2019s been a long call, full of good information. Mark, I just wonder if you could address Equifax\u2019s position in Fintech. I know it's one of the areas in COVID that\u2019s maybe been a little bit weaker than some of the structural growth areas that you enumerated, but maybe a cyclical outlook there and also market share plans and outlook would be helpful. Mark Begor : So, I think, we\u2019ve been clear, it\u2019s a space that we refocused on and started building out resources in the latter part of 2018. We added resources in 2019. I think from commercial resources, we\u2019re up probably between 2x and 3x what we had two years ago. So it\u2019s a space we want to be bigger in. We think we are well positioned to be bigger in it. We have pretty strong market position with most of the Fintechs with our TWN data where it\u2019s used, and of course, it\u2019s expanding usage during COVID. And we are working to take advantage of that relationship to move some of our credit data in. We\u2019ve had some positive wins. It\u2019s, I don\u2019t know, $250 million market in the United States. I think you know our competitors are much stronger than we are. But we think there\u2019s room for Equifax to grow. Many of those are single-sourced in the Fintech from starting out that way, and they\u2019re getting to scale where they could be dual source, which prevents an opportunity for Equifax, particularly when we\u2019re already in the door with our TWN data. They have been more impacted than how we characterized an FI, particularly because of their funding requirements. They typically aren\u2019t balance sheet funded. So they\u2019ve been more impacted on originations. But we stayed supporting them, and we\u2019re continuing to have some commercial wins during the last couple of quarters in that space. And it\u2019s an area that, since saying in the USIS team we are focused on, for growth in the future. We see it as a strategic market for us going forward. Andrew Jeffrey : Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : We'll take our next question from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Andrew Nicholas : Hi. Good morning. Can you speak to the potential for competitors to replicate certain aspects of the work number database in the U.S. over a longer time frame? It certainly seem unlikely that they\u2019ve had the same level of integration with employers and the same number of employers. But are there other ways to gather some of the same data aspects, whether it be through some of the payroll processors or analyzing demand deposit accounts? I guess, I\u2019m just wondering, how you protect your moat there and whether alternative approaches to gathering income and employment data could result in alternatives for your customers down the road? Mark Begor : Yes. We think we have real scale in the business, which provides a competitive advantage for us at Workforce Solutions. We\u2019ve owned this business for over a decade. And we\u2019ve invested between the acquisition of business and what we\u2019ve invested in technology and resources, a couple billion dollars over the last 10 years. And the scale of the business, we think provides some real strength in the competitive advantage. We talked about the history of the data, which is really hard to get, on an individual, worried about people or work the last two years or here at Equifax, where do you work the two years before that or the two years before that, collecting that data is quite challenging. We\u2019re participating in some of the other ways to collect data, you pointed out, bank transaction data and trying to impute it in, the net pay in someone\u2019s bank account that\u2019s a data source, but very difficult to get, the consumer have to consent to give the data. So we think that -- quite challenging. So we think there\u2019s just a lot of strengths around the business, we\u2019re always looking at who our competitors are in every business. And but this is one where we think we have similar market strength, given the scale of it. Maybe as you point out, the network of connections we have with so many customers. And then of course, we\u2019re now having a billion companies to deliver data to us on a fee per unit basis. And that makes this data set very, very valuable and tough to replicate. And if you\u2019re a company, you\u2019re likely not going to give the data to two companies. You\u2019re going to give it to the company that\u2019s been here for a long time. And we think that\u2019s another important element for Equifax, our strength of the business, our proprietary and security around it, the fact that we authenticate anyone who uses the data before they\u2019re able to use it. There\u2019s just a lot of security and protection around that, which is very important to those actually to own the data and contributed to us. Andrew Nicholas : Got it. Yes. That makes sense. Thank you. And then switching gears a little bit on my follow up. So maybe you can speak to the margin performance in the international business in the third quarter? Margin expanded quite nicely year-over-year, despite the revenue decline. So I was just wondering if there\u2019s anything you point to specifically on the cost front in that segment, and they are now permanent [ph] some of those savings could potentially be? Mark Begor : Yes, we did some costs work in International in 2019 that we\u2019re getting benefits from. And then there\u2019s been some tightening during 2020, during the COVID pandemic, as you point out, with pretty strong performance on margins. Given the revenue declines, which are still quite substantial in International because of the COVID pandemic. So, we expect those -- the COVID pandemic to get behind us economic activity improves that obviously, revenue should go with that and improve it, should be positive for the margins of that business going forward. Operator : We will take our next question from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Jeff Meuler : Thank you. Good morning. So, John, I think you tried to print this question with the bridge you gave us on the slides. On the Q4 illustrative framework, EPS being down slightly on low double-digit revenue growth, it looks like a lot of the headwind factors are calling out in your bridge have been with you kind of all year. Yet, you had good EPS growth year-over-year, the first three quarter, so anything else to call out on Q4 EPS in the framework? John Gamble : Yes. The only other thing you see, you see although it\u2019s a little bigger than it\u2019s been in some of the other quarters, right? And that\u2019s really driven by the fact that the comment I made around corporate expenses, you\u2019re seeing a significant increase in incentive compensation because of the fact that the business has performed so incredibly well over the past two quarters. Our expected performance has improved quite significantly, and you\u2019re seeing that across different areas of incentives, including sales comp, etcetera, and that\u2019s affecting the fourth quarter because of the very, very strong performance. We continue that -- we continue to be spending related to the tech transformation and some of that\u2019s flowing through on tech expense, but those are the biggest drivers. The other thing that you\u2019ll see, and it\u2019s a footnote on the chart, right, is tax rate is actually higher in the fourth quarter, right, year-on-year. So that negatively affects -- that negatively affects the comparison as well by $0.03 or $0.04 a share. So those factors together are what drives the difference between the revenue growth and the EPS performance. Jeff Meuler : Okay. And then I\u2019m struggling to understand the magnitude of the change in trends in the Q4 outlook for the GCS partner channel. Is this all about kind of activity at the lead-gens and member count not being backfilled yet on the churn side? Or was there any loss of partners or any changes of terms with sizable partners pricing or how they use you? Mark Begor : Yes. There's a number of things in there, Jeff. And there certainly is \u2013 we\u2019re always working with our customers to help support them in tough economic events. So I think you can attribute that to changes in perhaps pricing and things like that. But then there\u2019s also the underlying volume is quite challenging, which is also a contributor as their customers and, of course, in our case, with our FMS business, still are not anywhere near pre-COVID levels with regards to originations. Jeff Meuler : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. George Tong : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Mark, you mentioned that core revenue growth was 6% in the quarter, excluding benefits from unemployment claims in the mortgage market. Can you talk a little bit about what may be driving the difference between the 6% core revenue growth and non-mortgage B2B revenue performance in the quarter that was roughly flatted down? Mark Begor : I think if I follow your question, it's really going to be the outperformance of our mortgage businesses, which is Workforce Solutions is growing -- obviously, the mortgage market is up. As we highlighted on couple of slides in our comments, they\u2019ve got core growth in the mortgage business. So that\u2019s going to drive that. And the same with USIS at 600 basis points of growth in mortgage from core versus the mortgage market and Workforce Solutions multiples that from new records and new products, everything else. So that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving it now, which we think is very positive in a COVID recession. And of course, the rest of the non-mortgage businesses at Equifax that are still negative in many markets and verticals because of the COVID recession, those surely will recover as economic activity comes back in the future, as we get through and past the COVID market effect. John Gamble : As Mark indicated, you\u2019re right, George, I mean it\u2019s our strategic focus to try to make sure we dramatically outgrow the mortgage market. And what that\u2019s showing is that we\u2019re achieving that very successfully even though the non-mortgage businesses are weaker because of COVID. George Tong : Got it. And looking at monthly trends, specifically in the non-mortgage business, USIS revenue has been largely consistent at down roughly 5% year-over-year moving through the quarter, and the non-mortgage EWS also consistently down about low single-digit if you exclude that jump that we saw in September. So, could you talk about some of the puts and takes around that to our non-mortgage revenue performance in 3Q that didn\u2019t seem to improve moving through the quarter. But the trend seemed relatively stable, so just some picture on that. Mark Begor : I think it\u2019s really about those verticals really still not recovering and we expect they will. I think our competitors are seeing similar challenges with -- whether it\u2019s card originations or personal loan volume. The financial institutions are being quite conservative and that should be until they have some clarity around where the economy is going. When they do, they\u2019re going to start originating again and that will be positive for us as we go forward in our non-mortgage businesses. John Gamble : But to be clear, we did see improvement in September in the USIS non-mortgage relative to what we saw over the July, August period. It certainly did better. And we saw that improvement. We talked a little bit about that in the script. And the same is true in EWS. I think it did better. When I asked the question, I was simply trying to indicate don\u2019t expect 16% to continue, right. But we did see an improving trend both in USIS non-mortgage and EWS non-mortgage during the period. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Securities. Gary Bisbee : Hi. Good morning. Thanks. So I guess just to partner on innovation if I could. You have actually talked at the beginning of the tech transformation about the opportunity to decelerate innovation. I would love to just get a sense where you are with that and have you made enough progress that that is happening and if it is more of a for future opportunity, what is the timeline? And I guess the second part of that, the previous Equifax talked a lot about the concept of vitality and even use to talk annual classes of new products and sort of how the three year company forecasts for revenue on those were doing. Could you just help us think through that as well? Obviously went down from [Indiscernible] growing again is that a meaningful acceleration of innovation really that vitality going forward? Thank you. Mark Begor : As you know, for the last couple of quarters you\u2019ve heard me talk about it because I really view it in the next chapter with Equifax really, accelerate our new product innovation. It\u2019s really levers the cloud investments that we\u2019re making. We believe that this is going to be a real catalyst for us to drive topline growth. You\u2019re seeing an EDS about the timing and you know it\u2019s really happening in 2019. We did it on the chart, we put in the in the early slides, we did 90 new products out from 16 in 2018. And that\u2019s up from in the 70 to 80, range, kind of pre cyber events. So in 2019, we\u2019re operating at higher level. And of course, we\u2019ve gone to 90 last year to around 110 in 2020. So there\u2019s clearly a renewed focus on it, you saw a few months ago, we brought in a new Chief Product Officer. We\u2019re adding new product talent resources to really scale up our ability to bring new products to market. And remember, one of the reasons we\u2019re making this cloud investments that we talked so much about it, because we\u2019re going to put all our data assets into a single data fabric. And we believe that\u2019s going to accelerate our ability to do data combinations and renew solutions to the marketplace. So that\u2019s what this new product team is going to be focused on is really leveraging the cloud investments that we\u2019re making. So what you're going to see benefits of it, you're seeing it today, you saw this quarter and we talked about some of the new products we're rolling out in the marketplace. That gives our commercial team more things to sell, and more solutions to bring to our customers. So going from 90 last year to 110 and my goal is to grow beyond the 110 in 2021, as we continue to invest in resources, and really leverage the cloud transformation. With regards to the vitality index, that\u2019s something that we've talked about before, I guess pre the cyber event. I think it\u2019s likely something we\u2019ll bring back to the dialogue with our investors. We already have plenty to talk about. But if there\u2019s interest in that, you will certainly bring that back. But new products are a key priority of ours. As I characterize it, it\u2019s the next chapter with Equifax, it\u2019s really going to drive our top line growth. John Gamble : And I mentioned this before, but absolutely our products that are launched on the new infrastructure that are benefiting us already. And Mark talked about Luminate in his script and other fraud products. That's certainly the case, eID we talked about. So, kind of the broad fraud suit is running on new infrastructure. And then we also talked about effect of the COVID response products that were built specifically on the new infrastructure, and then we couldn\u2019t have done otherwise. So, those are some examples. There are certainly more. And we are seeing benefits from it and we expected to dramatically accelerate as we get into the first quarter. Gary Bisbee : Thank you. John Gamble : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Brett Huff with Stephens. Brett Huff : Hey, thanks. This is a long call. So I\u2019ll just be quick. You talked a little bit about the analytics as one strategy and then unique data is another strategy. And I think we talked a lot about unique data today with EWS. Can you give us an update on sort of the next major phase of the analytics development you guys are thinking about, as we think about the economic recovery, not a position Equifax for that next phase of growth? Mark Begor : Yes, there's a number of drivers there Brett that we\u2019ve talked about over the past couple of quarters. It starts with our Ignite, an analytics sandbox, I think, we've invested heavily in that, and we\u2019re rolling out in the marketplace. And that\u2019s a tool for our customers to access our data as well their own and really drive analytics and solution that will result in use of more of our data. So that\u2019s very, very positive for us. And of course, we have a large DNA team that is focused on creating new solutions. And we talked about some of those that really are from our analytics about combining data assets that increase the predictability in some of our COVID response products, to help our customers look at using trended data to understand how our customer outperformed in the past, to use that to create predictability to how they\u2019re going to perform in the future, adding income and employment data. Those are all part of our analytics to deliver a solution. And they result in more usage of our data or specific revenue opportunities and new scores or other ways that we deliver the analytics to drive the predictability of the decision for our customers. And we believe the cloud investments are really going to advantage us in more opportunities to bring new solutions from our DNA to the marketplace. Brett Huff : Great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, guys. Thank you for squeezing me in over here. Wanted to talk a little bit about the competitive environment, how you guys are doing outside of the mortgage markets in terms of like win rates and pipelines? I know John you comment about the pipeline being strong, is this kind of void space where you're able to go into it\u2019s like unique data, like the work number and credit card, or straight out and compensation are you guys kind of winning more outside the mortgage. Can you just kind of comment on that and if there\u2019s anything quantitative you can share? Mark Begor : Yes. John shared some comments around our deal pipeline in USIS, which is your focus in orders that EWS pipeline is quite rich, as you might imagine it is an international DTH. But there is a lot of focus by our investors and/on Equifax, which is why we talk about the USIS deal pipeline in particular, the desktop dramatically over what it was last year and the year before, we're seeing increasing mid rates, you know, when I've used the term did \u2013 the USIS is a competitive marketplace now. In the COVID recession, that's harder to see, because you\u2019ve got the pressures of the economic impacts from our customers, on Equifax and on USIS, but we see the deal winds coming into the global recession, you saw the kind of strength of USIS revenue, non-mortgage numbers, using that in particular in the second half of 2019 and coming into the first quarter of 2020. And we seen competitively, during the recession -- the COVID recession impacts of the second quarter, third quarter, the USIS is performing quite well. So we still got a lot of confidence in that business and its recovery. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay, thank you. Operator : And that concludes today\u2019s question and answer session. I would like to now turn the conference back to Mr. Hare for any additional closing remarks. Dorian Hare : I just want to thank everybody for joining the call and for their interest in Equifax. I just also want to let everybody know that we will be around today and in the days and weeks ahead to answer any follow up questions that you might have. So once again, thanks for joining and this does conclude the call. Operator : And this concludes today's presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Equifax Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dorian Hare, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Dorian Hare : Thanks and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I am Dorian Hare. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com. During the call today, we will be making reference to certain materials that can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website under Events and Presentation. These materials are labeled Q4 2020 Earnings Release Presentation. During the call, we'll be making certain forward-looking including first quarter and full year 2021 guidance to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2019 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. Also, we'll be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our website. In the fourth quarter, Equifax incurred a $31.9 million restructuring charge related to right sizing the organization as investments in technology transformation are reduced in 2021, as compared to 2020. Also in the fourth quarter, Equifax change its method for accounting for pensions to recognize the measurement of benefit, obligations and plan assets to earnings annually can cease delayed recognition of gains or losses caused by changes in discount rates, or other extra value assumptions such as mortality, and planned asset actual versus assumed returns. All prior period GAAP and adjusted financial information has been revised to reflect the change. Pension expense in prior years is improved by the elimination of the amortization of accumulated prior losses. For 2020, excluding the annual remeasurement impact, I will reference in a moment, this benefit was approximately $17 million to net income or $0.14 per share. In the fourth quarter of 2020, this benefit resulted in an improvement to net income of $4.3 million or $0.35 per share. The annual remeasurement occurs in the fourth quarter of each year and is recorded in other income on the income statement. This annual remeasurement will be treated as a non-GAAP adjustment as it is non operational in nature. Pretax mark-to-market adjustments resulted in the pretax gain of $4.8 million in 2019 and the pretax loss of $32.2 million in 2020. The details of this change in pension accounting are included in the fourth quarter 2020 earnings press release on slide 25 of the 4Q 2020 IR slide deck and will also be included in the 2020 report 10-K. Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark. Mark Begor : Thanks Dorian. Before I address Equifax's strong fourth quarter in 2020 results, I want to take a moment to thank our 11,000 employees and families who have supported them with a tremendous dedication they showed under the challenging COVID environment during 2020. We continue to make the health and safety of our employees a top priority and I hope you and those close to you remain safe. Turning towards to slide 4, I wanted to start with a review of our business model, growth strategy and cloud investments that positions to win in the marketplace. Our highly unique and diverse data assets are at the core of Equifax's differentiation in the marketplace. We have data assets of scale that our competitors do not have. Our acquisition this week of Kount in a global identity and fraud and AccountScore for UK open banking and data categorization are examples of accelerating focus and expanding our differentiated data assets and capabilities. Expanding our differentiated data assets through organic actions, partnerships, and M&A continues to be a priority. We and our customers are benefiting from our investment over the last three years in our new Equifax cloud native technology footprint, which enabled the creation of our single data fabric and rapid implementation of best-in-class cloud based tools and capabilities. We accelerated our new product rollouts and revenue in 2020 by leveraging our new Equifax cloud and Equifax cloud native footprint is enhanced our ability to integrate new partners and acquisitions into speed the recognition of synergies, as we believe only Equifax can. Our cloud infrastructure will differentiate Equifax in the marketplace and drive our revenues and margins in the future. Data Security is deeply embedded in our culture. And we have made tremendous progress towards our goal of being an industry leader in security. We will be relentlessly focused on a customer first mentality, which moves us closer to our customers with a focus on delivering solutions to help them solve their problems and grow their businesses. And lastly, with the acquisition of Kount in our investments in the Equifax Data Fabric, we've taken substantial steps forward towards building a leading identity and fraud business while expanding our market coverage to include retail, ecommerce and transaction based markets alongside our traditional FI telco insurance markets.  Moving now to slide 5 and spoken before that key market macros that we believe are positively impacting information service industry, and Equifax. First, the dramatic acceleration of the digitization of consumer and commercial customers facing transactions and our customers' internal infrastructure with clearly accelerated during Covid, which drives rapidly growing requirements for data and insights around identity, authentication and fraud. Second, accelerating adoption of advanced analytics and machine learning is driving increasing needs for differentiated data. Third fintechs and alternative lenders are driving innovation, growing share and accelerating this digitization macro which drives data usage. Fourth, increased need for robust identity validation and fraud prevention capabilities and digital transactions is also driving data requirements. And fifth, the explosion of data drives increased requirements for data governance by our customers and control of data by consumers. These macros clearly accelerate demand for broader differentiated data assets, alternative data sources, increased requirements for data recency and integrated insights. Equifax is very well positioned to address these trends as we build on the depth of our Equifax cloud data assets, and our capabilities to deliver advanced Equifax cloud data management, and continue to leverage our Equifax cloud data and technology investments. In USIS, the depth of our assets across credit alternative credit with DataX telco and utilities with NCTUE and consumer asset data with ISI has long been Equifax strength. Workforce Solutions TWN data is our most differentiated data asset with coverage of 90 million unique individuals in the United States. EWS is expanding between data set while broadening their point focus beyond W2 income to include 1099 and other income and employment data. At the same time, EWS is broadening beyond TWN income and employment data with partnerships to deliver individuals education, licensure, and other data to our customers to use in the hiring process. With the additional Kount broad and massive scale of digital consumer data assets, including phone numbers, email and IP addresses. Equifax data assets extend substantially as your capabilities across identity and fraud globally.  Moving now to slide 6, we believe the identity validation and fraud prevention markets will deliver strong long-term growth for Equifax and that it combined Equifax and Kount are very well positioned to deliver new and differentiated solutions to this large and fast growing marketplace. E-commerce was up over 20% in 2020 alone, while online banking was up 67% and mobile wallet usage increased 56%. And fraud is a huge and growing issue with our customers transactions have shifted from cash to digital, along with increased real time payments. Online credit card fraud hit nearly $6 billion last year with 40% of ecommerce merchants reporting an increase in chargeback fraud, and over 40% of merchants say their digital fraud slows their innovation and growth. The digital market macro clearly accelerated during COVID and we see it continuing to expand. The combination of Equifax and Kount can protect these new distribution channels while evaluating high risk transactions on a real time basis. Balanced fraud with the user experience, serve as a growth platform for customer ecommerce activities while simultaneously enabling trust and confidence. Both Kount and Equifax will leverage to be extended predictability of our combined data. And Kount brings Equifax into the fast growing ecommerce and retail markets. And last, Equifax wins Kount into the banking, finance FinTech, telco and insurance markets. The scale of counter data assets, including 32 billion in your consumer interactions, 255 million identities, 400 million addresses and a billion unique devices combined with Equifax's scale data assets is a powerful combination in this fast growing market. Advanced Data Analytics, AI and machine learning capabilities are more crucial than ever before in preventing frauds. The first suite of Kount products including its next generation AI and machine learning model, combined with the cloud based Equifax Luminate platform which orchestrates multiple solutions with machine learning, and our patented NDT AI technology will provide risk managers with insights only Equifax can give across the consumer account lifecycle. Kount also provides account takeover protection and transaction dispute management, two capabilities which Equifax did not have before to address heightened cybersecurity and fraud payment activity. We were energized to close the Kount acquisition yesterday, and to have the Kount team joining Equifax and the strong growth potential the combined Kount and Equifax in the fast growing identity and fraud marketplace. As you see on slide 7, while Kount is clearly our most sizable transaction in recent years, as we ramp up our bolt-on M&A focus to expand and strengthen Equifax's capabilities and close two other transactions in recent days focused on decisioning and alternative data. We acquired the minority position we did already own of creditworks in Australia. creditworks is a low cost, flexible, modular trade credit decisioning platform that targets the SME segment, which is a key growth driver for activities in the region. In the UK we acquired AccountScore, our partner in the UK open banking solutions and a provider of bank transaction data categorization analytics and consent technology. AccountScore has also a license in the UK where open banking is accelerating. Importantly, its capabilities will be integrated into our interconnect and Ignite platforms. We're investing our 2020 outperformance and leveraging our strong balance sheet and cash generation with bolt-on M&A is central for future growth strategy. And our cloud data and technology platforms allow us to more quickly integrate acquisitions and drive synergies. Continued expansion of our data assets and capabilities through acquisitions is a priority for Equifax in 2021 and beyond. Turning now to slide 8, Equifax performance in 2020 was very strong with sequential improvements in both total and core revenue as we exited the year. Our business model is resilient in delivering in the challenging COVID recessionary environment. We're energetic about our momentum as we enter 2021. Revenue in 2020 was $4.1 billion, up 17% with organic growth of 16.3%, is the first time we've delivered over $4 billion in revenue and the highest annual organic revenue growth rate in our history. Adjusted EBITDA was just under $1.5 billion, up 25%. And EBITDA margin was 36.2%, up 240 basis points. Adjusted EPS at $6.97 was up 22%. We delivered double digit revenue growth in all four quarters of 2020 with 23% total in organic growth in the fourth quarter, a record for Equifax. We executed on our investments to accelerate and leverage our Equifax cloud data and technology transformation, including migrating more than 47,000 customers as at the end of the year, onto our new Equifax cloud services. Leveraging is now our new cloud infrastructure we delivered a record 134 new products while decreasing our NPI development time by one third. 134 NPI, we're well in excess of the 100 anticipated coming into 2020 and above 120 we discussed with you in December. As we continue to leverage our new cloud capabilities we expect to accelerate revenue growth for new products in 2021, a key driver to our long-term growth expectations. We're energized about our 2020 performance and we're already seeing the momentum of our only Equifax model leveraging our new cloud capabilities as we move into 2021. Turning to slide 9, fourth quarter revenue at $1.12 billion was up 23% on a reported and local currency basis, which is one of our expectations in the framework of 17.5% to 20% that we shared with you in early December. M&A contributed just under 1% in the quarter. Our growth is again powered by our US b2b businesses, USIS and Workforce Solutions with combined revenue of a very strong 36.6% and combined adjusted EBITDA margins of 50%. As a reminder, EWS and USIS are now over 70% of Equifax revenue and 80% of Equifax business unit EBITDA, their combined contribution to Equifax is up 700 basis points in revenue, and almost 750 basis points in EBITDA versus 2019, which is very powerful for the future of Equifax. Importantly, international also had a strong quarter delivering 3% revenue growth, and over 34% adjusted EBITDA margins outperforming our expectations in revenue, while maintaining strong control over costs. Fourth quarter Equifax adjusted EBITDA total $422 million, up 31% with a 215 basis point expansion in our margins to 37.8%. This margin expansion was delivered while making continued investments in our cloud transformation, new products and data analytics that will drive future growth. Adjusted EPS at $2 per share was up a strong 28% versus 2019 despite incurring increased depreciation and amortization, and incremental cloud costs at $0.16 a share and increased interest expense at $0.05 a share from our second quarter bond offering. The $2 per share EPS exceeded our expectations in the framework of $1.75 to $1.85 we shared with you in early December. USIS revenue of $387 million was up a very strong 17% in the fourth quarter with M&A contributing less than 0.5%. Total USIS mortgage revenue of $153 million was up 60% in the quarter while mortgage credit inquiries grew in line with our expectations increasing 55%. USIS mortgage revenue outgrew the market by 500 basis points driven by growth and share gains, marketing and new debt monitoring products. Non-mortgage revenue performance strengthened substantially in the quarter and was just below flat improvement from down 6% in the third quarter and down 9% in the second quarter. Importantly, non-mortgage online revenue grew slightly in the quarter versus the 5% and 11% declines we saw on the third and second quarters respectively. Banking, ID and fraud, commercial, insurance and direct-to-consumer all showed growth in fourth quarter, which is a positive sign for the future. Autos fourth quarter decline at 5% was an improvement in the third quarter decline of 7%. Non-mortgage online revenue strengthened further by 5% growth in December and 6% growth in January. Banking ID and fraud, insurance and direct-to-consumer drove the growth in December and continued into January. We also saw auto returned to positive growth in January. Financial marketing services revenue which is broadly speaking offline or data business is $70 million in the quarter down about 2% which was up sharply from the third quarter, which was down 9%. The relative improvement in the quarter was driven by double digit growth and identity and fraud related revenue. We're also seeing improving trends in marketing related revenue which was down under 10% in the quarter. As a reminder, marketing related revenue represents about 40% of FMS revenue identity and brought about 20 and risk decision about 40. USIS team continues to drive growth in their deal pipeline with the fourth quarter up 15% driven by growth in both the volume and size of new opportunities. Fourth quarter win rates finish the year at 2020 times, switching into team or on offense in the USIS and winning in the marketplace. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins of 43.5% in fourth quarter were down 160 basis points from last year which was principally driven by a much higher mix of mortgage revenue and mortgage products in the quarter. Margins were also impacted by redundant systems costs and investments in new products. Turning now to Workforce Solutions, they had another exceptional quarter with revenue of $406 million of a very strong 62%. EWS finished the year with revenue of $1.4 billion and extraordinary accomplishment compared to their 2019 revenue of $950 million. Customers found incredible value in Workforce Solutions unique TWN income and employment data assets and new products. While the team's focus on penetration, pricing, new verticals and record additions drove growth. EWS remains our most valuable and differentiated business with revenue growth rates far in excess of the rest of Equifax and highly accretive margins. Verification service revenue and Workforce Solutions at $330 million is up 70% versus fourth quarter 2019. Verification services mortgage revenue more than doubled versus the prior year for the third quarter in a row growing almost 100 percentage points faster in the 55% growth we saw in mortgage market credit inquiries in the third quarter. Verification services non-mortgage revenue was up about 15% in the quarter up substantially from the 4% growth in third quarter. During the fourth quarter, we saw significant growth in talent solutions primarily driven by new products introduced in the second half of the year. We also saw strong growth in card and auto. In cards, we've added to two major customers that now use the work number broadly in the origination process. In auto, we're also seeing the expansion in the use of the work number in subprime loan approvals. We again saw strong growth in government verification services growth in January, continued strong levels delivered in the fourth quarter. And product services revenue of $77 million increased 35% in the quarter driven again by Unemployment Claims business which had revenue of over $50 million, up 73% compared to last year. In the fourth quarter, Workforce Solutions processed about 2.6 million initial claims which are down from the 3.4 million in the third quarter. EWS continue to process roughly one in five US initial unemployment claims. And as a reminder, we expect our UC claims revenue to decline in 2021 as initial Unemployment Claims reduced from record 2020 levels. Employee services, non UC claims business and revenue down about 6% in the quarter, strong revenue growth in I-9 and onboarding services that driven by the acceleration of our new online Anywhere solutions is more than offset by declines in workforce analytics and our tax credits business. We're seeing a positive shift to our new online Anywhere product suite the new customer wins at much higher price points. We expect employee services nine UC business revenue performance in the first quarter to improve relative to fourth quarter and returned to growth in the second quarter as we move towards a more normal environment. Strong EWS verifier revenue growth resulted in adjusted EBITDA margins of 56.2%, which was an over 900 basis point expansion from the prior year, which reflects the power and uniqueness of the TWN dataset.  Turning down now to international, their revenue of $242 million is up 3% on a constant currency basis in the quarter, a significant milestone is the business unit returned to growth after very challenging second and third quarters. This was nicely above our expectations from early December. Asia Pacific which is principally our Australian business had very good performance in the fourth quarter with revenue of $77 million, up about 4% in local currency versus last year and better than yet slightly we expected in early December. Australia consumer revenue was down about 5% versus last year, a significant improvement from the down 10% we saw in the third quarter. Our commercial businesses combined online and offline revenue in Australia is up 3% in the quarter. Again, a nice improvement from the up about 1% in third quarter. And fraud and identity was up almost 20% in the fourth quarter. European revenues of $79 million were up 4% in local currency in the quarter, our European credit business was down about 3%. A significant improvement from the down 7% we saw in the third quarter. The improvement was driven by Spain which saw revenue growth of 7% in the quarter. UK revenue was down about 8% in the quarter similar to third quarter. Our European debt management business grew about 20% local currency in the fourth quarter as the UK Government restarted collections activity in late September. However, following the COVID measures put in place in late in the fourth quarter by the UK Government to address the pandemic, debt collections were again halted late in the year. We expect debt management revenue to decline in the order of 10% in the first quarter reflecting these actions but to improve once vaccine are more widely distributed and we return to a more normal mode. Latin American revenues of $46 million declined about 2% in fourth quarter in local currency in line with what we expected, which was a significant improvement from the down 6% we saw in the third quarter. Positively Chile, a largest country in Latin America delivered revenue growth in the quarter. But America continues to benefit from the expansions at Ignite and the migration of customers to our global cloud based interconnects SaaS decisioning platform. And we're also seeing the benefit of the strong new product introductions in the region over the past three years. Canada revenue of $41 million was up about 3% in local currency in the fourth quarter, which was also a positive. Consumer online was down just over 5% in the quarter similar to the third quarter, improving growth in analytic and decision solutions ideally broad drove the growth in Canadian revenue in the quarter. International adjusted EBITDA margins at 33.8% were up 150 basis points sequentially, but down 260 basis points from last year. It declined versus fourth quarter last year was principally driven by redundant systems cost from cloud investments in low income and minority investments. Global consumer solutions revenue at $76.9 million was down 13% reported in local currency basis in the quarter as we expected. Global consumer solutions performance was very strong in our Consumer Direct benefits channel and events states businesses, and they collectively grew over 10% on a combined basis in the fourth quarter. The decline in overall GCS revenue in the fourth quarter was driven by our US lead generation partner businesses. As we discussed previously, our US lead generation partner revenue was significantly impacted by the COVID recession that began in the second quarter. The declines in this revenue increasing through the fourth quarter as banking customers cut back on lead gen spending. Accordingly, we expect declines in total GCS revenue in the first quarter just over 50% similar to fourth quarter levels. We expect a decline in total GCS revenue due to lead generation declines to moderate substantially as we move into the second quarter. Our global Consumer Direct business, the business in which we sell directly to consumers through Equifax.com which represents about half of total GCS revenues was up strong 9% in fourth quarter, the highest growth rate since 2017. Our North American Consumer Direct Business revenue was up a solid 10% versus last year, and we continue to see sequential subscriber growth in the US and Canada, our two largest markets. Our GCS Consumer Direct business will principally complete migrating their customers onto the new cloud based platform renaissance in the first quarter. This will allow for a new field focus on new product and service introductions to consumers in the second half of 2021. Our benefits channel and events based businesses which now represent about 10% of global consumer also delivered about 30% growth in the quarter. GCS adjusted EBITDA margins of 20.9% were down about 610 basis points principally reflecting the increased platforms spend as they complete their cloud systems migrations, increase marketing spend to drive future direct revenue, and the lower lead generation partner revenue we talked about. Slide 10 provides an updated view of Equifax core revenue growth. As a reminder, core revenue growth is defined as Equifax revenue growth, excluding number one, extraordinary revenue growth in our unemployment claims business in 2020, and 2021. And number two, the impact on revenue from the US mortgage market activity as measured by changes in total, US mortgage market credit inquiries. Core revenue growth is our attempt to provide a more normalized view of Equifax revenue growth to you, excluding these UC and US mortgage market factors. In the fourth quarter Equifax core revenue growth, the green section on the bars on slide 10, was up a very strong 11%. This is up to significantly from the 6% core revenue growth we delivered in third quarter due to strong Workforce Solutions in USIS outperformance where they continue to deliver mortgage revenue growth rates well in excess of US mortgage market credit inquiries, and a significant improvement in revenue performance from our non-mortgage business in the US, as well as the return to growth in international. A critical level in our ability to deliver high levels of core revenue growth is our deep and broad array of new products and solutions for the US mortgage market. And the ability to constantly outgrow -- consistently outgrow the underlying market. Slide 11 highlights the strong core growth performance and mortgage for our US b2b mortgage businesses Workforce Solutions and USIS. EWS in the USIS outgrew their underlying US mortgage market significantly in 2020, with a combined core growth of 37%. This outperformance was driven strongly by Workforce Solutions mortgage revenue, with core growth at 80% in 2020, which exceeded mortgage market growth rates by an outstanding 80 points during the year. The key drivers of the strong EWS outperformance include increased market penetration, larger fulfillment rates, new products and records. EWS has a long history of outgrowing their underlying markets. USIS also delivered strong core revenue growth mortgage in 2020, the growth exceeding the market by 8% driven primarily by new debt monitoring solutions, with further support from marketing. Our ability to substantially outgrow underlying markets is core to our business model in a substantial strength that should continue to benefit Equifax in 2021 and in the future. Turning now to slide 12; Workforce Solutions continues to deliver outstanding results and is clearly our strongest and most valuable business. Workforce Solutions total revenue grew sequentially during 2020 to 62% in the fourth quarter, and 51% for the year. More importantly, core revenue growth also accelerated throughout 2020 with core growth at 37% in the fourth quarter, up from 30% in the third quarter and 27% for the year. This outperformance and sequential improvements reflects the uniqueness of between data and the power of the Workforce Solutions business model. Rudy Porter and his team have built a business with strong, long-term growth levers and they continue to demonstrate the value of their scale and differentiated TWN income and employment data, is depth breadth and scale of between database and over 20,000 customer verification network and value of the Workforce Solutions and core service offerings are driving substantial growth in value. In 2020, Workforce Solutions reached 114 million active TWN records an increase of 10 million active records during a difficult period of high US unemployment. Of these 114 million active records over 60% are contributed directly by employers to Workforce Solutions that the team has built up over the past decade. The remaining 40% are contributed through partnerships, many of which are exclusive. Also in 2020, TWN reached over 1 million in core contributors, a significant milestone. As we have a dedicated team focused on TWN record additions and expects to add records again in 2021. Just last week, we signed a new exclusive partnership with a major payroll provider, that we'll be integrating their payroll system with Equifax with their work number later this year. As we're able to monetize record additions instantly from our strong network over 20,000 verification customers. And of course, the uniqueness of the TWN data. Rudy and his team continue to rapidly expand the number of mortgage companies and financial institutions with whom we have built real time system to system integrations. As we talked previously, those derive more usage of our TWN data. In mortgage for example, full 65% mortgage transactions are now system to system Workforce Solutions. These integrations are now extending into our verticals, as well as across our growing government business. We also expect our new verification solution for the Social Security Administration to go online in the first half of this year, which will deliver incremental revenue for Workforce Solutions. The Workforce Solutions new product pipeline is also rapidly expanding with new products across mortgage. channel solutions, government, and I-9, a new product revenue expected to increase substantially in 2021 and 2022. In 2021, Workforce Solutions verification service infrastructure will be fully cloud native, also providing the industry's leading cloud native data and technology platform that will further accelerate data ingestion, massive additions of employee contributors to the clean database, and new product capabilities to this unique and scale TWN data asset. In slide 13, I'd like to turn into 2021 and discuss some of the favorable market and macro trends that I alluded to earlier. Before Covid, the macro trends on the left hand side of the slide had already begun to manifest themselves. As I discussed earlier, COVID driven a rapid acceleration of digital and online consumer interactions, improve real time decisioning require more complete, and more recent information from the broader set of data assets, including alternative data sets has become even more critical. This is required to reduce friction in consumer transactions while ensuring certainty of identities and minimizing credit and fraud risk. Effectively utilizing these expanded requirements for data decisioning has accelerated the need for advanced analytics, including machine learning, as well as the need for effective data governance including the ability to provide consumers with acquired control, and seamless delivery of these capabilities continues to advance. High Performance is always been table stakes in the space that we play in. Given these accelerating and continuing trends, the implications for Equifax are that the gain for our unique datasets and integrated insights has never been stronger, including those involving our powerful TWN income, income and employment data. Our ID and fraud prevention solutions and those include news acquired from Kount target ecommerce and retail space, our trust enhancing, thereby improving the overall digital experience for consumers. I'll now hand it over to John to provide our 2021 guidance, and I'll come back to wrap up. John Gamble : Thanks Mark. Now let's turn to slide 14 and our economic and market assumptions for 2021. In December, we provided you with a framework for revenue and adjusted EPS for 2021, as well as the basic assumptions underlying that framework. Our current view of 2021 and the 2021 guidance we're providing are consistent with that view, as are the basic economic and market assumptions underlying them. However the progress with COVID-19 vaccines and expected substantial additional economic stimulus are promising to the 2021 economic recovery. There remain significant uncertainties regarding the timing and pace of economic recovery in the US, as well as internationally. Consistent with our discussion in December, our 2021 guidance assumes US mortgage market are proxy for which is US mortgage credit inquiries will remain strong in the first half of 2021, but declined in the second half. We assumed 2021 credit inquiries overall to be down about 5% versus 2020. The first half credit inquiries up almost 15% and second half inquiries down over 23%. For perspective, US credit inquiries in first half 2021 are assumed to grow about 6% from the strong level we saw in the second half of 2020. January was strong and confirms this trend. Equifax US b2b mortgage revenue, EWS and USIS will continue to significantly outpace the overall mortgage market growth of over 10%. US economic recovery will start early in the second quarter of 2021 with over 3.5% GDP growth for the full year. We expect USIS and Workforce Solutions, non mortgage businesses to outperform their underlying markets. EWS' talent solutions and government businesses should also significantly outperform. Workforce Solutions Unemployment Claims business should be down over 35% versus 2020. As unemployment declines with the recovering economy, and we expect the international economies will also recover in 2021 beginning in the second quarter; we expect full year GDP growth of about 2.5% in Australia over 5% in the UK and over 5% in Canada. Our international business is also expected to outperform its underlying markets. US mortgage market has continued to be very strong, driven by both record refinancings and home purchases, as shown on the left side of slide 15, as of December Black Knight, estimates that about 16.5 million US mortgages could still benefit from the refinancing based on the current record low interest rate environment. While down from September's record levels, there remain significant runway in the refi market as refinance candidates continue to be markedly higher than the previous speaking refinance activity in 2016 in the global recession of 2008, given the current pace of mortgage refinancing that almost 1 million per month based on data through August, we expect elevated levels of refinancing should continue well into 2021. As shown on the right side of slide 15, the pace of existing home purchases further strengthened in 4Q reaching 6.8 million on an annualized basis as of December, up from 6.5 million in September. The trend of families seeking more spaces work from home persistence continuing further supported by the continuation of record low mortgage rates. Slide 16 provides the specifics of our 2021 guidance, including the bridge between the midpoint of our 2021 revenue and addressed EPS guidance and our 2020 results. 2021 revenue of between $4.35 billion and $4.45 billion reflects revenue growth of about 5.4% to 7.8% versus 2020 with FX positively impacting revenue by about 1.5%. USIS revenue is expected to be at mid-single digits in 2020, which includes the benefit of Kount acquisition. EWS will continue to deliver double digit revenue growth with continued strong growth and verification services. International revenue is expected to deliver constant currency growth in upper single digits, strong strengthening beginning in the second quarter, reflecting the assumed economic recoveries I discussed earlier. And GCS revenue will be down mid-single digits in 2021. Revenue declined to 15% plus in 1Q 2021 reflects the weakness in US lead gen partner revenue that Mark discussed earlier. We expect to see improved performance as we move through 2021 driven principally by continued growth and our Consumer Direct business. As a reminder, in 2021 Equifax will include all cloud technology transformation costs, and adjusted operating income, EBITDA and EPS, is one time costs have been excluded from our adjusted operating income EBITDA and EPS in 2017 through 2020. In 2021, Equifax will incur one time cloud technology transformation costs of approximately $145 million, a reduction of about 60%, and the $358 million incurred in 2020. The inclusion in 2021 of this about $145 million in one time costs with reduced adjusted EPS by about $0.90 per share. 2021 adjusted EPS are $6.20 to $6.50 per share, which includes these tech transformation cost is down approximately 7% to 11% from 2020. Excluding these tech transformation costs of $0.90 per share, adjusted EPS in 2021 would show growth of about 2% to 6% versus 2020. 2021 is also negatively impacted by redundant system costs of almost $60 million relative to 2020. These redundant system costs negatively impact adjusted EPS by approximately $0.37 per share, and negatively impact adjusted EPS growth by about five percentage points in 2021. Additional assumptions including the 2021 guidance are capital spending in 2020 is expected to be about $400 million. Depreciation and amortization, excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets is expected to be almost $310 million. This includes about $10 million of D&A from the acquisitions completed so far in 2021. Interest and other income net are expected to be slightly negative in 2021 versus 2020. Our 2021 tax rate is expected to be up from 2020 and slightly above 24%. 2021 Combined corporate and corporate technology costs are expected to be approximately $485 million. About three quarters of the increase from 2020 is driven by the inclusion of technology transformation costs, and adjusted operating income EBITDA and EPS in 2021. These tech transformation costs are principally across the programs. Remainder of the increases principally in security and corporate technology. Slide 17 provides our guidance for 1Q 2021. We expect revenue in the range of $1.105 billion to $1.125 billion, reflecting revenue growth of about 15% to 17%, including a 1.9% benefit from foreign exchange. We are expecting adjusted EPS in 1Q 2021 to be $1.45 to $1.55 per share, compared to 1Q 2020 adjusted EPS of $1.43 per share. In 1Q 2021, technology transformation costs are expected to be just over $45 million or $0.28 per share. Excluding these costs that were excluded from 1Q 2020 adjusted EPS, 1Q 2021 adjusted EPS would be $1.73 to $1.83 per share up 21% to 28% from 1Q 2021. Slide 18 provides a view of Equifax total and core revenue growth from 2019 to 2021. The data provided for 1Q 2021 and full year 2021 reflects the midpoint of the guidance ranges we have provided. In 2021, we expect core revenue growth of over 10% and turning the strong levels delivered in 4Q 2020 and building momentum for 2022. Slide 18 also provides revenue growth from acquisitions for 4Q 2020, calendar year 2020, and expected levels for 1Q 2021 and calendar 2021. For your reference in the appendix of this presentation, we've included slides that provide more detail on 2020 performance and 2021 guidance. They include 2020 revenue trend details for 2Q 2020 through 4Q 2020. Details on the pension accounting change we completed in 4Q 2020. More detail on our 2021 guidance, including both our expectation for US mortgage market credit inquiries in 1Q 2021, Q2 2021 and second half 2021, and an update to the 2020 through 2022 Cloud transformation cost benefits framework we shared with you in December. And with that, I'll turn it back to Mark. Mark Begor : Thanks, John. Turning to slide 19; we made significant progress on our cloud data technology transformation in the second half of last year. Progressing through the data product and customer migration stages of our North American technology transformation. The pace of product and customer migrations continues to accelerate and as of year end 2020, USIS completed over 12,000 customer migrations onto cloud based services including our Intertech Ignite and API capabilities. And Workforce Solutions also completed over 26,000 customer migrations and verification services onto its cloud based portals in online fulfillment platforms. This represents over 95% of the workforce solution verification services customer base. As we discussed earlier, global consumer will complete migration of all Consumer Direct customers onto its transform Renaissance platform over the next several months. Across North America, we need to remain on track to have our US customer migrations completed principally during 2021. Our North American exchange migrations also continue to progress well toward our 2021 goals, including our major North American exchanges of the US and Canadian consumer risk, the work number and NCTUE exchanges. In 2021, we're accelerating strange migration to the data pack, Europe, LATAM and Asia Pacific. Europe and Latin America I've already made substantial progress in deploying interconnect, ignite in our API frameworks in the cloud. And as of 2020, as of the end of the year, international had migrated over 9,000 customers onto cloud based services. In 2021, our focus is on product and customer migration to accelerate the decommissioning of legacy systems and data centers to deliver the customer benefits in Equifax cost savings. We will continue to ramp our focus on delivering new products, and NPI revenue by leveraging our new cloud native data and technology infrastructure. 2021 is a critical year as we drive toward completion of our North American transformation. We remain committed to achieving the substantial top and bottom line benefits from the cloud we discussed with you previously. The Equifax cloud native data Intech infrastructures providing meaningful benefits in the marketplace today, and that will even further differentiate Equifax as we complete the transformation. Turning out a slide 20; this highlights our continued focus on new product innovation, which is a key component of the next chapter of growth at Equifax as we leverage the Equifax cloud for innovation and new products. We continue to focus on transforming our company into a product led organization and powered by the best-in-class cloud native data technology to fuel our top line growth. In 2020, we further invested in NPI resources while leveraging our new Equifax cloud capabilities to deliver 134 new products above the 120 we discussed in December in our historical 70 to 90 NPIs annually. Importantly, in 2020, over 50% of the new products were delivered leveraging our cloud native data and technology.  In our December investor update, we shared with you several products introduced in 2020 that will have the opportunity to drive significant revenue in 2021 and beyond. Response Confidence, watched by USIS, offers tools that empower our customers to enable consumers to share alternative data that's currently available in credit reports. USIS also launched OneView, a configurable consumer report that will allow consumer credit data to be combined with any other Equifax consumer data asset, to create an easily consumable and configurable multi data asset report. In the first quarter, OneVew will incorporate TWN income employment data along with consumer credit and our other differentiated Equifax data assets. Workforce Solutions continues to expand its suite of new products focused on the hiring process. Our new Talent Select suite of VOE solutions products provide easy access to all or a subset of workforce solution data on a candidate across varying price points with fulfillment based pricing. In mortgage Workforce Solutions has launched new products that support lenders need to combine the TWN employment and income data to tax return data. The new product simplifies lenders processes by providing individual or multiple borrower information per loan via a single transaction from Equifax. In Employer Services our I-9 Anywhere product creates a more efficient and low touch onboarding experience. The product allows a new hire to initiate their application from any device such as a phone, tablet or computer via our I-9 app the new hire then schedules the completion of their application from a nationwide network of over 1,300 locations at a convenient time and location of their choice. The I-9 Anywhere products improves accessibility for employees and off site locations, streamlines paperwork and improves and speeds up the onboarding experience for the employee, hiring managers and human resource professionals. With our strong new product launches in 2020, we expect to accelerate our NPI revenue growth in 2021. As many of our NPI revenue is defined as the revenue delivered by new products launched over the prior three years. And our vitality index is defined as the percentage of current year revenue from new products. In 2021, we expect NPI revenue to increase by over 75% with our vitality index, exceeding 7%, which is up substantially for the past three years. Continued expansions of innovation products leveraging the Equifax cloud are central to our strategy and future growth priorities. Wrapping up in slide 21, Equifax finished a challenging 2020 COVID environment with record revenue and earnings and strong momentum as we enter 2021. Our 11% core growth in the fourth quarter reflects the strength of our business model. Our estimated 6.6% growth in 2021 at the midpoint of our range, while still in the midst of the COVID recession reflects the resiliency, strength and momentum of the Equifax business model. We are delivering this growth in the context of our expectations that we see economic recovery in the second quarter, and that US mortgage market activity declined 5% in the second half. Core revenue growth of over 10% in 2021 reflects the strength of our business model as new products and expansion of our data assets allow us to outperform in a still uncertain, global environment. Workforce Solutions will continue to power Equifax as operating performance in 2021. Work numbers is our most differentiated data asset and Workforce Solutions is our most valuable business. And likely we will see that Workforce Solutions become our largest business in the very near future. Rudy and his team are driving outsized growth by focusing on their key levers, new records, new products, penetration and expansion into new verticals. We also expect our USIS mortgage business to continue to outgrow the underlying mortgage market. And we are energized by the outlook for USIS' non mortgage performance and momentum from the fourth quarter from both organic growth and new products and the growth we expect from Kount. USIS is competitive and winning in the marketplace and will deliver in 2021. Internationals return to growth in the fourth quarter is a little positive and we expect that to continue in 2021 as their underlying markets recover. We were encouraged by improving conditions across our international portfolio and we expect the international to outperform these underlying markets. We're also turning the corner; we're turning the corner from building our cloud capabilities to leveraging our new Equifax cloud data and technology to drive innovation, new products and growth. We remain confident in the significant top line cost and cash benefits from our new cloud capabilities. These financial benefits start to ramp in 2021 and are enabled by our always on stability, speed to market and the ability to rapidly build and move products around the globe. Our strong operating performance, strong balance sheet and Equifax cloud data and technology platforms position us to enhance our capability via M&A. We are building our acquisition pipeline as we pursue accretive bolt-on transactions that will strengthen the core of Equifax and meet our stringent mutual criteria. And given our very strong financial performance, our strong cash generation in 2020 and our strong balance sheet and our confidence in the future of Equifax, we are restarting our share repurchase program at an expected level of over $100 million in 2021 to offset dilution from employee benefit plans. We view this as a positive step forward in returning cash to shareholders. While the COVID recession and recovery is still uncertain, we have a lot of confidence in our business model and our ability to perform. We have strong momentum on all fronts as we move into 2021. Equifax is outperforming in the challenging COVID recessionary environment. We are on often in position to leverage the Equifax cloud for innovation of new products to drive future growth, margins and cash generation as a market leading data analytics internet technology company. With hat operator, let me open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our questions from David Togut with Evercore ISI. DavidTogut: Thank you. Good morning and appreciate the detailed business and guidance update. Could you maybe dig into the outlook for EWS a bit more? You called out double digit revenue growth expected? Can you be a little bit more precise there is that approximately 10% or something potentially much higher? And then if you could drill down a little bit into growth expectations for employers services and verification, and maybe just close on your expectations for record growth in 2021 MarkBegor : Yes, we believe in we talked about it that the workforce is clearly our most differentiated business. And when we talked about the strong performance in 2020 that follows from performance in 2017-2018 and 2019. So they've got a long history of growth and have a lot of levers for growth. I don't think we want to get into specific guidance around workforces revenue growth, except that we expect it to outgrow their underlying markets again in 2021. And as we said, we expect that to be in double digit. And we also said it will be for sure the highest growing business inside of Equifax. The levers that workforce has in front of it. And at the top of the list is their ability to add records. That's a very powerful lever and as you know we added records throughout 2020. Those are monetized right out of the chute as soon as we add them to our database. And of course, year-over-year basis those record additions drive revenue growth in 2021. And I think we also stated that we expect to grow records quite confidently in 2021. We added the large agreement we signed just last week with a large payroll processor for an exclusive agreement to contribute their records to Equifax. So that's going to help drive our record growth going forward. On the verifications, clearly they aren't the strongest and largest part of Equifax and the highest margin part. But as you point out talent solutions, it's something we're also excited about, we expect to see some recovery and elements of that business as the market improves, and the economy improves kind of post vaccine. Now we're targeting that kind of second quarter and going into third and fourth. But underlying there, we've got some really impressive growth from our I-9 solution. And we talked about the quality I-9 Anywhere that is really got a lot of traction, because of the uniqueness of the solution. And of course it drives a much higher revenue solution for Equifax. Anything else you'd add John? JohnGamble: I mean government, we expect government to continue to grow very, very nicely, right, we have obviously have a substantial new contract in the government segment and also we continue to build out our suite of solutions that service not only federal but also state and local governments in their benefit system. So we feel very good really across the board in EWS and talent solutions is obviously I-9 Anywhere, but also substantial new products across the talent solutions marketplace in general. MarkBegor: And as a reminder, we've talked many times during 2020 on our calls with you about the new solution, that workforce is rolling out with the Social Security Administration, and they're talking about that being at run rate of $40 million or $50 million a year contract, and that's going to ramp during our 2021, then becomes a full vendor in 2022. That's a very attractive addition to the business and just reflects, again, the uniqueness of the scale of the data set, and the uniqueness of the data itself. DavidTogut: Appreciate that, just as a quick follow up, if you see a ceiling on either down margin expansion for EWS, can this business get above 60%? Or are you going to just reinvest at a high rate, to keep margins approximately in the mid-50s? MarkBegor: Yes, I don't think we need to invest just to keep margins at a certain level, we invest where we see accretive returns for our shareholders, when it comes to internal investments, and we've been doing that quite substantially, I think, over the last three years, and even in 2020, we reinvested that quite substantially in the workforce in the USIS whether it was obviously in the cloud transformation investments, but then new products and new D&A assets, investing in new record additions, so we'll continue to invest. With regards to is there a ceiling on there? I think that's a tough question to answer, it's one that we see a long one way of growth potential for Workforce Solutions. I think I talked about what our expectation workforce will becomes, sometime in the near future, our largest business unit, which is, we think, quite attractive for Equifax, and for our shareholders, because of its highly accretive nature of its revenue growth, as well higher accretive nature of its margins. JohnGamble: Only thing I'd add, obviously, is in terms of acquisitions as well, workforce an area where we're focused, as well as obviously other parts of the business but it continues to be a focus area. Operator : I'll take our next question from Andrew Steinerman with J.P. Morgan. AndrewSteinerman: Hi, there. For the sake of clarity, could you just state what the organic revenue growth is assumed for the 2021 guidance at the midpoint and has this estimate of revenue growth for 2021 change since December call, particularly just asking about the Kount revenues, I assumed Kount revenues weren't in the December call and are in it today? MarkBegor: Yes, so slide 18, we indicate that included in the 2021 guidance, there's about 1.2 points from acquisitions. Right, so if you think about Kount, Kount revenue, we don't have Kount revenue for the entire year, it just closed. And because of that, it's about 1.2 points. So the inorganic revenue is 1.2%, is that covered? AndrewSteinerman: And has your view of organic revenue growth for 2021 change between the December call and today? MarkBegor: It hasn't, Andrew, December call is only a few weeks ago, I think, we still think that's the right guidance for where Equifax is going to perform to 10.5% in organic growth from the business, there's still, as you know, a lot of uncertainties in the COVID recovery, we're betting on it starting in the second quarter, we've already seen some of it in December, January. So I think that's positive towards that assumption that we have and of course, our assumption is that the mortgage market, while still very strong would decline in the second half of 2021. So I think we've got the right guidance. And I think the momentum we have in the fourth quarter; we can support that 10.5%. JohnGamble: And just if you're asking specifically about the numbers between the frameworks we provided in December, and today, they are up about $75 million right on the top and the bottom end. A chunk of average Kount which we just talked about right continues and then also there were some FX benefit. And it also reflects the fact that we think there's obviously risk and timing of recovery of the US economy and other economies. So that $75 million improvement from both the top and bottom reflects those three factors, and obviously we performed a lot better in 2020. And we have talked about in December. So the actual calculated growth rates look different, obviously, are somewhat lower, but the absolute delivery of revenue in 2021 we think is about $75 million higher reflecting the factors that I just referenced. Operator : We will take our next question from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. KevinMcVeigh: Great. Thanks. Any sense of how shift to the cloud is impacting both the pace and cost of new product innovation to dosing end of year to 134. So from the beginning of the year, how should we think about that pace in 2021? And then is there any way to reconcile as to what it can lead to organic growth? Does that have the potential to accelerate the core organic growth as you saw this new product innovation to transact infrastructure higher level and [Indiscernible], what is that? MarkBegor: Yes, it's a great question. And we talked about that, we really believe fundamental to our strategy is to really leverage our cloud investments, which we think are incredibly powerful, both on the technology and data side for innovation and new products. And we talked throughout 2020, we invested more in product resources to really start driving that leverage of the cloud investments, as we focus, when completing the cloud transformation, but more importantly, leveraging it. And as you point out, 134, is a really big increase from our historical product rollouts. And, of course, those rollouts are in the marketplace now, meaning that our commercial teams are starting to take those to market. So that's embedded in our core growth assumption for 2021, which is up substantially from where it was for growth in 2018, and 2019. And actually, up from our historical, kind of pretty, cyber growth rates and NPIs are clearly going to be a big factor in that. In my comment, I mentioned that, I think it was 50% of our NPI during 2020, we're really leveraging the cloud as we move into 2021, that'll be substantially all of our new products, which will speed up our delivery of new products, speed up the time of getting them into the marketplace, and then also drive the number of products that we want to bring to the market. And we have been given assumption or a target for the number of new products for 2021. I think we were clear about our vitality index, which really drives the organic growth among products have been quite substantial 7% in 2021. So that's a clear lever for growth for us. And we think this is, as we get out in 2021, 2022, 2023, this is really central to where we're taking the company is really leveraging the cloud transformation to drive revenue growth, and that's going to happen through innovation and new products. JohnGamble: Kevin, as you know, right, new products tend to deliver the most revenue for us, kind of in year two or three of their life cycle. So we're very excited about the fact that we have very strong obviously new product introductions in 2020, which benefit as Mark referenced 2021 vitality index and revenue contribution, which should also be tremendously beneficial if we looked at 2022. KevinMcVeigh: That makes sense. And then just real quick S&P back in the market with restarted buyback. MarkBegor: I think your question was about the buyback. But I didn't hear the rest of it. What was your question? KevinMcVeigh: Sorry about that. How quickly can you be back in the market? MarkBegor: We tend to start the buyback quite quickly. And we'll lever load that through the year. We think that's a positive step forward and reflects our confidence in the future of Equifax. And we think it's a positive step forward to start with a buyback, that will offset dilution to our employee plans, and again, it reflects our confidence in the future of Equifax and is the first step forward in returning cash to shareholders. Operator : We'll take our next question from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. ToniKaplan: Thank you. Assuming, once you get to the second half, assuming your mortgage market outlook is correct. And that the market slows. I know you're confident in your ability to outperform the market. But how do you think about the delta between your mortgage performance and the market? When the market is slower? Does that delta change because of the lower activity? Or does it stay similar just because of your capabilities? MarkBegor: I think it's a great question, Tony, I think you have to really separate USIS and EWS. Workforce Solutions for both businesses are taking advantage of new products in the mortgage space and rolling out new products in an up market is positive and rolling up new products in a down market is positive. So I think that's one, they both have the ability to grow share, meaning, grow new customers and, Workforce Solutions has more capability there just because the Workforce Solutions data is less used, using mortgage as example than the credit filer, and then workforce has just more leverage than USIS has and its ability to grow in all markets and you've seen that, not only in 2020 you've seen it in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018. And you've also seen it accelerate, they're not, if their core growth, if you will, over the last year and that's driven by a more rapid increase in records, we think it's driven by the scale of the database, when you have hit rates that are north of 50% on the TWN data that becomes increasingly valuable to customers. So that's driving usage of the data, the value of predictability of income and employment data, there's just a lot more levers there. So we've got a lot of confidence in both businesses ability to outgrow the market that's underlying what Equifax does. But I think it's safe to say workforce just has a lot more leverage, and you add records on top of, as you know, adding records in an upper down market is what we do, and we added 10 million records last year, or did you know we had some records leave the database as employment was reduced by some of our contributors, so that was offset from that. And in a improving economic environment, we would expect to see hiring improved, with lots of our contributors, which is also going to drive records, along with actions like the announcement that we shared this morning that we signed another big payroll processor to an exclusive agreement, so new products are going to help both businesses, and we've got a lot of confidence in our ability going forward, to outgrow underlying markets because of the uniqueness of our data on new products and penetration, new usage, and of course, workforce with records. JohnGamble: And, Tony, you're certainly right, right, that lower market activity does affect growth rates and everything. But again, as Mark said, our performances has been so strong relative to the market overall, we feel very good about what that should work handy for the second half. ToniKaplan: That's great. And then I think getting a lot of questions, I think, given the administration's recent appointments on regulators and so could you just talk about your view on what may be changed from a regulatory perspective this year? Would you expect any meaningful changes to be implemented quickly? And are there any areas in particular that you'd expect to see greater focus from regulators? Thank you. MarkBegor: Yes, we would argue that regulators have been quite strong for a long time including during the Trump administration, Equifax, of course, and our competitors operated through the Obama administration, when there was a level of very strong regulation, going into Biden administration, we don't expect meaningful changes, whatever they got we'll respond to them, we play an important role in the marketplace. We've been highly regulated for a long time, and we know what it takes to operate in a regulated environment. I think that's an important characteristic that we have to respond to. And we believe we'll be able to respond to the interest that the regulators have. There's another question on the legislative side is there going to be any changes legislatively around credit bureaus? And so we don't think that we provide a valuable service. And we're focused on ensuring access to credit through alternative data, which is a big priority of the current administration, and we think we have a strong response to that. Operator : We'll take our next question from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. HamzahMazari: Good morning. Thank you. My question is around the fraud business. Could you maybe just talk about what's differentiated in your offering? And specifically as it relates to Kount patent portfolio, which is pretty strong, could you maybe talk about the opportunity to repurpose some of those standards across your current portfolio? MarkBegor: Yes. Of course Equifax has a sizable identity fraud business. We talked a bunch about the market macro, which we think is very attractive, as digitization increases identity and authentication, really is a critically important thing that was happening pre COVID, it was accelerated during COVID, we think it's only going to continue to grow. So we like the macro space, which is why we've been in it for quite some time. And the idea of adding Kount has been on our radar for quite some time. But we know we knew Kount for four or five years. We've watched them and had the opportunity to acquire them and close the deal yesterday. And what Kount brings is that you're really combining with our differentiated data assets and identity and fraud, really just a massive increase in data capabilities signals. The 32 billion interactions they have per year are just massive and the number of addresses, IP addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses. just enhances the capabilities to provide higher predictability. And so the combination of Kount data with Equifax data is going to enhance Kount in the retail and ecommerce space and also enhance Equifax in our traditional spaces. And we'll this week; we're already off to the races of bringing Kount solutions to our banking and lending customers, for example. The other thing attracted to us with Kount is it moves Equifax into a new industry vertical, we were never in the retail and ecommerce space and Kount lives there quite strongly. And then as you pointed out, they have some really attractive technology beyond their data. If you combine a lot of their patent and technology capabilities, along with Equifax is including our patented AI technology NDT, we think that's another powerful combination. So we're very energized about the acquisition; excited to have it closed yesterday. And now we're off to the races, as of yesterday afternoon of integrating and really moving to the market and driving the synergies that were part of our acquisition model, as we get the business up and rolling as an Equifax company. HamzahMazari: Great and very helpful. Just my follow up question and I turn it over is just when you look at your core growth, pre breach, I guess it was 8% then 2%, 3% for 2018 and 2019. And then we sort of jumped to 11%. And then you're guiding for 5%. What's the normalized level of core growth? You think you can do consistently for post tech transformation? Is it sort of an 8% number? Or is it sort of 6%? Any thoughts? I know 2020 was a different year with sort of the Workforce Solutions business. MarkBegor: Yes, we're not ready to put our long-term framework back in place, but I can tell you we're getting to that stage, I would expect it will be something we certainly want to do in 2021. We'd like to see a little more, a few more months under our belt of this COVID recovery to make sure we see that. But I hope you get a sense that our confidence in the Equifax model is quite high. When we look at a core growth in 2020 and the core growth expectation we have for 2021 that's a very meaningful number for us. It's one that we have a lot of confidence in, and we will be ready to share our long-term framework sometime in 2021. But I hope you get a sense that the power of Workforce Solutions, obviously, it needs to be a larger part of Equifax is a positive for our core growth. The new product focus that we have, we've been very consistent with you over the past couple of years is that it's our expectation that the cloud investments that we've made will not only drive our margins and cash, but will also drive our top line is we're able to deliver new solutions we couldn't do before and really drive our new products. So those are all positives from our perspective, and how we think of the long term, growth rate of the company, and we'll be ready to share that with you in the coming future. Operator : We will take our next question from Kyle Peterson with Needham. KylePeterson: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. So just start off on the EWS segment, you guys have really strong year there. Have you guys noticed in one of your big competitors come out with an offering a few months back and had a partnership with a pretty big payroll provider as well. Have you guys notice any change in either the competitive environment, or new business wins or any momentum in the last few months in that segment? MarkBegor: We've not. We haven't seen any kind of commercial traction on that yet. We expect there will be but at the same time, we've got a lot of confidence in the scale of a Workforce Solutions business model, the 20,000 verification customer network that we have, it's taken a decade to build, our database is multiples of what we believe our competitors will ever be able to access given the scale of our additions. And as a reminder, of the 114 million actives we have 60% of those we've done with individual companies over a decade, it takes a long time to build that database. We also had a database that has 350 million total records including inactive and a third, close to a third of our revenue comes from inactive records, which is another characteristic is very unique to workforce solutions. So we've got a high confidence in our business model. And as we shared on this call, we signed an exclusive arrangement with another large payroll processor just last week, that's going to be coming between and they came to TWN, because of the scale of our capabilities, and what we can deliver for them, and what they can deliver to their customers. And then, of course, the revenue share opportunity, it's a very meaningful with Equifax. And it's more challenged when you're in a start up mode. KylePeterson: Got it. That's something very helpful color. And then just a follow up on the GCS business. I know the partner revenue is kind of in a tough spot. Just what would it take for I think some of your partners to start pumping their marketing and helping that trend kind of improve? Is it the better trends in like cars and auto markets? Or just like how should we kind of think about that business as the economy hopefully bounces back here in 2021? MarkBegor: You nailed it, it's really the economic recovery, it's their customer, who are primarily card issuers, P loan originators, having more confidence in building their originations, what we believe many big card companies are doing is, using their own modeling to generate new customers now, and I would characterize more cautiously and we're seeing that in our revenue directly with card companies, while it's improving, they're so cautious in this uncertain economic environment. And when you're cautious, I ran a credit card business for 10 years, you're going to be careful about, who you use for lead gen, lead gen generally focus on your own versus buying leads from someone else. So it's our expectation that as the economy improves, and as we move past the COVID pandemic to whatever the new normal is, our view is that we're starting to see that in the latter part of 2020, for sure in our non mortgage businesses and continuing in January, but that'll also show up, for our lead generation customers, and their revenue will grow. JohnGamble: And GCS and global work, we are excited about our Consumer Direct business, right, that continues to grow. And we've seen the first growth out of it in quite a while in the third and fourth quarter. So we think that's a very positive outcome. Operator : We will take our next question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays Capital. ManavPatnaik: Thank you. Good morning. I just had a few there. So firstly just on the organic growth, I just wanted to confirm right, so in December, the implied organic growth is close to 6%. Now it's 2.5% to 5%. And I guess what you're saying is basically the toughest comp that was created in 4Q is a reason why you just haven't updated and given the uncertainties, is that correct? MarkBegor: So I'm going to make sure I understand the query, I think you're asking about the difference between the framework we provided in December, and the guidance we just provided, is that correct? You're just coming through that. I apologize. ManavPatnaik: That's all right. Just on the core organic growth, right? Because Today's guidance implies 2.5% to 5% organic, which is more than what it was in December? MarkBegor: So we performed much better in December than we expected, right. So our revenue came in very strong. So I understand that you're talking about a growth rate off of our much stronger 2020 performance. But our view of 2021 right is actually slightly better than it was when we talked to you in December. And we took -- we increased the bottom and top end of our range by $75 million. And that reflects Kount. It reflects some FX benefits. But it also reflects the fact that we continue to believe there's substantial risk in the timing of the recovery. So that's really what it is. So yes, we have a stronger December than we expected. So 2020 was very, very good. But our view of 2021 is actually slightly better than it was when we talked to you in December. ManavPatnaik: Okay, fine. And then in terms of the exclusive partnerships we have with the payroll provider, I understand why the large provider would want to come to Equifax but I'm just curious, why did they sign exclusive? I was hoping for some color there because why not sign up with others as well and monetize their data multiple times. MarkBegor: Yes, Manav, as you probably know from prior discussions, the bulk of our relationships are exclusive. And we think that's the right arrangement between us and our partners. The partners really think having one relationship is the way to operate. And they believe that brings more value to their customer base Remember, if you're -- easy example of a payroll processor, this is not a core activity for you. But by providing the income and employment verification services to their customers, they're providing a new value added service, from a company like Equifax, they deliver that service to their customers, which are primarily their processing payroll for free, so becomes more valuable, and in our case, we just have more scale for their employees, meaning, we can access 20,000 different mortgage originators, auto originator, car originators, meaning, we can deliver more value to them than a startup could, which is why their desire around exclusive is more important. I think the scale of Equifax and Workforce Solutions also plays into it, the history we have over a decade of providing income and employment verification, the security in debt controls we have around privacy, around how the data is used is also a big part of the discussion for our partners, because they want to make sure they protect their customers data, always play into why the bulk of our relationships are exclusive and why this one is too. ManavPatnaik: Okay, and if I could just squeeze in one quick one. You talked about a lot of things; I just want to get an update on how you see your partnership with Syco fitting into the scheme of things and how that's going. Thanks. MarkBegor: Yes, so it's gone well, we launched a couple years ago, we've got a couple of products in the marketplace. We're still building out some of the technology but Will and I have a monthly call with the team to talk about progress. And we still believe that that's going to be positive for Equifax and for Syco. So we're very committed to it. And we're continuing to look for more solutions that we might do together that would leverage both Equifax and Syco. Operator : We will take our next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. ShlomoRosenbaum: Hi, good morning. Thank you for squeezing me in here. Hey, just a few little ones to finish off. John, just as you compare like the framework to the 2021 guidance. People focus a lot on kind of the revenue growth rate change, which you stated has to do more with the outperformance in 2020 than it has to do with expectations for 2021. Redundant system processes that have gone up over 45 million to almost 60 million. I was wondering if you can tell us what's going on over there a little bit. JohnGamble: So was the question, what was -- can you say the end, I think that you were a little garbled. I didn't hear exactly what the end question was. ShlomoRosenbaum: Sure. Redundant system cost seems to have gone up from $48 million -- $45 million to $58 million. I'm just wondering, what's going on over there? JohnGamble: Sure. So just as we continue to move through time, right, we get more clarity on the pace at which we're able to bring new systems to the cloud, which that drives the incremental costs that we're incurring. And that continues to progress really well. So as we continue to move forward, we're able to better view how those costs are going to be incurred. And then that gives us a view as to when decommissioning will occur. And just as you look to within 2020, we have a very nice pace of new systems moving into the cloud, which will -- which should drive the very good 2022 performance that we talked about, and we talked about during the framework. So we're just refining the model and continuing to work forward, slightly higher depreciation I think we talked to you about before, and slightly higher cloud costs, in the context of our total cost base, not really a very big number. ShlomoRosenbaum: Okay, thank you and then just increase the share repurchase program, it doesn't seem like it's that aggressive, given the company's kind of return to growth. Is there potential to kind of upside down more during the year? And also what about the dividend? There hasn't been a change in the dividend in the years, as well? JohnGamble: Yes, I think I hope you caught the characterization that we had. This is a positive step forward. But I would also say that the last step for Equifax, but we thought it was timely to at least start to return cash to shareholders and offset employee plan dilution as we talked earlier in this call, and we've talked for quite some time. It's our expectation that we'll be rolling out our long term financial framework but will also include our capital allocation plan later in 2021. We want to see a few more months of the COVID recovery before we put that in place, but our confidence was quite strong and where we believe the company's going which is why we opted to announce this first step in our buyback and as you know like our dividend growth was not part of our long term framework prior to the cyber event and stock buyback was also and we've been quite consistent, but it's our expectation that both of those will be a part of our long-term framework and capital allocation in the future. ShlomoRosenbaum: Okay, if you don't mind me, I might just squeeze one more, social security contract is that same one half. Does that slip at all? I kind of -- was under the impression that was going to be starting in the first quarter of this year. JohnGamble: Questions on the timing of this social security contract? That is starting on the technical work in the first quarter and revenue will star, as we get into second. It'll continue to ramp through the year. And I think we talked about the run rate when fully deployed, which will be in 2022 full run rate is $40 million to $50 million a year of revenue. Operator : We'll take our next question from Brett Huff with Stephens Incorporated. BrettHuff: Good morning. Thanks for all the details guys. I'll just -- just one question. So the bigger picture one, as you guys think about the analytics market versus the unique data market, you're playing in both. And can you talk about how you're thinking you attack that market? Is it more do we lead with the data and back into the analytics of the cross sell? Or do we lead with the analytics products and then use the data as a cross sell? Or am I thinking about that paradigm, kind of incorrectly? Thank you. MarkBegor: No. I think you are thinking about it the right way. And it really depends on the customer. If you think about the larger, more sophisticated customers, they have very sophisticated, typically analytics teams. We still help them with analytic solutions, whether it's scores or models for them, but they do a lot of that themselves, so that they would be more of a data consumer, but with a supplement of advanced analytics from Equifax, and as you go down, in the scale of customers, you quickly get into customers that are really looking for more turnkey solutions from us, meaning a full product, and that would be new products and the scores, new solutions, they really they can plug in as opposed to try to create themselves. And that's why the capabilities we have, first and foremost, continuing to expand our differentiated data assets is clearly at the heart of what we want to do. And now that we have that data in the cloud, and a single data fabric, it allows us and our customers to more easily access that data, in our case, to deliver analytic solutions that are just much more sophisticated and have multi data elements to it, that we think will be quite powerful like going forward. And you're starting to see that, ramp and NPIs last year, the 134, we delivered is really a good example of our focus on bringing those solutions to market. BrettHuff: Just a quick follow up from a buying behavior point of view, are we getting more kind of office of the enterprise data? Is there a data and analytics czar at? I don't know medium, large enterprises? And are they doing buying there? Or are we still selling into individual business units, and maybe the left hand and the right hand don't know that they're both buying from you guys or another analytics company? MarkBegor: It's again depends on the size of the company. There's a lot of companies leverage their sourcing relationships to try to package everything they do, which from our case, we view is advantageous in most cases, because of the particularly the strength of TWN. If you're bringing in that in the commercial relationship, it's just a very valuable data asset. There are still a lot of customers that buy by product line, that's who we interact with. And that's who we're working and bringing solutions to. We're bringing different solutions to the mortgage business unit inside of a financial institution than we are to the auto or card or P loan. So it does vary on what we're bringing from analytics as well as product capability. So it is varied by customer. Operator : We will take our next question from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. AndrewNicholas: Hi, good morning. You spent $32 million on organizational right sizing in the quarter sounds like it was necessary to enable some of that deceleration and tech transformation spend you expected this year. I'm just wondering if there are additional costs of this type of this nature you'd expect to incur in 2021. And if so, are those included in the $145 million of one time transformation expense you've outlined for the year? MarkBegor: So I think when we talk in December right, we indicated that we would expect to see some decline in tech transformation expense by quarter as we go through the year. And you can see that because the $45 million in the first quarter is obviously more than 25% of the total that we gave. So we will -- you'll see a decline in our tech transformation expense as we go through the year. And I think if we get into talking to more fully about 2022, we can talk about whether there could be additional right sizing costs that could come. But there would be nothing included in our guidance. AndrewNicholas: Got it. And then switching gears a little bit, I was hoping you could refresh us on the open banking opportunity abroad; maybe provide a bit more color on how AccountScore addresses this opportunity, specifically? And then lastly, is it your expectation that your AccountScore acquisition could benefit other capabilities or provide other capabilities that you can pull over to other regions? Or is that primarily a European business? Thank you. MarkBegor: Yes, great question. Open banking is as you know is really getting some traction in many markets, like the UK and Australia. And in all of our markets, we have partnerships like in the United States, we have a partnership like with Yodlee, around consented data, and we've got a partnership in Canada, we got another one in Australia and our partner in the UK with AccountScore, and there was an opportunity to acquire them, which we thought was very strategic, and very strategic for our UK business. And we also believe, as you point out that there's going to be some capabilities around categorization, assets that they have and capability and some of their technology that we may be able to use in other markets on a global basis. Operator : We'll take our next question from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities. AndrewJeffrey: Hey, guys, lots to digest here. Appreciate the insights. I have a question Mark, just specifically on EWS unemployment, I realized it's a relatively small business in the grand scheme of things, but the guidance is here, can you unpack that a little bit in terms of whether that's purely returned to something like full employment in the US, or if there was any transitory benefit from pandemic in terms of employers that might have come to you for assistance in automation that they perhaps no longer need as the economy recovers just a little more color, that would be helpful. MarkBegor: So we as you might imagine, we're adding customers during 2020, as we normally do, in Workforce Solutions, and Employer Services, and we provide, we have a lot of value added services that are beneficial in some regards to macro, when a company is struggling, they look for ways to improve their efficiencies, and by outsourcing to Equifax, some of those activities to workforce solutions, there's a positive there for them. So that was clearly part of our focus in 2020 it will continue in 2021. And then, of course, the big macro is less employees or reducing employees, generally is lower activity for our broader services business. And as we seen some pickup, we expect that to continue in 2021, as the COVID recovery unfolds, that'll be a positive for that business. And then on top of that, we talked about some of the products stuff that we're doing like the I-9 Anywhere is really a very, very strong growth just because the uniqueness of the solution, allowing a prospective employee to complete that process remotely, was a positive during COVID. But it's also positive, longer term, it just is faster, they don't have to come to the HR office, and we can do that so many different locations, that really drives speed and a lot of employers want to get employees on the floor or into the warehouse quickly. And this capability really helps drive that speed element. JohnGamble: And just specific to 2021 guidance, the decline in the unemployment insurance claims revenue that we gave was specifically just related to an assumed economic recovery and substantial reduction in unemployment claims. So there's no -- there's nothing behind it. AndrewJeffrey: Okay, that's helpful, John. And then just as a quick follow up, can you just speak to at a high level, how much if any of the tech report platforming savings you anticipate next year are likely to be reinvested in the business? MarkBegor: I think we gave some decent framework in 2022; you've seen and what we expect the savings to be, we haven't -- we're not ready to give 2022 guidance. I think we were clear in December. We have been all year that we expect the tax savings to enhance our margin but we also expect to continue to invest in Equifax going forward, whether it's a new products or other priorities. And when we're -- when we share our long-term growth framework, we'll get a real framework on that, on the long-term basis, and will certainly walk you from 2021 to 2022 to long-term growth framework that we will be putting back in place. Operator : Our next question comes from George Mihalos with Cowen. GeorgeMihalos: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to ask at a high level Mark, as you see some of this newest sort of payment products buy now pay later and the like, can you talk a little bit about the conversations that you're having with your Fi issuer customers? How are they thinking about that from a competitive standpoint? Is that something you think can have an impact on your business, either negative in terms of lower card growth or positive in terms of meeting more of your services for them to compete? MarkBegor: Yes, it's a latter, we're talking to all of them and providing dating services to them, they still have to do a level of underwriting is anyone who would if you're going to extend credit. And for us, we view it as a positive, macro meaning that there's more lending in essence this is a buy now pay later is a lending. Now that's positive for Equifax because we can help them it's authentication as a part of that you have to verify to the individuals who they say they are, and there's an element of underwriting that takes place. And then there's another piece around that data. And we're working with that ecosystem to collect that data, so we can add it to our existing data in order to help them in their processes. GeorgeMihalos: Okay, that's helpful. And just a quick follow up on the buyback, we should be thinking that this is designed to offset dilution not to actually reduce share count, is that the right way to be thinking about it from a modeling standpoint? MarkBegor: Correct. That's our intention with this first step in our buyback program was to offset share dilution from employee plans, and we think it's a show of confidence hopefully you do it that way by Equifax, as a step forward in our confidence in the future. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jeffrey Meuler with Baird. JeffreyMeuler: Thank you. Good morning, Mark, you gave some good commentary on EWS record count contributor relationships and incentives. I want to try to simplify it. But obviously, there's a risk that I'm going to miss something important in that but so would love any correction if I am wrong. So the exclusivity ask is from Equifax, with common contractual relationship with a partner channel is revenue share. It's a dual sided network, and you have the biggest network of verifiers. So there's a better revenue opportunity for your partners by partnering with Equifax. Is that the primary motivation of the two sides? Or are there some other benefits to contributors to sign exclusivity with Equifax? MarkBegor: I think I shared that with earlier question, I don't know if you caught that. So you hit obviously very important points for the partnership. But it's also really important Jeff to understand that this is a very important relationship because it's a relationship between the partner called payroll processor and their customer meaning accompany the HR manager, and there's a lot of trust around that. So there's also an element of who you're going to partner with, and what's their history of being in the space, the fact that we have a million companies contributing to us, and they're just 60% of the data assets that we have, we've gone to company by company to collect that history plays in that conversation, very, very strongly meaning that we've done it, we do it well, we protect the privacy. And then there's also the scale to the employee. Remember, this is a real benefit for a company's employees to help them with their financial lives, how they access credit. And if you look at the alternative that payroll processors companies today, their customers, they're doing that verification individually by the HR manager, there's a lack of privacy. There's a lot of work involved. How do you know if a mortgage company calling that HR manager at that small company to verify the income and employment of one of their employees? We do that a lot for them, so it's a very important relationship. So the value added service and the idea of having two companies do it versus one our conversation with our partners is there's not a lot of interest in that, for the economic reasons you raise, but I would argue more importantly, because of the scale of Equifax, the scale of Workforce Solutions, the scale of our privacy and data capabilities, our business model and how we operate, that is as important or more important than the revenue share, which of course, we believe it's very hard to compete with Equifax from a revenue share standpoint. JeffreyMeuler: Got it. But I asked for couple additional color for me. And then just a definitional question is core growth, organic constant currency or this core growth includes the impacts of acquisitions and FX. MarkBegor: It includes the impact of acquisitions and FX. Although on that slide, we did give you what those impacts are. Right, yes. We always break them down every quarter. Operator : We will take our next question from Simon Clinch with Atlantic Equities. SimonClinch: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I know we're coming quite long into this call. I was wondering if we could just go back to USIS margins in the quarter. John, I believe you talked about mix issues or the mix impact on margins there. And I was wondering if you could help us think about how to think about the incremental margins, excluding the tech transition costs, as we go forward through 2021. And specifically, if we're modeling mortgage revenue declines or headwinds in the second half, does that mean you should expect higher incremental margins and vice versa? JohnGamble: Yes, so you're specifically referencing USIS, yes, and as we've talked about in the past, so the margins on mortgage specifically because of mortgage solutions are lower, right, so the two factors are obviously in mortgage solutions we buy and resell the trended file from our competitors. And then also, the score cost some mortgage are just higher than they are in any other vertical. So those two factors negatively impact our gross margin on mortgage. So yes, as mortgage grows substantially, it's a negative to the margin percentage is obviously very profitable, right. But negative to margin percentage for USIS and as mortgage declines, it's somewhat of positive. Obviously, that isn't the only factor that moves that affects margin. So I can't tell you that that's the only thing that will move them around. But as you're thinking about it, yes, that's correct SimonClinch :  Okay, all right. Thanks. And just follow up. Maybe we could jump back to the EWS and the payroll processor agreement you have in placed. In terms of the -- well, I guess, I'm taking a step back and think bigger picture here. Is there any reason to think that say in 10 years time this market would become -- would have removed from these sort of exclusive relationships to maybe dual sourcing in any way, as it has done in other parts of the credit market for example? And if not, why wouldn't that be the case? MarkBegor: Yes, we don't think so. Given the scale of our capability, remember, it's quite important that only 40% of our data records and of course it is 40%, come through this partnership model. 60% are individual companies that we've added over a decade. And that takes a lot of effort to add those going into a company, convincing them you have the capabilities. And of course, we do it every day; we're adding companies every week, individually, at the same time, as we're working on these larger partnerships with payroll processors. So that scale really gives we believe Equifax a real advantage in what we delivered to our customers, and then also how a contributor meaning whether it's a company or a partnership, like payroll processor thinks about working with someone like Equifax, just because of the scale of our capabilities. And we're showing pretty clearly that we're expanding that scale, 10 million record additions last year, the conversation we had earlier about a very large, they will processor moving forward with us on an exclusive basis later this year. There's a real momentum there for the business going forward. And then the other element that I think as you know is that we're going beyond that W2, we want to expand to 1099 and self employed and gig employees. So there's a lot of work on that by Equifax there that it's just another vertical data records for us, that we think is quite attractive. And we talked also about even moving beyond our attention to move beyond income employment and look for other data records that are a part of that hiring process. As whether it's licensure or other data records. SimonClinch: I understand, yes. So to just follow up quickly there, in terms of the companies that provide the data, is that invariably a highly labor intensive collection or arrangement there, I'm just wondering if there's some way in future data becomes more automated and easier to collect, and so easier for new entrants to start chipping away at those individual relationships. MarkBegor: No, these are companies that are highly automated. We talked in a couple of questions on this call about the sensitivity they have, they're in the business of processing payroll and other services for the HR manager, that's their core business, and they want to make sure that if we're going to partner with someone on income and employment verification, that they're doing it with someone who's going to deliver real value to their customers, that's going to be done securely with real privacy. In course, we've been in this business for a decade. And then also the idea of a revenue share because of our scale, we can monetize those records, quite broadly across, the 20,000 verification customers we have that becomes an advantage in a relationship. Operator : Our next question from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. GeorgeTong: Hi, thanks, good morning. Do you expect core revenue growth to be 10.5% in 2021? Can you discuss how much of 10.5% you expect from outperformance to the mortgage market? And then break out where you expect the remaining growth to come from in detail if you have it? MarkBegor: Yes, so I don't think we're going to get a lot more detailed in the 10.5% that we provided but what could happen as we move through the year right, as we've talked about the fact that we expect underlying economies to improve. So we expect our non mortgage revenue growth to improve meaningfully as we go through 2021. So you'll see non mortgage be a substantially larger contributor to core revenue growth as you move through the year. So that is we do expect that to occur, and we think that's one of the contributors to the fact that we'll be able to deliver very nice core revenue growth, even in a declining mortgage market. GeorgeTong: And just to follow up on that first question, before on the business update call, you did say that you expected outperformance to the non mortgage market to be less than half of the core growth this upcoming year? Is that still the case here? MarkBegor: So you're talking about comment on the December 7 call? GeorgeTong: Yes. MarkBegor: So I think what we expect is what I just said, right, is we're expecting to see very nice improvement in our non mortgage revenue, not just in the US, not just EWS and USIS but also internationally. And I think that will provide substantially more contribution to core revenue growth in 2021. GeorgeTong: Got it, that's helpful. And then Mark, do you expect the US mortgage market to increase 15% in the first half of 2021 and decline 23% in the second half of the year? How would you handicap the upside downside potential to your forecasts based on the refinancing opportunity out there? And also home purchase terms? MarkBegor: That's a tough one, we're not economists obviously. And we're certainly not build to forecast that we tried to be really transparent with you and our investors in all throughout 2020, in the December call just went through and, tried to take all the forecasts that are out there from NBA and Black Knight and others and, bring it together in something that felt reasonable. We still think that feels reasonable that there will be a decline, certainly at some point. you could spend a long time on this call talking about the positives and negatives that might drive that obviously, low interest rates are positive. I think the Fed's position is positive. Where the COVID recovery is going, it feels a little more uncertain which is obviously a part of our forecast for guidance for 2021? And we still feel good about that framework, which is why we shared it in December and we haven't really changed it as we sit here now in February, and we still think it's the right way to start the year is we think about guidance for Equifax. Operator : Our next question from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America. GaryBisbee: Hi, good morning. Mark I just wanted to clarify something from your prepared remarks. I believe I heard you say USIS non mortgage revenue was flattish in Q4, which is improvement obviously from the prior quarter but then up five in December and up to six in January, was that right or was the up five and six something else? And if so, what's driven that sequential improvement in trend in recent months? Thank you. MarkBegor: So just to be clear, I think the commentary was specific around online. Okay, not around total. And if all I was trying to indicate is that basically the trend was improving through the fourth quarter, and we saw a nice performance in December and effectively, it's continuing in January, that's all. GaryBisbee: And what are the key underlying drivers of that? Is it more of that sort of consumer credit activity? Or is it new products or other things that you're going to deliver that? Thank you. MarkBegor: There's no question that there's an element of economic improvement or consumer activity by our customers. There's no question there and we talked about that in third quarter result kind of steps forward in the fourth quarter, and that's really continuing. And then on top of that we're in the marketplace, whether we're trying to gain share or roll out new products, that's a positive element on that also, but certainly underlying that is economic activity. GaryBisbee: Right. And then just a quick follow up to just a level set for us. Can you tell us what percent of 2020 revenue and both uses and Workforce is mortgage related? MarkBegor: So we will post shortly in five minutes updated views of revenue by vertical for every business, you get an echo back, so if it's okay, if I could ask you to wait five minutes, you'll see it post on the website. Operator : And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the profits back to Mr. Hare for any additional and closing remarks. Dorian Hare : Thanks everybody for joining today's conference call. We look forward to engaging with you again in April when we release our first quarter of 2021 results. In the interim, myself, Mark, as well as John looking forward to engaging with you in different forum throughout the quarter. This does conclude our conference call. Thank you. Operator : That concludes today's presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dorian Hare, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Dorian Hare : Thanks and good morning. Welcome to today\u2019s conference call. I\u2019m Dorian Hare. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com. During the call today, we will be making reference to certain materials that can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website under Events and Presentations. These materials are labeled Q1 2021 Earnings Release Presentation. During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including second quarter and full year 2021 guidance to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors that may impact our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, under our 2020 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. Also, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our website. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark. Mark Begor : Thanks, Dorian. Before I address Equifax's very strong first quarter results, I want to again thank our 11,000 employees and families that supported them for the tremendous dedication they continue to show under the challenging COVID environment over the past year. We continue to make the health and safety of our employees a top priority and I hope that you and those close to you remain safe. Turning to Slide 4, and as I will cover in a moment, Equifax delivered an outstanding first quarter with record revenue and strong sequential growth versus fourth quarter. The tremendous progress we have made executing against our strategic priorities and building out our Equifax cloud capabilities is allowing us to outperform our underlying markets and deliver outstanding revenue growth and margin expansion. In the U.S. where the economy is still recovering from the COVID pandemic more rapidly than we anticipated, we continue to outperform the overall mortgage market, which remains strong in the first quarter. We're also seeing a real recovery and strong growth across our core banking, auto, insurance, government, and talent business segments. We delivered growth again in the first quarter internationally with continued challenging COVID restrictions in place in most of our global markets and we expect to see acceleration in this growth as economies recover outside the U.S. First quarter was a great start to 2021. We are energized by our strong momentum and pivoting to our next chapter of growth with the launch of EFX2023, our new strategic growth framework that will serve as our company-wide compass over the next three years. With our new Equifax Cloud foundation increasingly in place, we're focused on leveraging our new Equifax Cloud data and technology infrastructure to accelerate innovation, new products, and growth. Innovation and new products will fuel our growth in 2021 and beyond as we leverage our new EFX Cloud capabilities to bring new products and solutions and multi-data insights to customers faster, more securely, and more reliably. As you know, we ramped our investments in product and innovation resources over the past 12 months to accelerate our new product rollouts leveraging the new Equifax Cloud. Our highly unique and diverse data assets are at the heart of what creates Equifax\u2019s differentiation in the marketplace. We have data assets at scale that our competitors do not have, including TWN, NCTUE, DataX, IXI and more and we are committed to expanding and deepening these differentiated data assets through organic actions, partnerships and M&A. We're also relentlessly focused on a customer-first mentality, which moves us closer to our customers with a focus on delivering solutions to help solve their problems and drive their growth. Another critical level of our strategy is to reinvest our accelerating free cash flow in smart, strategic and accretive bolt-on acquisitions that both expand and strengthen our capabilities with a goal of increasing our revenue growth by 1% to 2% annually for M&A and data security is deeply embedded in our culture, we have clearly established Equifax as an industry leader in data security. Working together as one aligned global Equifax team, where we leverage our commercial strengths, our new products and our capabilities across our EFX Cloud global platform, will allow us to deliver solutions that only Equifax can bring to the marketplace. We're energized around our new EFX2023 strategic priorities that will serve as our guidepost over the next three years and support our new long-term growth framework that we plan to put in place later this year. Turning now to Slide 5, Equifax performance in the first quarter was very strong. Revenue at $1.2 billion was the strongest quarterly revenue in our history. In first quarter, constant currency revenue growth was a very strong 25% with our growing organic growth at 23%, which was also an Equifax record. As a reminder, we're coming off a solid 13% growth in first quarter last year. All business units performed -- outperformed our expectations and we are seeing positive signs of a COVID recovery beginning to accelerate, particularly in the U.S. Our growth was again powered by our two U.S. B2B Businesses, Workforce Solutions and USIS, with combined revenue up a very strong 38%. Mortgage-related revenue remained robust, and importantly, our non-mortgage-related verticals grew organically by a very strong 16%. The adjusted EBITDA margins of our U.S. B2B businesses were 52%, up 400 basis points, with EWS delivering close to 60% margins. As a reminder, Workforce Solutions and USIS are over 70% of Equifax revenue and 80% of Equifax business unit EBITDA. First quarter Equifax adjusted EBITDA totaled $431 million, up 36% with over 250 basis points of expansion in our margins to 35.6%. This margin expansion was delivered while including all cloud technology transformation costs and our adjusted results, which negatively impacted first quarter adjusted EBITDA margins by over 300 basis points. Excluding Kount cloud transformation costs, our margins would have been up over 500 basis points. We are clearly getting strong leverage out of our revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA -- adjusted EPS at $1.97 per share, was up a very strong 37% from last year, which was also impacted by the inclusion of cloud transformation costs. Adjusted EPS would have been $2.20 and up 54% excluding these costs. We continue to accelerate our EFX cloud data and technology transformation in the quarter, including migrating an additional 2,000 customers to the cloud in the U.S. and approximately 1,000 customers internationally. Leveraging our new EFX cloud infrastructure, we also continue to accelerate new product innovation. In the first quarter, we released 39 new products, which is up from 35 launched a year ago in the first quarter, continuing the momentum from 2020 where we launched a record 134 new products. And we're seeing increased revenue generation from these new products leveraging our new EFX cloud. For 2021, we expect our vitality index defined as revenue from new products introduced in the last three years to exceed 8%. This is 100 basis point improvement from the 7% guidance we provided in our vitality index back in February. And in the first quarter, we completed five strategic bolt-on acquisitions, with a focus on identity and fraud capability through our acquisition of Talent and accelerating growth in Workforce Solutions with the acquisitions of HIREtech and i2Verify. Acquisitions that will broaden and strengthen Equifax are a strong lever for continuing to accelerate our growth and a big focus. We were energized by our fast start to 2021 and are clearly seeing the momentum of our only Equifax model, leveraging our new EFX Cloud capabilities. Our first quarter results were substantially stronger than the guidance we provided in February with over 90% of the revenue outperformance delivered in our two U.S. B2B businesses, Workforce Solutions and USIS. Importantly, as we'll discuss in more detail shortly, over 60% of this outperformance in the U.S. B2B revenue was in our non-mortgage segments in both USIS and Workforce Solutions. Non-mortgage revenue strengthened consistently during the first quarter with March revenue up significantly versus February in both USIS and EWS. This broad-based strength was above our expectations and gives us confidence about further strengthening in the second quarter and second half as the COVID recovery unfolds. Mortgage revenue was also stronger than we expected, despite the growth in U.S. mortgage market at 21% being slightly below our expectations from a slowing -- from slowing mortgage inquiries in late March, which have continued into April. Our continued strong mortgage results and outperformance was driven by Workforce Solutions, with stronger market penetration, record growth, and positive impact from new products. USIS mortgage revenue also exceeded expectations slightly. The stronger revenue delivered strong operating leverage with substantial improvement in our EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS. The strength of our first quarter results in Workforce Solutions and in U.S. non-mortgage revenue across USIS and Workforce Solutions more broadly, gave us the confidence to substantially raise our 2021 guidance for both revenue and adjusted EPS. We're increasing our revenue guidance by $225 million to a midpoint of $4.65 billion and increasing our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.55 a share to a midpoint of $6.90 per share. This includes our expectation that the U.S. mortgage market for 2021, as measured by credit inquiries, will decline more in our February guidance of down 5% to a decline of approximately 8%. Our framework assumes that the mortgage market slows primarily in the third and fourth quarter, which is consistent with our prior guidance. John will discuss our mortgage assumptions in more detail in a few minutes. Turning to Slide 6, our outstanding first quarter results were broad-based and reflect better-than-expected performance for all - from all four business units. Workforce Solutions had another exceptional quarter, delivering 59% revenue growth and almost 60% adjusted EBITDA margins. Workforce Solutions is now our largest business, representing almost 40% of total Equifax revenue in the fourth quarter and is clearly powering our results. Verification Services revenue of $385 million was up a strong 75%. Verification Service mortgage revenue again more than doubled for the fourth consecutive quarter growing almost 100 percentage points faster than the 21% underlying growth we saw in the mortgage market credit inquiries in the first quarter. Importantly, verification services non-mortgage revenue was up over 25% in the quarter. This segment of verification services continues to expand its market coverage and benefit from NPIs new records, new use cases and as a long-term growth lever for Workforce Solutions. Talent Solutions, which represents over 30% of verifier non-mortgage revenue almost doubled, driven by both new products and recovery in U.S. hiring. Government Solutions, which represents almost 40% of verifier non-mortgage revenue also returned to growth driven by greater usage in multiple states of our differentiated data. As a reminder, we continue to work closely with the Social Security Administration on our new contract that we expect to go live in the second half and ramp to $40 million to $50 million of incremental revenue at run rate in 2022. Our non-mortgage consumer business, principally in banking and auto, also showed strong growth in the quarter as well, both from deepening penetration with new lenders and from some recovery in those markets that I'll cover more fully in the discussion of USIS. Debt management, which now represents under 10% of verifier non-mortgage revenue was, as we expected, down versus last year, but is stabilized and we expect to see growth in that vertical as we move through 2021. Employer Services revenue of $96 million increased 17% in the quarter, driven again by our unemployment claims business which had revenue of $47 million, up around 47% compared to last year. In the first quarter, Workforce Solutions processed about 2.8 million UC claims, which is up from 2.6 million in the fourth quarter. EWS processed roughly one-in-three U.S. initial unemployment claims in the quarter, which was up from one in five that they had been processing in recent periods, reflecting the growth in Workforce Solutions UC market position. As a reminder, we continue to expect UC claims revenue to decline sequentially in the second quarter and throughout the balance of 2021 as the U.S. economy recovers and job losses dissipate. We currently expect to decline in the second quarter UC revenue of about 45% versus last year and a full year 2021 decline in UC claims revenue of just under 30%. Employer Services non-UC businesses had revenue down slightly in the quarter. Our I-9 business driven by our new I-9 Anywhere Solution continued to show very strong growth with revenue up 15%. Our I-9 business is expected to continue to grow substantially to become our largest Employer Services business in 2021 and represent about 40% of non-UC revenue. Reflecting the growth in I-9 and the return to growth of workforce analytics, we expect Employer Services non-UC businesses to deliver organic growth of over 20% in 2021. The HIREtech and i2Verify acquisitions that we closed in March had a de minimis impact on revenue in the quarter, but will add \u2013 will further add to Workforce Solutions growth during the rest of 2021. I'll discuss both HIREtech and i2Verify a little bit later. Reflecting the power and uniqueness of TWN data, strong verifier revenue growth and operating leverage resulted in adjusted EBITDA margins of 59.3% and almost 800 basis point expansion from last year in Workforce Solutions. Rudy Ploder and the Workforce Solutions' team delivered another outstanding quarter and are positioned to deliver a strong 2021. Workforce Solutions is clearly Equifax's largest and fastest-growing business. USIS revenue was up a very strong 19% in the quarter with organic growth also a strong 17%. Total USIS mortgage revenue growth of $177 million was up 25% in the quarter, while mortgage credit inquiry growth up 21% was slightly below the 24% expectation we shared in February. As I mentioned John will cover our updated view of the mortgage market for 2021 in a few minutes. USIS mortgage revenue outgrew the market by 500 basis points in the quarter, driven by growth in marketing and debt -- new debt monitoring products. Non-mortgage revenue performance was very strong, with growth of 15% and organic growth of 11%, which is a record for USIS and of a fairly strong first quarter last year. We view this outperformance by US as meaningful and a reflection of the competitiveness and commercial focus of the USIS team. Importantly, non-mortgage online revenue grew a very strong 16% in the quarter with organic growth of almost 11%. We saw non-mortgage revenue growth accelerate in February and March as vaccine rollouts increased and financial institutions gained confidence in the consumer and the economy. Banking, auto, ID and fraud, insurance, and the direct-to-consumer all showed growth in the quarter, which is encouraging as we move into second quarter and the rest of 2021. Commercial was about flat, while only Telco was down in the quarter as we expected. Financial Marketing Services revenue, which is broadly speaking our offline or batch business, was $53 million in the quarter, up almost 12%, which is also very positive. The performance was driven by marketing-related revenue, which was up over 20% and ID and fraud revenue growth of just under 10% as consumer marketing and originations ramped up. In 2021, marketing-related revenue is expected to represent about 45% of FMS revenue with identity and fraud about 25% and risk decisioning about 30%. This strong growth across our non-mortgage businesses, including strong growth in marketing specific offline revenue, is very encouraging for both the recovery of our underlying markets and our non-mortgage performance as we move into second quarter and the rest of 2021. The USIS team continues to drive growth in their new deal pipeline with first quarter pipeline up 30% over last year, driven by growth in both the volume and the size of new opportunities and NPI roll outs. First quarter win rates were also higher than levels seen in 2020. Sid Singh and his USIS team continue to be on offense and are competitive in winning in their marketplace. In addition to driving core business growth in the first quarter, USIS also achieved an important strategic milestone in closing the acquisition of Kount, an industry leader in providing AI-driven fraud prevention and digital identity solutions. Integration efforts are now underway with a key focus on technology and product, leveraging the joint Equifax and Kount data and capabilities. Kount's technology platform will migrate to the Equifax Cloud in the next 12 to 18 months, which will allow for the full integration of Kount and Equifax capabilities for new solutions, new products and market expansion in the fast-growing identity and fraud marketplace. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins of 42.9% in the first quarter were down about 180 basis points from last year. About two-thirds of the decline was due to the inclusion of tech transformation costs in our adjusted EBITDA in 2021. The remainder of the decline was principally driven by the higher mix of mortgage products and redundant system costs from our cloud transformation. Moving now to international, their revenue was up 3% on a constant currency basis in the quarter, which is the second consecutive quarter of growth in our global markets that are still very challenged by COVID lockdowns and slow vaccine rollouts. Revenue growth improved significantly in Canada, Asia Pacific, which is our Australian business and Latin America. This was partially offset by revenue declines in the UK, principally due to continued UK lockdowns in response to the COVID pandemic. Asia-Pacific, which is principally Australia business, had a very good performance in the first quarter with revenue of $87 million, up 7% in local currency. Australia consumer revenue continues to improve relative to prior quarters and was down only about 2% versus last year compared to down 5% in the fourth quarter. Our commercial business combined online and offline revenue was up a strong 9% in the quarter, a solid improvement from fourth quarter. And fraud and identity was up 15% in the quarter following strong performance in the fourth quarter. European revenues of $69 million were down 5% in local currency in the first quarter. Our European credit business was down about 5% in local currency. Spain revenue was down about 1%, while the UK was down about 6% in local currency similar to the fourth quarter from continued challenging COVID environments. Our European debt management business revenue declined by about 4% in local currency in the quarter. Both the CRA and debt management businesses were impacted in the quarter by actions taken by the UK government to curtail debt placements in response to the pandemic resurgence in the United Kingdom. As the lockdown and other actions lift in April and May, we anticipate improvements in UK CRA revenue in the second quarter and improvements in debt management revenue in the second half of 2021 as collection activity restarts in the latter part of the second quarter. Latin American revenues of $42 million grew about 1% in the quarter in local currency, which was an improvement from the down 1% we saw in the fourth quarter. These markets also continue to be heavily impacted negatively by continued COVID lockdowns and slow vaccine roll-ups. We continue to see the benefit in LatAm of strong new product introductions over the past three years, which is benefiting their top line. Canada delivered record revenue of $44 million in the quarter, up about 13% in local currency. Consumer online was up about 3% in the quarter, an improvement from the fourth quarter. Improving growth in commercial, analytical and decision solutions and ID and fraud also drove growth in Canadian revenue in the first quarter. International adjusted EBITDA margins at 28.2% were down 30 basis points from last year, excluding the impact of the tech transformation costs that we've included in adjusted EBITDA, margins were up about 200 basis points. This improvement was principally due to revenue growth and operating leverage, partially offset by system -- redundant system costs from our cloud transformation. Global Consumer Solutions revenue was down 16% on a reported basis and 17% on a local currency basis in the quarter and slightly better than our expectations. We saw better-than-expected performance in our global consumer direct business, which sells directly to consumers through Equifax.com and myEquifax and which represents about half of total GCS revenue.  Direct-to-consumer revenue was up a strong 11% in the quarter, their third consecutive quarter of growth. Decline in overall GCrevenue in the quarter was again driven by our U.S. lead generation partner business, which has been significantly impacted from COVID beginning in mid-2020. As we discussed, we expect a decline in total GCS revenue from our partner vertical to moderate substantially as we move into the second quarter and return to growth in the fourth quarter of 2021. GCS adjusted EBITDA margins of 24.6% were up about 150 basis points. We expect margins to be pressured to around 20% in the second quarter, reflecting planned costs to complete the migration of our consumer direct business, cloud transformations in the US, UK, and Canada, to our new Equifax Cloud platform. Moving to Slide 7, this chart provides an updated view of Equifax's core revenue growth. As a reminder, core revenue growth is defined as Equifax revenue growth, excluding: number one, the extraordinary revenue growth in our UC claims business in 2020 and 2021; and number two, the impact on revenue from U.S. mortgage market activity as measured by changes in total U.S. mortgage market credit inquiries. Core revenue growth is our attempt to provide a more normalized view of Equifax revenue growth, excluding these unusual UC and U.S. mortgage market factors. In the first quarter, Equifax core revenue growth, the green section of the bars on Slide 7, was up a very strong 20%, reflecting the broad-based growth across Equifax. And this is up significantly from the 11% core revenue growth we delivered in the fourth quarter and well above our historic core growth rates. Workforce Solutions and USIS have continued to strongly outperform the mortgage market. The 16% organic growth in U.S. B2B non-mortgage revenue also drove our core revenue growth. Importantly, our core revenue growth has accelerated over the past five quarters from 5% in first quarter 2020 to 11% in the fourth quarter of last year and to 20% this quarter, reflecting the strength and resiliency of our broad-based business model, power of Workforce Solutions, the market competitiveness of USIS and benefits from our cloud Equifax -- our cloud, data, and technology investments and our increasing focus on leveraging the cloud for innovation new products. As you know, the strong growth is in the midst of a global market that is still recovering from the COVID pandemic. Turning to Slide 8, Workforce Solutions continues to power Equifax and clearly is our strongest and most valuable and largest business. Workforce Solutions revenue grew a very strong 59% in the first quarter with core revenue growth accelerating to 46%. As a reminder, the 59% growth is off 32% growth in first quarter of 2020. The strong outperformance in sequential improvement reflects the power of the unique TWN database and Workforce Solutions business model. At the end of the first quarter, the TWN database reached 115 million active users and 90 million unique records, an increase of 9% or 10 million active records from a year ago. And as a reminder, over 60% of our records are contributed directly by employers that Workforce Solutions provides Employer Services like UC Claims, W-2 management, I-9, WOTC and other solutions, too, and we've built these relationships over -- with these \u2013 with our customers and contributors over the past decade. The remaining 35% are contributed through partnerships, most of which are exclusive. The major payroll processor agreement that we announced on our February call is still on track to go live later this year, which will add to our TWN database. And we have a dedicated team, as you know, focused on growing our TWN database with an active pipeline of record additions to continue to expand our TWN database. The Workforce Solutions team continues to focus on expanding the number of mortgage companies and financial institutions with which we have real-time system-to-system integrations, which as you know, drives increased usage of our TWN data. The team is also focused on extending our operations into card and auto verticals, as well as across our growing government vertical. And as I mentioned earlier, we continue to work closely with the SSA and expect to go live with our new solution in the second half of this year, which will deliver $40 million to $50 million of incremental revenue and run rate in 2022. The Workforce Solutions new product pipeline is also rapidly expanding, as our teams leverage the power of our new Equifax cloud infrastructure. We are anticipating new products in mortgage, talent solutions, government and I-9 in 2021. New product revenue will increase in 2021 and 2022 as we begin to reap the benefits of our new products introduced to the market during last year and in 2021. Rudy Ploder and the Workforce Solutions team have multiple levers for growth in 2021, 2022 and beyond. Workforce Solutions are the most -- Workforce Solutions is our most valuable business and will continue to power our results in the future. Slide 9 highlights the ongoing exceptional core growth performance in mortgage for our U.S. B2B business -- mortgage businesses, Workforce Solutions and USIS. Workforce and USIS outgrew the underlying U.S. mortgage market again in first quarter with combined core growth of 48%, up from 37% in 2020 and in line with the 49% growth they delivered in the fourth quarter -- 49% core growth. This outperformance was driven strongly by Workforce Solutions with core mortgage growth of 99%. Consistent with past quarters, Workforce Solutions outperformance was driven by new records, increased market penetration, larger fulfillment rates and new products, proof that lenders are increasingly becoming reliant on the unique TWN income and employment data when making credit decisions. USIS delivered 5% core mortgage revenue growth in the quarter, driven primarily by new debt monitoring solutions with further support from marketing. Our ability to substantially outgrow all of our underlying markets is core to our business model and core to our future growth. I'd now like to turn it over to John to discuss current trends in the mortgage market and to walk through our revised second quarter and full year 2021 guidance. John Gamble : Thanks, Mark. As Mark referenced earlier, U.S. mortgage market inquiries remained very strong in 1Q 2021 and up 21%, but that growth was slightly lower than the 24% we had expected when we provided guidance in early February. As shown on the left side of Slide 10, as mortgage rates increased over the past few months and refinancing activity continues, the number of U.S. mortgages that could benefit from a refinancing has declined to about $30 million. Although still very strong by historic standards, this is down from the levels we saw in 4Q 2020 and early 1Q 2021. Based upon our most recent data from 4Q 2020, mortgage refinancings were continuing at about $1 million per month. As shown on the right side of Slide 10, the pace of existing home purchases continues at historically very high levels. This strong purchase market is expected to continue throughout 2021 and into 2022. Based on these trends and specifically, the reduction in the pool of mortgages that would benefit from refinancing, we are reducing our expectation for the mortgage market financing activity in 2021. As shown on Slide 11, we now expect mortgage credit inquiries to be about flat in 2Q 2021 versus 2Q 2020 and to be down about 25% in the second half of 2021 as compared to the second half of 2020. Overall, for 2021, we expect mortgage market credit inquiries to be down approximately 8%. This compares to the down approximately 5% we discussed with you in February. Slide 12 provides our guidance for 2Q 2021. We expect revenue in the range of $1.14 billion to $1.16 billion, reflecting revenue growth of about 16% to 18%, including a 2.1% benefit from FX. Acquisitions are positively impacting revenue by 2%. We are expecting adjusted EPS in 2Q 2021 to be $1.60 to $1.70 per share compared to 2Q 2020 adjusted EPS of $1.63 per share. In 2Q 2021, technology transformation costs are expected to be around $44 million or $0.27 per share. Excluding these costs that were excluded from 2Q 2020 adjusted EPS, 2Q 2021 adjusted EPS would be $1.87 to $1.97 per share, up 15% to 21% from 2Q 2020. This performance is being delivered in the context of the U.S. mortgage market, which is expected to be flat versus 2Q 2020. Slide 13 provides the specifics on our 2021 full year guidance. We are increasing guidance substantially despite the expectation of a weaker U.S. mortgage market. 2021 revenue of between $4.575 billion and $4.675 billion reflects revenue growth of about 11% to 13% versus 2020, including a 1.4% benefit from FX. Acquisitions are positively impacting revenue by 1.7%. EWS is expected to deliver over 20% revenue growth with continued very strong growth in Verification Services. USIS revenue is expected to be up mid to high single digits, driven by growth in non-mortgage. International revenue is expected to deliver constant currency growth in the upper single digits, and GCS revenue is expected to be down mid-single digits in 2021. 2Q 2021 revenue was also expected to be down mid-single digits for DCS. As a reminder, in 2021, Equifax is including all cloud technology transformation costs and adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EPS. These one-time costs were excluded from adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EPS through 2020. In 2021, Equifax expects to incur one-time cloud technology transformation costs of approximately $145 million, a reduction of about 60% from the $358 million incurred in 2020. The inclusion in 2021 of this about $145 million in one-time costs would reduce adjusted EPS by $0.91 per share. This is consistent with our guidance for 2021 that we gave in February. 2021 adjusted EPS of $6.75 to $7.05 per share, which includes these tech transformation costs, is down approximately 3% to up 1% from 2020. Excluding the impact of tech transformation costs of $0.91 per share, adjusted EPS in 2021, which show growth of about 10% to 14% versus 2020. 2021 is also negatively impacted by redundant system costs of over $65 million relative to 2020. These redundant system costs are expected to negatively impact adjusted EPS by approximately $0.40 a share. Additional assumptions included in 2021 guidance are provided -- will be provided in the 1Q 2021 earnings slide deck to be posted later this morning. Slide 14 provides a view of Equifax total and core revenue growth from 2019 through 2021. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of movements in the mortgage market on Equifax revenue, as well as the impact of changes in our UC claims business within our EWS Employer Services business, and also the employee retention credit revenue from our recently acquired HIREtech business. Employee retention credits are specific U.S. government incentives for companies to retain their employees in response to COVID-19 and the associated revenue is not expected to continue into 2022. The data shown for 2Q 2021 and full year 2021 reflects the midpoint of guidance ranges we provided. In 1Q 2021, we delivered very strong core revenue growth of 20% and expect to continue to deliver strong core revenue growth in 2Q 2021 of about 20% and 16% for all of 2021. This very strong performance, we believe, positions us well entering 2022 and beyond. And now I'd like to hand it back over to Mark. Mark Begor : Thanks, John. Turning to Slide 15. This highlights our continued focus on new product innovation, which is a critical component of our next chapter of growth as we leverage the Equifax Cloud for innovation, new products and growth. We continue to focus on transforming Equifax into a product-led organization, leveraging our best-in-class Equifax cloud-native data and technology to fuel top line growth. In the first quarter, we delivered 39 new products, which is up from the 35 we delivered last year. We're encouraged by this continued strong performance, especially following the record 135 new products we delivered last year. We wanted to highlight some of these new products, which we expect to drive revenue in 2021 and beyond. First, Insight Score for credit card launched by USIS provides the credit card industry with a specific credit risk score created using credit and alternative data that predicts the likelihood of a consumer becoming 90 days past due or more within 24 months of origination. USIS also launched a new commercial real estate tenant risk assessment product suite, which provides real-time and unmatched data analytics and risk assessment for tenants, buildings and portfolio strength, delivered through an interactive, ignite marketplace app or as a stand-alone report. And Workforce Solutions continues to expand its suite of products focused on the government vertical. Their government enhanced solutions, Social Services Verification product, gives the ability for the customer to choose the desired period of employment history with options ranging from three months, six months, one year, three years or the full employment history. These products help government agencies quickly and efficiently administer federally \u2013 federal supplement -- supplementary nutrition, child health insurance, Medicaid, Medicare benefits, managed child support and insurance program integrity. In the first quarter, over two-thirds of our new products launched or in development leveraged our new Equifax cloud-based global product platforms. This enables significant synergies and efficiencies in how we build the new products, our speed to bring the products to market and our ability to move the new products easily to our global markets. Our new cloud-based Luminate platform for fraud management is a great example, which is launching in Canada and the U.S. simultaneously and will soon launch in the United Kingdom, Australia, and India. This would have taken much longer and been much more expensive in a legacy environment. We're also rolling out our Equifax Cloud-based Interconnect and Ignite platforms for marketing and risk and decisioning and management products throughout Latin America, Europe, Canada, as well as the United States. As we discussed on our call in February, we're focused on leveraging our new cloud capabilities to increase NPI rollouts and new product revenue growth in 2021 and beyond. As a reminder, our NPI revenue is defined as the revenue delivered by new products launched over the past three years and our vitality index is defined as the percentage of current year revenue delivered by NPI revenue. As I mentioned earlier, we've increased our 2021 vitality index guidance from 7% by 100 basis points to 8%, as you can see from the left side of the slide, is a significant increase from about 500 basis points in 2020. NPIs are a big priority for me and the team as we leverage the Equifax cloud for innovation, new products, and growth. Turning to Slide 16, M&A plays an important role in our growth strategy and will be central to our long-term growth framework. Our team is focused on building an active pipeline of bolt-on targets that will both broaden and strengthen Equifax. Our M&A strategy centers on acquiring accretive and strategic companies to add unique data assets, new capabilities, deliver expansion into identity and fraud, or expand our geographic footprint. In the first quarter, we closed five acquisitions totaling $866 million across strategic focus areas of identity and fraud, Workforce Solutions, open data, and SME. We discussed three of these transactions with you in February, which were the acquisitions of Kount and Kount score, and Credit Works. As I discussed earlier, we're excited about expanding opportunities we see from the combined Kount and Equifax in the fast-growing identity and fraud marketplace. In March, we closed two Workforce Solutions bolt-on transactions, HIREtech and i2Verify, which will further broaden and strengthen our Workforce Solutions business. HIREtech is a Houston-based company that provides employee-related tax credit services as well as verification services. HIREtech also has unique channel relationships to provide these services through payroll providers, consulting firms, and CPA firms. i2Verify is a Newburyport, Massachusetts-based company that provides secure digital verifications of income and employment services. The company has a unique nationwide set of record contributing employers with concentrations in the healthcare and education sectors. i2Verify also brings unique records to the TWN database, all of which are contributed by direct relationships. You should expect Equifax to continue to make acquisitions in these strategic growth areas that offer unique data and analytics to our customers with a goal of increasing our top line by 100 to 200 basis points annually from M&A. Before wrapping up, I want to speak to you about an area of significant focus at Equifax and importance to me personally. Slide 17 provides an overview of Equifax's ESG strategy and how it helps position us for long-term sustainability. I hope you saw and had a chance to read our annual report letter that highlighted our increased focus on ESG. First, Equifax plays an important role in helping consumers live their financial best. A primary example of this is that, our alternative data assets, such as utility and phone payment data, provide lenders with a better picture of the approximately 30 million U.S. individuals that do not have traditional credit files or access to the formal financial system. I've also made advancing inclusion and diversity, a personal priority since I joined Equifax. Believing that diversity of thought leads to better decisions, we've taken clear steps to broaden diversity at Equifax, including the last three Directors added to our Board are diverse, and all seven individuals have been added to my senior leadership team since I joined three years ago, have also been diverse. We're carrying out this focus on inclusion and diversity across Equifax. We're also focused on environment -- on our environmental impact and greenhouse gas footprint. Our cloud transformation will move our existing legacy technology infrastructure to the cloud, which will dramatically reduce our environmental impact as we leverage the efficiencies and carbon-neutral infrastructure at our cloud service providers. Over the course of this year, we -- or over the course of last year, we decommissioned six data centers, over 6,800 legacy data assets and over 1,000 legacy applications. We have a detailed program underway to baseline our energy usage and benefits from our cloud transformation as we work towards a commitment regarding carbon emissions and a net zero footprint. We're also committed to being the industry leaders regarding security. With the leadership of our CSO, Jamil Farshchi, our culture puts security first. All employees are required to take a mandatory security-focused training sessions every year. And all of our 4,000 bonus eligible employees have a security role in their annual MBOs. We believe -- we also believe in sharing our security protocols and strategies with our partners, customers and competitors to collaborate to keep us all safe. In 2020, we hosted our inaugural Customer Security Summit, where we detailed our progress on security transformation and discussed advancements in supply chain security. As threats continue to evolve, we remain highly focused on continuing to advance our security efforts. Wrapping up on Slide 18. Equifax delivered a record-setting first quarter and we have strong momentum as we move into second quarter in 2021. Our 27% overall and 20% core growth in first quarter reflects the strength and resiliency of our business model while still operating in a challenging COVID environment. We've now delivered five consecutive quarters of sequentially improving double-digit growth. We're confident in our outlook for 2021. And as John described, are raising our full year midpoint revenue by 500 basis points to $4.65 billion and our EPS midpoint by 9% to $6.90 a share. Our revised revenue estimate of 12% growth in 2021 at the midpoint of the range, off of a very strong 17% in 2020 reflects the resiliency, strength and momentum of the EFX business model. Our increased 2021 growth framework incorporated our expectation as John discussed that the U.S. mortgage market will decline about 8% in 2021 and while operating in a still recovering COVID economy. Our expectation for core revenue growth of 16% in 2021 reflects how our EFX2023 strategic priorities are delivering. Workforce Solutions had another outstanding quarter of 59% growth and will continue to power Equifax's operating performance throughout 2021 and beyond. The work number is our most differentiated data asset and Workforce Solutions is our most valuable business. Rudy Ploder and his team are driving outsized growth by focusing on their key levers, new records, new products, penetration, and expansion into new verticals with our differentiated TWN database. USIS also delivered an outstanding quarter of 19% growth highlighted by non-mortgage revenue growth of 15% and 11% organic non-mortgage growth. We expect our non-mortgage growth to accelerate as the U.S. economy recovers. The acquisition of Kount is providing new opportunities and products in the rapidly expanding identity and fraud marketplace and USIS continues to outperform the mortgage market from new products, pricing, and increased penetration. USIS is clearly competitive and winning in the marketplace and will continue to deliver in 2021 and beyond. International grew in the first quarter for the second consecutive quarter, overcoming economic headwinds from significant COVID lockdowns and slower vaccine rollouts in our global markets. Our expectations are high for ongoing sequential improvement in international during 2021 and for accelerating growth as their underlying markets recover from the COVID pandemic. We're also making strong progress rolling out our new EFX cloud technology and data infrastructure and remain confident, as John described, in the significant top line, cost, and cash benefits from our new EFX Cloud capabilities. These financial benefits will ramp as we move through 2021 and continue to grow in 2022 and are enabled by our always on stability, speed-to-market and ability to rapidly build and move products around the globe. Our strong performance -- operating performance is allowing us to continue to accelerate investments in new products leveraging our new Equifax Cloud capabilities. And we're off to a strong start in 2021 with 39 NPIs in the first quarter on top of the record 134 we launched in 2020. And our strong outperformance is fueling our cash generation, which is allowing us to reinvest in accretive and strategic bolt-on acquisitions. As discussed earlier, we closed five acquisitions in strategic growth areas in the first quarter and we have an active M&A pipeline. We look for bolt-on acquisitions that will strengthen our technology and data assets and that are financially accretive with a goal of adding 100 to 200 basis points to our top line growth rate in the future. I'm energized about what the future holds for Equifax. We have strong momentum across all of our businesses as we move into second quarter. We're on offense and position to bring new and unique solutions to our customers that only Equifax can deliver, leveraging our new EFX cloud capabilities and our strong results and the increased guidance that we provided reflect that. With that, operator, let me open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] All right. We'll take the first question from David Togut with Evercore ISI. David Togut : Thank you. Good morning. Looking at the over 20% EWS revenue growth guide for this year, can you quantify contributions you expect from new unique record growth, pricing, and new use cases? Mark Begor : Yes, I think the answer is yes. Those are all meaningful levers. I would add the system, system integrations in our mortgage market and other solutions is also a lever for growth. David, I think, as you know, we don't break those out specifically, but it starts with records. We've clearly got a real focus on and some real momentum in adding records to the TWN Database. As you know, we have a dedicated team that that's all they do. And we've got active dialogues going with individual corporations to bring their data to us as we add new services like UC claims and WOTC and all the myriad of services that we provide and also with other payroll processors. And as you know, in February, we announced that our plan -- and we're on track to add one of the major payroll processors records to our database in the second half of 2021, which will add meaningfully. And I think you know, our business model as we grow records, we're able to monetize those really instantly because of the inquiries that we receive just drive our hit rates up. We clearly have the ability to use price, which we talked about. I think you've seen a real increase in the focus on new products at Workforce Solutions, particularly as they're becoming cloud-enabled. It's giving them the opportunity to bring new solutions to the marketplace to really leverage their data sets. And these new solutions are typically at higher price points and delivering more value to our customers. So that's another big lever. We've talked about \u2013 in the second half that, they're continuing to focus on systems and system integrations, and we just find higher usage when customers move from accessing the TWN database through the web to system-to-system integrations, we get really all their volume, which is another big lift. And as I mentioned a couple of times, we're still on track to launch our new agreement with the Social Security Administration. It's a very meaningful contract that will go live in the second half and we expect that to be $40 million to $50 million in run rate. So there's a large amount of levers available for Workforce Solutions. As you point out, it starts with records. And while we've grown records to 90 million uniques in the quarter, as you know, there's 155 million non-farm payroll. So there's a lot of room between 90 million and $155 million as we continue to grow towards having the full data set. And then we talked before that we're also widening dataset beyond W-2 income, including 1099 and other data sources as we look for other ways to include other portions of the U.S. population around are they working and how much do they make. David Togut : Thanks for that. Just as a quick follow-up. You closed 2020 at almost 60% EBITDA margin for EWS. Can you quantify operating leverage in this business for 2021? Mark Begor : Well, it\u2019s - there's a lot of leverage, as you could see in the first quarter results. I think you're talking about Workforce Solutions. We're continuing to invest in the business. There's no question about that. But with the revenue growth that we're getting on both the mortgage and non-mortgage side in Workforce Solutions, there's real operating leverage that we expect to continue through 2021. David Togut : Understood. Thank you. Operator : All right. [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Manav Patnaik : Thank you. Good morning. I was just hoping, Mark, you could talk about the comments you made towards the end of the call around acceleration of the non-mortgage business with this reopening? And perhaps off that $225 million that you raised revenue by, like how much of that was just the strong performance in EWS, you called out versus maybe some incremental M&A and this reopening benefit that you think you'll see? Mark Begor : Yes, we don't have any incremental M&A in that guide. We wouldn't include that acquisitions that we haven't completed yet. I think we talked that we have a pipeline and a goal of increasing acquisitions. Of course, we're off to a very fast start this year on M&A. You know this, Manav, we took down our framework for mortgage inside of that revenue framework that we shared, which is quite significant. We think that we've got mortgage in the right spot now at down 8% versus the down 5% for the year. And as you know, that the way we frame that is most of that happens, really all of it really happens in the second half. And an expectation that there will be a recovery in the economies as vaccine rollouts continue and lockdowns are reduced, there's still some impact, we believe, of the COVID pandemic in the U.S. market. Although, as we pointed out, we saw some real recovery by our customers. And I characterize that as confidence, meaning they're starting originations in the latter part of the first quarter and into April, which we expect that to continue. But you still have -- our international markets are still significantly impacted by the COVID pandemic and we expect that to unfold at some pace during 2021 and that will be a positive as we move forward. Would you add anything, John? John Gamble : No, we've just said in the past, right, that increasingly, as we go through 2021, as the non-mortgage markets recover, increasingly, their contribution to core growth is going up, right? So, we're -- so we expect that to continue as we go through the year. And the outperformance in the first quarter, as we said, more than half of it was driven in our non-mortgage segments, and you're seeing that obviously flow through the rest of this year as well. Mark Begor : And then I would add to it, too, that I hope you caught our comments around, we really feel like the Equifax Cloud is providing benefits. Our NPI focus is providing benefits that will benefit our mortgage business as well as our non-mortgage business. And. of course, the majority of Equifax is non-mortgage, but the initiatives that we launched over the last couple of years, the investments that we've made over the last couple of years, we feel are starting to pay off. When you talk about USIS, we mentioned many times even over the last year, on each of these quarterly calls that we feel a real strength in the marketplace by our USIS team competitively. Commercially, how they're going to market, I think, we've talked about we've rebuilt that team a year ago and there's some room momentum there. And again, the focus on new products, those are driving revenue growth and we guided up 100 basis points in our vitality index. The bulk of that is going to come in our non-mortgage business. Manav Patnaik : Okay, got it. And Mark, I was hoping you could just help us also, just appreciate the different moving pieces in the -- I think you talked about Workforce Solutions growing about 20% this year, but there's obviously a lot of moving pieces between Employer and Verification Services. I was just hoping you could give us some guidance there on how they should end up in the year. Mark Begor : You want to try that one, John? John Gamble : Sure. So -- yes, I think in Mark's script, we tried to walk through what the real big drivers, right? Verifier is continuing to perform extremely well. Obviously, mortgage is a bit of a draw -- a drag. But as you go through the rest of this year, if you think about what we said in February, we'd indicated that for total mortgage for Equifax, that even though the market was down 5%, we expected revenue to grow more than 10%. And even though we now have the market weaker at down 8%, we still expect mortgage revenue to grow more than 10%. But some significant drivers of EWS in 2021 continue to be in the non-mortgage segment. We talked about talent solutions growing very, very fast, almost doubling, I think we said in the first quarter and I-9 also growing very, very fast and a recovery in WFA. So what we think you're going to see is very nice growth across the non-mortgage segments, obviously, excluding UC, where we gave very specific guidance. And then also continued good performance in mortgage despite the fact that the market is slowing, right? We're not going to quantify each of those. But directionally, that's what's going on. Manav Patnaik : All right. Thank you. Operator : All right. The next question is from Kyle Peterson with Needham. Kyle Peterson : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question, guys. I just wanted to touch on EWS, particularly the momentum and increased adoption you guys are seeing in some of the non-mortgage. Could you guys dive a little more into where the strongest areas s that \u2013 is that in other lending products like auto or card or where is some of the strength that you guys are seeing coming from right now? Mark Begor : Yes. Non-mortgage is obviously more than financial services. I'll come back to that, but we've talked a bunch about our government vertical, which is growing quite positively. Our Employer Services is non-mortgage. Our talent solutions business, so we talked about the growth there. And I think specifically, you're talking about non-mortgage verification. So, I'll go back to that versus non-mortgage broadly in workforce because we've got a bunch of levers that are outside of verification that are growing quite positively, again, excluding the negative impact of UC Claims on a year-over-year basis. So in financial services, as you know, mortgage is our largest in verification, for sure and we're getting real leverage and outgrowing the market there. So first, records health everywhere, right? So, in -- whatever the solution is, as we grow our records and, of course, they're up 10% year-over-year and we've got a clear path to increase them in 2021, and that's part of our framework. Those hit rates are good in any vertical you're in, whether it's mortgage or auto or government, et cetera. So records are number one. We\u2019ve had a real focus on new products broadly in Equifax and in Workforce Solutions. And then you talk about some of the verticals, we're seeing increased usage in auto, where -- kind of year ago or two years ago, it was more of a subprime usage along with the credit file. Now we're seeing it more in near prime. So there's just more usage in the auto sector and broader usage at those lower credit scores. So that's helping there. Personal loans has always been a pretty strong space for us in the Fintech market for verification, using it because if you think about a personal loan, it's $10,000, $20,000, $30,000, it's a very large transaction. And verifying how much someone makes and are they employed at the time of the loan is a very important lift in the predictability. And then we've talked really for the last, I think, three or four quarters about the fact that we're seeing a number of card issuers take our data and, of course, a sliver of our data. We don't \u2013 given the depth of data that they would have in a mortgage application and using it in originations, in other applications in the card space. And we've got now, I believe, two of the large card issuers that are using our data ad origination, along with the credit file, which is a big breakthrough. We've been chasing this market for some time. I'm an old card originator. I did that for a decade before Equifax. The predictability of adding is someone working and how much do they make to the credit file enhances every credit decision period. And it was really around getting our database to scale. And we've talked the last couple of quarters that as we've gone over 50% hit rates in the database, as we get to that 90 million uniques versus the $155 million non-farm payroll, it becomes a data set that's more usable because you get more hit rates. So, that's another thing that we -- reason we think we're getting more new uses of it in things like that cards. John Gamble : The only thing I'd add, right, and as Mark said, our two biggest segments in verifier are government and talent solutions, and they're growing very fast. And both of those are highly benefited by the depth of the database by the fact that we have over 450 million total records. Being able to pry history in those market segments is very important. So, we're seeing very strong growth in the two biggest non-mortgage verifier segments of both government and talent solutions. Kyle Peterson : Got it. That's really helpful color. And then I guess just a quick follow-up on the verification side of the business, like increased noise in the last few months with TransUnion and Plaid, both making some splashes in that space. Have you guys noticed any change in competition when you guys go-to-market either with users of the verification services or potential employers, payroll providers, et cetera? Mark Begor : We have not. We actually hear mostly about it from you, meaning the sell-side. And we talked many times that we think we have a strong franchise. The scale of our database is extremely large. I think of the 90 million uniques at 115 million actives, the ability to get those kind of records is quite challenging, we believe, meaning to have a database that's usable. And having a database that has 1 million or 2 million or 3 million or 10 million records, it's just very challenging for -- to take that to market. When we can deliver over 50% hit rates, it just is quite challenging. And I think you know, 60% of our records come from individual companies and we get those records through long-term relationships. We've been doing this for a decade. We have a full suite of services. We provide HR managers that allow us access to those records and we provide that service, the income employment piece of that for free to the company and to their employees, and it's a real benefit to them. So, those kind of services are really required, we think, to have a database of our scale. And as we've talked, the other 35% or so of our database comes from payroll partnerships and the bulk of those are exclusive, meaning we're an exclusive arrangement, they're not going to provide those records to someone else. So, we think that's quite challenging. And you add on top of that, that we've been investing in this business for over a decade. We've put about $2 billion into it, including a couple of acquisitions just in the last 30 days to strengthen Workforce Solutions. In the last two or three years, we probably invested $200 million to $300 million in the technology of the business. This is -- requires a massive investment. And I'm not sure the competitor you reference is thinking about or planning to have the kind of investments that we have. And just to be clear, we intend to protect and grow our franchise. Kyle Peterson : Got it. That\u2019s really helpful color. Thanks, guys. Nice quarter. Mark Begor : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Hamzah Mazari : Good morning. Thank you. My question is just on the fraud and ID business. You had mentioned e-commerce, maybe retail as new verticals with the Kount deal. And at the same time, you talked about scale. Could you maybe talk about whether the fraud and ID business is at scale today? How do you define scale? And just as part of that discussion, you've seen companies like Mastercard recently buy Ekata. Mitek is doing some stuff around ID. Is there a lot more M&A opportunity in this market? Or how do you think about sort of when this business scales or if it's at scale today? Mark Begor : Yes. It's a great question. It's one that's been a deliberate focus of ours. You've heard us talk about it for the last couple of years that it's a fast-growing space, the ID and broad space globally is, I don't know, $18 billion, something like that, growing at 20%. You've seen -- we've had growth there. We've been in it for a long time. We have a lot of existing differentiated data assets at Equifax around ID and fraud and the Kount acquisition was quite strategic for us. They have real scale. And I think as a reminder, they play in the retail e-commerce space. Have real scale around their interactions. I think it's 32 billion consumer interactions per year. They've got 400 million unique e-mail addresses verified. They've got cellphone addresses are verified, IP addresses. So just a wealth of data. And the power is really combining their data with ours. And that's really why we acquired Kount. And as you point out, it also brings us into a new vertical. We weren't in the retail e-commerce space and that's where Kount plays. And, of course, we're going to bring Kount and their data into financial services, banking, telco, insurance, where we play. So that's why we acquired Kount. The answer is yes. You heard me comment earlier this morning on the call that, when we think about new M&A or additional M&A, ID and fraud is a place that we want to continue playing in. We see opportunities. We have opportunities in our pipeline to continue to strengthen the combination of Equifax and Kount going forward. And then when you -- your question of scale, from our perspective, the combination of Equifax and Kount gets us into kind of a strong market position, but it's a huge market at $18 billion. So, there's a lot of room to grow and we look at product introductions. We're investing in like our new Luminate platform, gets us more capabilities organically in this marketplace. And as I mentioned earlier, we're rolling that out. And then acquisitions like Kount really strengthen our data assets and the combination of Equifax and Kount is quite powerful. So, you should look for us over the coming years to find ways to grow. Certainly, we're going to invest organically, but also to invest through M&A to strengthen this. We like the space and we want to be bigger in it. Hamzah Mazari : Gotcha. And my second question, I've asked this before a couple of quarters ago, but I think I'm going to ask it a bit differently. So, if we exclude Workforce Solutions and we just look at USIS and the margin differential just between USIS and international, it's pretty large. And then if you look at your international margin and you compare it to your competitors, there's also a big gap. And so I realize that -- so we're taking Workforce Solutions out of the mix. And so then maybe there's some mix differentials between USIS and international. And I realize international has to get the revenue where you get the incremental margin and the op leverage, and that's maybe in earlier innings. But could you -- how much of the gap can you close between international and USIS and how much of the gap is structural? And we're excluding Workforce Solutions here. Mark Begor : And again, we don't exclude Workforce Solutions, but we'll just do that for your discussion and really focus on those other businesses. Obviously, USIS has real scale, and that scale drives their margins. And that's clearly a big difference when you think about our international. International, we're in 25 countries. We have some larger businesses like Australia, that's over $300 million and then some smaller countries that we play in. So, that drives a difference in the margins between our USIS, which has really massive scale versus our international businesses. We're always focused on improving our margins. The cloud investments that we're making will benefit Workforce Solutions margins, USIS margins and international and GCS margins. That's part of our strategy to improve our cost structure. But there's no question the subscale nature of some of our international markets result in margins being lower, which I would characterize as structural, but we see opportunities to improve those margins going forward. Would you add anything, John? John Gamble : Yes. As you look at the countries we're in, the countries that are looking more like USIS, where they're more specifically, like, for example, Canada, margins are much better, right? And so as Mark said, it really depends on the size of the market and then the diversity of the market that we're playing in. And then -- and so we certainly expect to see improvements in margins as we go to the cloud. But some of it certainly is structural just by the fact that we're in so many markets, and some of those businesses are very small. So, not to get into specific numbers, we do expect to see improvements in those margins over time. But some of it is structural. We have no expectation that they're going to reach the type of margins we see with USIS. Hamzah Mazari : Got it. Thank you. Very helpful. Operator : Okay. The next question is from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Andrew Steinerman : It's Andrew. I wanted to hear about the different areas of U.S. credit applications, meaning card and auto and personal loan with the large pickup in non-mortgage USIS online revenues accelerating to 16% in the first quarter, in particular, I don't think we've heard the credit card issuers talk about loan growth picking up yet, and I just wanted to know if you anticipate that soon? Mark Begor : I think we said, Andrew, that it was fairly broad-based. And some of the marketing spend is card issuers starting to, I would characterize, restart originations but that's the marketing piece. That doesn't necessarily result in loan growth yet. I think that's the -- starting to spend money and starting to put new offers out in the marketplace that presumably would result in some loan growth either in second or third quarter, but there's a lag on that between the marketing spend and when those originations go on their books and become loans. Broadly, I would say, what we hear from the U.S. customers is an element of confidence that wasn't in place certainly for most of 2020, certainly, the early parts of 2021. And I think as we've all seen vaccine rollouts in the United States really accelerate and now really, everyone over age 16 can get one, that's resulting in consumer confidence as we seen it in retail spending. And that you've seen banks in their earnings releasing reserves, so I think there's an element of confidence of we're moving towards a more normal economy. I would say, we're not there yet, but we saw some real increases what I would call in confidence and it's in our numbers in March and as we moved into April. Andrew Steinerman : And auto was strong? Mark Begor : So auto was stronger than card, right? So if you just kind of tier our structure, auto was stronger than card and identity and fraud was also very strong. Andrew Steinerman : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And your next question is from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Craig Huber : Yes, hi. Thank you. I wanted to focus on costs, if I could, please. Can you give us a sense what your hiring plans are this year in terms of full-time equivalent employees? Are you thinking your plans should maybe pick up hire than other say, 5% more employees in the U.S.? That's my first question. Another related question to that is, as we move through this virus things, hopefully get better, your employees will return to the offices and stuff in the U.S., should we expect your cost base to materially go up when that happens? Mark Begor : Yes. First off, Craig, welcome. I think this is your first Equifax call or at least in recent times. So, it's great to have you covering the company. Craig Huber : Yes. Thank you. Mark Begor : On the people side, I would say our employment will be fairly stable. There's some areas where we're investing, like in product resources, in some technology areas. But at the same time, I think you know, we've got plans to reduce some of our technology costs as the cloud transformation unfolds. So, there'll be some reductions in that area, which is in our framework. So, I wouldn't think about big changes in our employment. But you should think about Equifax being on offense, meaning we're investing with our strong performance. And, of course, our acquisitions that we talked about, the five acquisitions bring incremental employees into our headcount, which is in our framework that we've shared with you. With regards to the return to office, we've been open since last June. We've been very careful about that. It's been really up to our team, if they want to come in. We've limited our occupancy to 50%, no more than 50%, and of course, exercising all those protocols. And we've seen in the last -- I don't know, 30 to 60 days as vaccine rollouts have increased, an increase of people coming back to our office. And what we've been telling our employees, when you're vaccinated come back and start operating with Equifax. We also announced post whatever our full reopening is, which is hard to see what that date is. We're going to -- we introduced what we call an Equifax Flex Day, where we're going to have some flexibility in our workforce that they can pick on one day per week with their managers approval to work remotely. And it was really a reflection on that there are many benefits that we learned over the last year that we can be productive from working from home, but so-called 4/1, meaning we're going to work from the office at least four days per week is a reflection that we're a collaborative culture, the teamwork is how we operate, whether it's doing NPIs or technology or new customer solutions, we think that happens best in the office. And to your question about we don't expect our cost to go up. We haven't changed our footprints. We don't expect them to go down as a result of this return to office. John Gamble : And just as you think about our cost structure, just for perspective, right, we're like most technology companies, obviously, a significant portion of our cost structure is our own employees. We also have a very significant footprint of contract employees and contractors, right? So, we end up -- we move cost, but obviously, the contractor workforce is more variable to us. Craig Huber : And then also if I could ask guys, in the U.S., where do you think the biggest opportunity is to be able to raise price steady as each year goes on to - in the U.S. operations? Mark Begor : Yes, we don't talk a lot about price, but if you think about our U.S. businesses, which is really - I'll leave our consumer business aside GCS, but you think about USIS and Workforce Solutions. We focus on new product rollouts that become incremental margin and many times at a higher price point because they're delivering incremental value to the customer. So, that's one way to get revenue pricing margins. Workflow Solutions is clearly our most differentiated business and differentiated data asset and has more ability to bring more value to our customers that we can monetize with different price points of the solutions we're delivering. And if you think about it, if you look at our hit rates now that are over 50%, and you go back two years ago when they were, I don't know, pick the right number, 40%, 50%-plus hit rate is more valuable to our customers, becomes a data asset that they can use more broadly in their solutions. So, Workforce is clearly a business that has more ability to drive its top line through multiple levers that we've talked about a couple of times on this call. Craig Huber : Great. Thank you. Operator : And your next question is from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Toni Kaplan : Thank you so much. Just wanted to ask a bit of a different question on the guide. My interpretation is that it seems like the vast majority of the increase is from the 1Q beat. And then the rest I'm expecting is maybe a better 2Q with 2H in line with your expectations previously. Is that a fair assessment? And I know your mortgage expectations are a little bit lower than before in the rest of the year. It just seems like a lot of your non-mortgage trends are positive. So, I'm just hoping you could provide any extra color on how you're thinking about whether these positive trends continue through the year or not? Thank you. Mark Begor : Yes, I think, Toni, you got to remember, we have seen in the last 60 days, a weakening -- slight weakening of mortgage inquiries, which we rolled into our new framework. So, we took down mortgage by 300 basis points for the year, which we think is prudent, offsetting that and our ability to guide up is that our outsized and strong performance in non-mortgage in the quarter, and our expectation is that will continue. John? John Gamble : Well, if you're looking at revenue, Toni, right, I mean, the over $200 million increase, right, only less than half of it was really out of the first quarter. And then obviously, yes, the second quarter is stronger. And then the third -- as Mark said, third and fourth quarter are impacted somewhat by the much greater decline in the mortgage market. But we are seeing very substantial growth, and we think improvement in the non-mortgage segments. And as you look at revenue, we think a significant amount of the improvement in the guide is from periods after the first quarter. Toni Kaplan : Okay. And then looking at financial marketing, you mentioned the 20% marketing-related growth. Just curious about why there's -- why marketing dollars are being spent there, but within the consumer indirect business you're still seeing pressure. Just wondering what the disconnect is between that and when you expect the indirect business and consumer to show signs of recovery? Mark Begor : Yes. Toni, I think about it quite naturally. What we saw and what I would have done when I was running GE Capital's credit card business is when you get in a tough economy, you tighten up originations and stop spending marketing money. In the first place you stop spending marketing money is with third parties, meaning lead gen companies. Same thing when you come out of a difficult environment, the first place you'll start is your own, you have more confidence in that. It's generally lower cost. It's more efficient desire predictability, and that's what we're seeing. And we do expect our indirect to improve, but it's going to be lag some at least the framework we put together and happened later in the year. Toni Kaplan : Great. Thank you. Operator : And then we'll take the next question from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Andrew Nicholas : Hi, good morning. You\u2019ve touched on it a bit in your prepared remarks, but I was hoping you could walk through the i2Verify acquisition a bit further. How should we think about it contributing to the TWN database in terms of record count? And then relatedly, can you give us a sense for how many other assets like this are out there that could add records to the database in a meaningful way? Certainly, it seems like these types of deals come with some pretty immediate revenue synergies. So, any additional detail on that opportunity set would be helpful? Mark Begor : Yes. There aren't many of them. We know who all of it \u2013 they all are, and we talk to them all the time. There are a handful of companies like i2Verify and HIREtech. And as you may know, you've followed us for a while that we've made acquisitions like this over the last couple, three, four, five years. So, when they're available, we like to make them. And maybe I'll just touch on HIREtech first. HIREtech has what we thought was a very attractive WOTC Solution, particularly delivered through third parties to companies. And again, one of the ways to get records is to deliver value-added services like WOTC, like I-9, like Unemployment Claims like W-2 Management, like ACA to companies. And then in order to complete those services for them, which are regulatory requirements, you get access to records. And in HIREtech's case, we have a WOTC business so today, and - but there was -- we thought very attractive and how they deliver those solutions through partners. And we'd like to grow our partner WOTC business, which not only will bring the records they already have, but get access to records in the future. And, of course, there's a revenue stream just from providing those WOTC services. As John mentioned, they also have an Economic Recovery Credit, ERC, which is a very special and unique credit in 2021 that there's another way to gain access to records, which will benefit us this year. In i2Verify, a bit different in their approach to market. They have a very attractive. We like the team a lot. As we do in HIREtech, the i2Verify team was very advanced around relationships and how they went to market with non-profit organizations, with the healthcare industry or hospitals -- and hospitals and the education or think universities. And there's lots of employees in those kinds of organizations and companies, and they developed a very attractive go-to-market of how they built relationships and delivered those services. And so we like that, which is why we were very attracted to i2Verify, and we're looking for them to really expand our relationships through different services we provide to those kind of companies and then allow us to get records in order to grow our records. And again, at 90 million uniques, we're very pleased with the scale of our database, but there's a lot of runway between 90 million and 155 million. Andrew Nicholas : Great. Makes sense. That's all very helpful. Thank you. And then for my follow-up, you've mentioned 100 basis point improvement in your vitality index expectation a couple of times. I imagine that's primarily a consequence of faster than expected adoption on the new product side. So, I was just kind of hoping you could talk about what's driving that specifically through the first couple of months of the year? And then relatedly, what do you think that pickup in adoption means as you think about the vitality index in 2022 and beyond? And how NPIs are expected to contribute over a longer-term timeframe? Thanks. Mark Begor : Yes. I think you know, we've been pretty clear that we've been talking for well over a year, maybe two years about the power of NPI, and that's not new to Equifax. It's not new to our industry. Our competitors are focused on new products. And it really is the fuel for growth that allows us to grow multiples of GDP. That's the inherent in the data analytics business. And we talked a bunch about our investment in the cloud transformation over the last three years from 2018 through 2020, the $1.5 billion we invested in our new infrastructure, we did that for lots of reasons. Sorry, we get the fire. Operator : Please stand by. [Operator Instructions] Mark Begor : Sorry, we're back. We had a fire alarm go off here, and we just got to shut it off. We're fine. Andrew, sorry, could you repeat your question again? Andrew Nicholas : No problem. I can't -- not surprised if that would throw anyone off. Yes. My question was just on the vitality index and how you might look at 2022 and beyond on that metric given the faster than expected adoption so far this year? Mark Begor : Yes. I think I was talking about the cloud investment. We invested in the cloud because we knew it was going to give us cost benefits, security, a competitive advantage, but we really invested in the cloud to deliver new products and growth. And we've been really focused on that over the last 12, 18 months. We talked last year that we've been expanding our resources in new product capabilities. And we think we're starting to see the leverage of the cloud, our ability to bring new solutions to the marketplace. And our guide up was really \u2013 we increased our NPI rollouts last year to 139, which was a record. We're at 39 in the first quarter, which is up from 35. So, we've got more products in the marketplace. And you've got a commercial team that's out there selling them. So that's why we feel the confidence of increasing the guidance going forward, at least, for 2021. I don't want to get into 2022 guidance. We'll include that in our long-term framework, which we intend to put in place later this year, and the vitality index of new products will be central and really important to us in how we grow the business going forward. Andrew Nicholas : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Adam Parrington : All right. Adam on for Shlomo. Can you talk a little bit more about the unemployment claims strength? Is it from better industry volumes than expected, or does it have more to do with more product sales or more clients? Thanks. A \u2013 Mark Begor : Yes. We've been taking advantage of what's a strong unemployment claims market over the last year and looking for new customer relationships, the teams out there still selling and growing our space. And I think we mentioned we've grown our share slightly to -- we believe, 1-in-3 claims we process versus 1-in-5 maybe in 2020. So, it's just another area of growth we're focused on. And as we also guided, we clearly expect our revenue in 2021 to come down kind of sequentially in the second, third and fourth quarter. But this is a business that is important to Workforce Solutions, processing unemployment claims for companies. It gives us a very nice revenue source long-term. We generally sell these on a subscription basis with limits, if you go over a certain number of claims processed, which is why we've had such strong incremental revenue in the high unemployment market in the last couple of years. But we have a very sophisticated solution that operates well in the marketplace. And remember, the second benefit in processing these claims and having this as a business is it gets us access to records that then we can monetize over in our TWN database in our verification business. Adam Parrington : Thanks. Operator : All right. And your next question is from George Mihalos with Cowen. George Mihalos : Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter and the outlook. I wanted to start off on mortgage. Again, if we look at verification revenues up another 100%, that's well higher than what you saw in the USIS revenue growth. And as a matter of fact, the growth in EWS has stayed kind of consistent at 100% even if when sort of USIS volumes in mortgage have come down. Can you maybe talk a little bit about that decoupling? Is it as simple, a strong record growth? Or is there something else that's allowing you to outperform that massively even when volumes come down a bit on the USIS side? Mark Begor : Yes. I think if you -- we've shown these charts before that Workforce Solutions have been consistently outperforming all markets that they operate in, including the mortgage market. And much more substantially than USIS. They just have more levers. So, they'll use the same levers that USIS use, which is price. So, if you increase price in an up or down market, you're going to have more revenue. New products is one where they just had more opportunities. And you've heard us talk over the last I don't know, four or five quarters about their increased focus on new products. Things like historically, we've had a single report that we'd offer, and now we're offering one with more history on it, 12 months, 24 months, 36 months. And instead of having a report that we sell at $25, we've got price points at $150 and $200, and that provides real value to the mortgage originator. And we rolled out a product that's for co-borrowers. A lot of mortgages in the states that have a dual career couple underwritten -- underwriting the mortgage and so we have a new solution there. Instead of having $225 reports polled, we've got a $200 solution. We've got solutions and new products now that encourage more polls. So, we'll have a solution where we sell it at a higher price point that includes multiple polls. So, new products is a real lever for Workforce Solutions. Of course, records we've talked multiple times in this call, adding records drive set rates. Because remember, we're getting inquiries on those mortgages, all those credit cards or auto loans, but your question was around mortgage. We're getting inquiries for the full database, the full set of consumers. And I say, we only have 90 million uniques. And as we grow that database, those hit rates go up automatically. So, records are a very central part of Workforce Solutions' ability to outgrow the mortgage and all their underlying markets. There's also a large portion of mortgages we don't see still. We only see, I think it's 65% of mortgages. So, we're out in the marketplace talking to those that are not doing business with Equifax and are using pay stubs or some other mechanism for approving the income and employment elements of a mortgage application to use our solution. The move from a customer, we saw a lot of our customers, I think, over one-third that access our data through the web. Meaning they're actually keying in the mortgage applicants social security number, date of birth, name, et cetera. There's a lot of friction there, meaning it doesn't happen in every mortgage application for that originator or we don't get multiple polls. So, going to system-to-system integrations is a big part of our strategy, and we're increasing those system integrations every quarter. We've got a dedicated team that works with mortgage originators to have them do system-to-system integrations. Another lever is the number of polls in a mortgage application. In a credit application -- on the credit side, there's four to five polls in many mortgage applications of the credit file. Historically, there was more like one to two in the income employment data. We're seeing the more sophisticated originators pull our data more often on every mortgage application. And remember, you think about a couple of elements. Number one, it's a big ticket transaction, $250,000, $300,000, $400,000 or more is the loan. And then second is the mortgage originator that's spending $4,000, $5,000 in the application process, they want to make sure that they're spending time on an applicant that they can close on. So, not only verifying their credit multiple times in the process, but making sure that applicant is still working and how much they make as a part of the application process is another big opportunity. So, there's just a half dozen of very strong levers that all have dedicated teams on it, and they've been executing very strongly on those levers. Another kind of overriding macro, if you will, for Workforce Solutions is just really the scale of the database. Now, if you go back at our last economic crisis in 2008, 2009 or pick your year, go back three, four, five years ago, our database in TWN might have been having hit rates of 30% or 40%. Now that we're well over 50%, it becomes a very valuable data asset and all of our customers know that you enhance the credit decisioning of an applicant, if you add is someone working and how much do they make to their credit file. That drives predictability. And so, when you have a database that almost is at a catalyst or an inflection point of going over 50%, we think that's another positive factor. Of course, we've got a lot of opportunity and a lot of work to do in workforce. And we're quite optimistic about the long-term impact of our fastest-growing business with margins and revenue growth rates that are highly accretive to Equifax. George Mihalos : Okay. That's super comprehensive. So really appreciate that. And just really quickly, Mark, maybe going back to Andrew's question, on the FMS side, the increase that you're seeing in marketing for card solicitations and the like. Is it too early to know, if the success rate or the hit rate for the banks are in line with what they saw historically as they rolled out those programs? Mark Begor : Yes. We wouldn't have visibility to that. But what -- I'll tell you what we do find is that all of our finance \u2013 this is a macro that started before COVID is that all applications, all uses of data, whether it's in banking, credit cards, mortgage, auto, lending, telco, all of our customers want to use more data. And they want to use more differentiated and alternative data because it enhances the predictability of the decision they're making. And let's use originations. And that's why you're seeing more alternative data being used. We think our cloud transformation is going to differentiate us and the ability to house that data to \u2013 and as well as surface and deliver that data to our customers. And then, of course, TWN, we talked earlier in this conversation in the call this morning about the power of that data set in that credit decisioning, meaning, is someone working, how much are they making added to the credit file and the other alternative data is very, very powerful. George Mihalos : Thank you. Operator : And the next question is from Simon Clinch with Atlantic Equities. Simon Clinch : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I just wondered if -- first off, so apologies, I was actually dropped off on my Internet connection during this call. And I was wondering if you could just refresh me on the growth targets for 2021 for the segments that you laid out, please? Mark Begor : Sure, Simon. We had a dropped off, too. We had a fire alarm go off, but there was not a fire. So we were off for a few minutes, too. Do you want to go a little bit on it? It\u2019s just the growth rates by segment that we raised earlier. Yes. Okay, sure. John Gamble : Yes, yes, because that used us in... Mark Begor : So we indicated that we expected Workforce Solutions to be up over 20%. We indicated we expected USIS to be up mid to high single digits. We indicated we expected international to be up constant currency high single digits and that we expected GCS to be down mid-single digits and also expected GCS to be down mid-single digits in the second quarter. Simon Clinch : Okay. Great. So, I was wondering, if I could follow-on on that, just on the international business then. I mean, this is -- obviously, with what happened through the pandemic because the comparisons are incredibly easy. And given sort of where we're expecting the framework you provided for a recovery out of the pandemic at the back end of this year. I'm curious as to sort of how sensitive do you think about that sort of high single-digit number is? Because it seems to me it should be fairly easy in some ways to drive significantly higher growth for this -- for the international segment. I'm just wondering if you could give a little bit of color around that. Mark Begor : Yes, I would say, Simon, we're counting on a recovery of the international markets, but I think there's still a pretty decent amount of uncertainty in those markets. And you follow it, too, but Canada's vaccine rollout is really slow. And they've got lockdowns back in place in other markets. Australia's vaccine rollout is like really slow, like, not happening. I'm not sure when they're going to get a vaccine rollout. So, there when kind of locked down, there's still pressure on that economy. UK, they've got the vaccines out there, but they've still got high COVID cases. So, we've got lockdowns in the UK. With some other markets, a big market for us like Chile, they used, I think, the Chinese vaccine that turns out to be not effective. So, it rolled out. So, they've got lockdowns in place. So, I think the -- we expect them to recover. We expect the vaccines to get in place during 2021, but I think there's still some uncertainty there. And in our framework, we do -- we are counting on and expect to see some improvement. And you saw in our numbers, we've got some markets that are adapting to COVID, like the U.S. did. I think some of the international markets took longer to adapt, meaning the U.S. in some markets like auto and others in second and third quarter last year figured out how to sell cars virtually and other things. That happened more slowly from our perspective in international markets, but you're starting to see that. Canada had a very strong quarter for us in the first quarter. Australia did too, even notwithstanding these COVID lockdowns. So, we expect international to improve, but I'd say that we're watching it because there's still some uncertainty there. John Gamble : And remember, our fourth quarter of 2020 in international was okay. We grew in the fourth quarter of 2020, right? So\u2026 Simon Clinch : Yes. John Gamble : Yes. Simon Clinch : Of course. Okay. I was wondering if I could just have a quick follow-up as well. And maybe just one more for you, John. Just when I think about the push and pull for the USIS margins going forward, because I know you don't break out the tech transition costs by quarter, but when I think about the underlying incremental margins of this business. I mean, could you give me a little color how to think about that? And then layer on top, the potential dilution from acquisitions to margins and how we should think about that beyond once we move beyond that sort of the year post those deals? John Gamble : Yes. So we did give some perspective, right, on USIS this quarter. We indicated kind of the negative movement in their margins was up two-thirds driven by tech transformation, so to give you some perspective. And what we said is over the longer-term, we expect to see improvements in margins, driven by the fact that we're going to drive substantial cost benefits related to the tech transformation. But we wouldn't start to see those benefits occur until late 2021 and then really kicking in, in earnest in 2022. So, as we think about the movement in margins, the drivers of the margin, obviously, will be as tech transformation spend start to decline as you move through 2021 and into 2022, really moving into 2022. And then as we start to get savings related to those decommissionings that will occur as tech transformation completes, and that doesn't really start to have a net savings of decommissioning more than cloud costs until very late in 2021 and then obviously accelerating in 2022. Simon Clinch : Okay. And so incremental costs from acquisitions that you've already made are really going to be minimal? John Gamble : So, we expect acquisitions we make to move to USIS-type margins over a reasonable period of time, right? So, certainly not in the first year. But then as we move into year two and certainly year three, we expect them to deliver margins like the rest of the business. Mark Begor : And the acquisitions are all accretive to generally, our revenue growth rates in each of the businesses. For example, Kount, we're really excited about the space they play in and their historical growth and the opportunities with the synergies between USIS and Kount on both the top line and some of the cost synergies. Simon Clinch : Yes. Understood. Thank you. Operator : And the next question is from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities. Andrew Jeffrey : Hey, good morning. Appreciate taking the question. I know it's been kind of a long call. Just very high level, Mark. What I'd like to try to understand, if you can help is, just simplistically, how much do you think of your non-mortgage strength, in particular, is being driven by a snapback in share gain? Obviously, there was a period of time over the last few years where Equifax was focused internally. And you\u2019ve clearly ridden the ship and accelerated NPI and are making what is apparently a very effective cloud transition. Are we seeing normalization in share? How much of that is playing a role in this growth, non-mortgage and mortgage in that matter, just broadly? Mark Begor : Yeah. I think we tried to be clear and we used this phrase last year for -- I think all four quarters last year that we feel like based on the wins, the USIS and Sid Singh and his team are landing in the U.S. marketplace in USIS space that we're competitive and we're winning in the marketplace. We've talked about the deal pipeline. We shared some metrics earlier in the call that it's up 30%. And so, what are the factors there? There's no question, we were pressured in 2018 and 2019 after the cyber event competitively. We were in the penalty box with a lot of customers. It took us a while to get out of them, meaning through the end of 2019. In 2020, we were on, what I would characterize in the first quarter, kind of, a normal competitive footing and then COVID hit, which created some visibility challenges, perhaps for you. But in that time frame, we kept a consistent dialogue with you that USIS was winning and was competitive in the marketplace. So you've got the commercial -- the post cyber event is clearly behind us. We're on our strong footing commercially. We think we're advantaged commercially with the cloud transformation. When you think about it, it's actually quite logical. If you're a commercial leader and you're out talking to one of your customers and say, hey, Equifax just invested $1.5 billion in our technology to support you. That creates a very positive dialogue. And then you add to it Equifax's differentiated data assets that we have, data assets, our competitors don't, which we think helps us commercially. And you can lead with TWN, obviously, which, as you know, USIS sells in the marketplace for us is one commercial team. They sell TWN to all our financial customers. And then add to it, NCTUE, IXI, DataX. So we think that\u2019s advantaging us. The leveraging of the cloud for new products is clearly taking hold. USIS is -- the rest of the business rolling out these new cloud-based products that we think are giving us an ability to bring new solutions to drive incremental revenue with our customers in the mortgage and non-mortgage space, which is quite positive. So we think there's a lot of momentum. There\u2019s still more to do. But the team is really focused. I think the last point I'd raise is that, we brought in no longer, a new leader, two years ago, Sid Singh, but he used 2019 to rebuild the business and the team and continue that in 2020, they're hitting on their strides. We relever the team. We've got a new Chief Revenue Officer. We've got Sid, who's a very commercially oriented leader. I think that's benefiting USIS also in how they're operating in the marketplace. Andrew Jeffrey : Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe for John, just quickly. Any kind of unusual timing items we should be thinking about, John? I mean, just it seems like EWS mortgage is holding up really well as the mortgage market kind of weaken. Is there any sort of timing vis-\u00e0-vis your growth versus the market as a whole? John Gamble : The time you would be aware of, which I'm sure you're aware of because it happens every year, right, in EWS and Employer Services. The Employer Services revenue was strongest in the first quarter substantially because several of the services they provide, think W-2, think workforce analytics are directly related to tax filings. And since that's the case, their revenue is much higher in those segments in the first quarter. And during that period, obviously, the margins are very strong in those businesses. So you see stronger margin in Workforce Solutions. And it also obviously benefits Equifax in the first quarter. And generally, there's a negative trend sequentially going into the second quarter for that reason. The other thing that just timing related, related to Equifax is our annual salary increases, our merit increases are generally pretty much uniformly at April 1st. So, you tend to see a cost increase occur in the company in the second quarter, okay? And that brings margins down, okay? So those are two things that are just timing-related. But other than that, no, I think we're just what we're seeing in EWS and really across the business is just good execution. Andrew Jeffrey : Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : And the next question is from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. George Tong : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Your guidance for 2021 core revenue growth was upwardly revised from 10.5% previously to 16% at the midpoint. Approximately how much of the increase in core revenue growth the estimate is coming from non-mortgage compared to outperformance within the mortgage market? Mark Begor : Remember, we took our mortgage guidance down, so you should think about that. That clearly is a negative impact on that. And the whole offset is from nonmortgage is why we're raising it. John? John Gamble : Yeah. So George, we've said pretty consistently, right, that as we move through 2021, you're going to see an increasing contribution to core revenue growth from non-mortgage relative to mortgage. Obviously, in the first quarter, we saw really good outperformance relative to the mortgage market across EWS as well as USIS, and we indicated I think in an earlier answer to a question that even though the mortgage market is going to be weaker by 3 points in the year, we'll still grow faster than 10%, right? So we're going to see better performance, better outperformance relative to the market than we had previously guided. So there is some benefit to core revenue growth from better outperformance in the mortgage market. But, obviously, also you're seeing a substantial contribution now that's starting to occur as you move through 2021 from the non-mortgage market. George Tong : Got it. Very helpful. And then secondly, Equifax hasn't yet reinstated its long-term financial framework. What do you need to see in the business before you feel comfortable reinstating long-term target? Mark Begor : Yeah, George, we talked to you before and I was clear earlier in the discussion this morning that we're intending to put that in place in 2021. We said in February and kind of same comment to you now is that we wanted to see a few more quarters -- a few more months perhaps of the COVID recovery. Things are still -- volatile is the wrong word, but still evolving. The mortgage market from just, I don't know, less than 90 days ago is - has softened. And, of course, the COVID recovery, I would say, is stronger than we anticipated in the last 60 days in the non-mortgage side. So, we want to see a few more months of that, but we know what we want to do. We're ready to do it. We've given, hopefully, you a lot of indications of how that's going to be framed. And it's our intention to put that in place in concert with likely an Investor Day. In \u2013 before the end of the year in 2021. George Tong : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : And the next question is from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Jeff Meuler : Yes. Thank you. So my question is on Slide 9 and the middle chart, EWS core mortgage growth. So, it was 99%. And I think you have 9% records growth. So it's a 90% core ex records growth, mortgage growth and verification services. If I look back to 2020, it also had this massive step up, 80%, maybe high 60s or 70x records growth. It used to be in this -- I guess, 11% to 21% range and probably half or more than half of that was record. So there's a much bigger contribution starting in 2020 from those ex records factors. And Mark, you repeated several times, all of the factors that go into that. So, I don't need you to repeat that. But what is so different about 2020 and going into 2021 in terms of -- like, I don't know if it's the inflection, if it's the tech transformation, like if it's a specific factor, just what's so different about 2020 and 2021 in that regard? Mark Begor : I think there's a couple of things there, Jeff. And we've said to you and others repeatedly, there is a degree of inflection point. When you're north of 50% kind of hit rates, we think it becomes a more valuable asset in so many other cases. And I'll just use my example, 10 years ago, when I was at GE Capital, we didn't use the data asset because the hit rates were, I don't know, 25%. It just didn't make sense to put it in your workflows when you can only hit 1-and-4 customers. Now that you're over 50, we believe there's an element of inflection there. We also believe that cloud transformation is a big deal. And that's across Equifax, but workforce is benefiting from that. For example, ingesting the amount of records, but even more complex is ingesting the amount of employers that we now have in the data set. If you go back 18 months ago, we may have had 150,000 employers or 200,000, something like that. And now we're well over 1 million companies contributing a data set. We couldn't have done that without the cloud. And remember, when we get those data records, they're generally in different formats, and your cloud capabilities allow you to normalize those and then put them in a format that you can bring them to your customers. And then I won't go through all of the other levers that workforce has. But you know, they're pretty wide and broad. And with the scale of the business, meaning the infrastructure we have, the people, we have the resources to invest in really dedicated teams. And I don't mean to repeat this, but we have a dedicated team focused on records, period. That's hard to do. And this is a multi-person team. We have a dedicated team focused on working with our mortgage customers on system-to-system integrations. That's all they do on the benefits. We have another team that's focused on convincing the mortgage originators that aren't doing business to go forward with us. The scale of our business almost becomes a flywheel that allows us to invest in the business. So, I think there's all those, just going back up, what are the bigger macros. It's -- I would say, the inflection point of being north of 50 and the cloud transformation taking hold. And if you followed us for a long time, you know that on a new product front, you didn't hear a lot out of Workforce Solutions in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 around new products. Now, with the cloud, we can really take advantage of this data asset. And you know the power of coming up with a new way to monetize a data asset that you've already paid for, meaning the dual borrower mortgage solution; the mortgage solution that allows a mortgage originator to have multiple pools. The mortgage solution that has 36 months of history in it at a higher price point. Those are all opportunities that we've started to deploy in 2020 when we had the EFX Cloud really taking hold inside of workforce and across Equifax. And those are the kind of solutions, you should see. And as you know, central to our EFX2023 strategy is really leveraging the cloud around innovation and new products and we're excited about our progress there. But we're in early innings on this. Jeff Meuler : Got it. Thanks, Mark. John Gamble : And, Jeff, just part of it, just penetrating, right? We talked about three years ago, for every four credit pools, there was one or less than one employer pool, right? verifications pool. Now, for every two, there's more than one, right? So the level of penetration is up dramatically in the time period you're describing, which substantially adds to growth, right? And then you also know, obviously, in a period of very rapidly growing market benefit, all variances improved, right? So, we'll certainly benefit across the business by the fact that the market is so large, right, but the -- and grew so much faster this year. But the increase in penetration is a huge driver in the past three years. Jeff Meuler : Got it. Helpful. Thank you. Operator : And your next question is from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Mark Begor : Hey, Kevin. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Thanks so much. Hey, how are you? Hey, Mark or John, can you give us a sense just given the new product innovation, how are we thinking about if this is more from a longer-term subscription perspective versus transactions. And I think there's always been historical that this is much more transaction-oriented. Given the incremental cloud shift, it seems like you're going to be more embedded in your clients, you're introducing more products that become more monitoring. So, how are you thinking about subscription versus transaction growth maybe historically? And where that can be in the business longer-term? Mark Begor : Yes. So, I think our business continues to be heavily transaction focused and likely will continue to be. What -- increasingly, you see minimums in our contracts, but generally not subscriptions, right? We do have some products that are subscriptions, like you said, monitoring services tend to look more like subscriptions. But the vast majority of our revenue generation continues to be driven by -- continues to be driven by transactions. And we benefited from that, obviously, very substantially over the past several years. Businesses where you can -- where you see more things that look like subscriptions are, certainly the unemployment insurance claims business, you see things that look like subscriptions with minimum -- with volume caps in them. So, we have businesses that are structured like that. And we have some businesses that are somewhat more software-focused, where you see more subscriptions. But generally speaking, we're still heavily transaction-based and that will likely continue. Kevin McVeigh : That's helpful. And then can you just remind us, if think about the pool of records within EWS. I know that the target is, I remember, has kind of been about $158 million. But as you think about alternative income sources, things like that, what's the total addressable market you think that's potentially out there based on the capabilities that you have today? Mark Begor : Yeah. You talked about the non-farm payroll. There's a lot of runway there, and as you know, a lot of economic value as we grow the database in the traditional non-farm payroll or W-2 income. 1099 is a very big market. I think it's 30 million or 40 million people that have 1099-type income. That's a space that we're adding data records. We don't talk about those, because it's not in our $90 million or $150 million in total. Another data set that we're starting to add, and we have some records now is pensioner income. I think there's 20 million or 30 million defined benefit pensioners in the United States that receive monthly pension checks, either at the state, federal or corporate level. They're applying for credit products. So that's another data set that we're out there chasing. It just goes back to the power of the scale of our business, we have those relationships. For example, a company that we're collecting their active employees from many of those companies also process their pensioner income. So it's an opportunity for us to bring that income into our data set. Same thing with a payroll processor that's doing primarily W-2 income, they're also, in some cases can have 1099 income. So it's another way for us to build those out. So we've got a very clear focus of not only building out W-2, but going beyond that. Another focus that's in early stages is really just getting data around someone logging in or checking in and checking out of their employment, whether it's a restaurant worker logging in through their software that they use to operate in the restaurant, getting that data asset. We might not know how much they're making, but we'll know they're working. So it's another element of data. So we've got a broad focus there around going beyond W-2. Kevin McVeigh : Thank you very much. Operator : And our last question is from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Securities. Gary Bisbee : I appreciate you sticking around long enough to answer the question. Just one on the non-mortgage acceleration, which was impressive across the businesses. When I look at USIS, in particular, I don't think that's grown meaningfully in a couple of years. And if I heard you right, ex the acquisitions, it was nearly 11% year-to-year growth in the quarter. Would it be reasonable to think a decent portion of that is an easy comp in March? And -- or is this much more momentum that's really picked up? And if so, what are the key one or two drivers of that sequential improvement in the non-mortgage growth in USIS? Thank you, Mark Begor : Gary, you know this and just remember is that, USIS had a decent quarter in first quarter last year. I think was that 3.5%. John Gamble : It was certainly, it was low single digits. Mark Begor : Yeah, something like that in the first quarter last year. And the COVID pandemic really didn't hit them or us until the last two weeks of March. And that 3.5% was inside of the two weeks in March, which really were significantly impacted. So we felt quite good about the progress we have really all through 2020 that the team is really delivering. You've got a lot of factors there. We've already talked about it a bunch in the call about the commercial focus by the team. We think that's real. We think they're getting benefits already from the cloud transformation competitively, meaning wanting to do business with Equifax because we have a different technology infrastructure than our competitors. So that's a positive for them, whether it's on share. You can think about other factors like the NPIs. Those are -- a reminder, we were building NPIs in 2018 and 2019. We really couldn't sell them because we were in the penalty box. We started selling them in 2020, but that's really benefiting them, and we're continuing to accelerate our NPI rollouts. So I think that's a benefit for the business. And then there's an element of COVID recovery. I think we were clear that in March and April, we've seen some of their verticals move back much more strongly than they were earlier in the quarter and certainly stronger than they were in 2020. So I think that's part of that, too. Gary Bisbee : So would it be safe to say that the step function element of just dramatically better-looking growth has more to do with -- you've been making progress, but the COVID impact through much of last year sort of offset that or we couldn't see it through because of progression of that? Mark Begor : Correct. I think that's fair. I think that\u2019s fair that the COVID environment masks their performance, which is why every quarter, we talked about their deal pipeline to at least give you a metric that we look at on what their commercial activity looks like. Gary Bisbee : Thank you. John Gamble : And I think, as Mark mentioned on the call, right, it got better each month, right? So March was certainly by far the strongest month of the three. Gary Bisbee : Thank you. Operator : All right. There appears to be no further questions at this time. Mr. Hare, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Dorian Hare : Thanks, everybody, for your interest in Equifax and for joining us today. This does conclude our first quarter earnings call. We look forward to joining you later on this summer to review our second quarter results. Operator : This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to Dorian Hare, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Dorian Hare : Thanks, and good morning. Welcome to today\u2019s conference call. I am Dorian Hare. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today on the IR Calendar section of the News & Events tab at our IR our website www.investor.equifax.com. During the call today, we will be making references to certain materials that can also be found in the presentation section of the News &Events tab at our IR website. These materials are labeled Q2 2021 Earnings Conference Call. During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements including third quarter and full year 2021 guidance to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Certain risk factors that may impact our business are set forth in our filings with the SEC, including our 2020 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. Also, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our website. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark. Mark Begor : Thanks, Dorian, and good morning. Before I address Equifax's strong second quarter results, I want to recognize our 11,000 associates around the globe for their continued hard work and dedication in these challenging times. Our team members are our most important asset and they play a vital role in helping millions of consumers around the world to get access to credit.  On July 1, we opened all of our U.S. offices fully and rolled out our new Equifax flex program, a hybrid working environment that gives our team the opportunity to work from home one day per week. Our four one program recognizes our learnings from the past year around remote work during COVID, but maintains the core of our Equifax culture of collaboration and team work that is optimized by an in-person work environment.  We\u2019ve also resumed in-person meetings with our customers and I\u2019ve been energized with the conversations that have taken place so far. It\u2019s great to be moving back to a new normal.  We had a very strong second quarter and first half, which built off our strong outperformance in 2020. Our team has executed extremely well against the critical priorities of our new Equifax 2023 strategy, which is shown on Slide 4. We are accelerating new product introductions, beginning to leverage our expanding Equifax cloud capabilities, and our highly differentiated data assets. We continue to expand our differentiated data assets both organically and through acquisition and partnerships. While still in the early days, our new Equifax cloud data and technology capabilities are providing competitive advantages and capabilities that only Equifax can provide.  And our Customer First initiatives are deepening our relationships with customers and delivering new products and solutions along with above market Equifax growth. And as always we remain focused on extending our leadership in security. Our EFX2023 growth strategy is our compass for the future and drives all of our growth initiatives as we move through the second half and into 2022 and beyond. We expect this focus to drive our top-line and bottom-line in the future.  Turning now to Slide 5. Equifax\u2019s financial performance in the second quarter was very strong and outperformed our underlying markets. Revenue of $1.235 billion was the highest quarterly revenue in our history breaking the record from last quarter. Local currency revenue growth of 23% and organic local currency growth of 20% were both very strong in some of the highest growth rates in our history.  Our U.S. B2B businesses and Workforce Solutions and USIS which together represent over 70% of our revenue, again drove our overall growth delivering very strong 25% total and 22% organic revenue growth despite the headwinds from the mortgage market that declined about 5%. The 5% decline in the mortgage market was about 500 basis points more than our flat expectation we shared with you in April.  U.S. B2B organic non-mortgage growth of 20% accelerated sequentially from the 16% we delivered in the first quarter. The 20% organic growth is also a record and reflects the underlying strength of Workforce Solutions and USIS\u2019s return to a competitive position.  I\u2019ll cover the BU performance \u2013 level of performance in detail in a moment, but at a high level, Workforce Solutions again led Equifax growth with revenue up a strong 40%. And as a reminder, this is of growth of 53% in second quarter last year and the mortgage that declined 5% in the quarter. USIS delivered another strong quarter with revenue up 11%, driven by non-mortgage total revenue growth of over 20% and strong organic revenue growth of 14%. International delivered a very strong quarter of COVID recovery with revenue growth of 25% in local currency and importantly, all regions internationally delivered growth above 20%. Slightly better than expected GCS revenue was down 3% in local currency. However, our Consumer Direct revenue delivered 11% growth in the quarter, its second consecutive quarter in double-digits.  Second quarter Equifax adjusted EBITDA totaled $431 million, up 20% with margins of 34.9%. Margins were down 160 basis points versus last year due to the inclusion of the cloud technology transformation cost in our adjusted results in 2021, which were excluded last year. This negatively impacted second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin by 310 basis points.  Adjusting for cloud transformation cost of $38 million in the quarter, our margins would have been up a strong 150 basis points. We are getting strong leverage out of our above-market revenue growth.  Adjusted EPS of $1.98 per share was up a strong 21% from last year. Again adjusting for the cloud transformation cost, adjusted EPS would have been up a very strong 36% reflecting the strong performance in operating leverage of Equifax. During the quarter, we continue to make significant progress with the Equifax Cloud Data and Technology transformation including an additional 7,700 customer migrations to the cloud in the United States and more than 900 migrations internationally. We remain on track with our cloud transformation and are confident in our plan.  We continue to expect that North American transformation to be principally complete in early 2022 with the remaining customer migrations completed by the end of next year. International transformation will follow North America being principally completed by the end of 2023. And as you know, last year we started to ramp up our focus in resources on new products leveraging the new Equifax Cloud Data and Capabilities. In the second quarter, we released 46 new products, which is up almost 2x from the 24 products we released a year ago in the quarter. These new products are increasingly leveraging the new Equifax cloud to deliver better data decisioning for our customers.  Driving NPIs, leveraging the new Equifax cloud is central to our EFX2023 growth strategy and we continue to expect our vitality index defined as revenue from new products introduced in the last three years to exceed 8%, a big step up from the 5% last year and a reflection of the strong product focus across EFX.  Our first half performance exceeded our expectations and we are clearly seeing continued strong momentum as we move into the second half. Based on our strong first half results and confidence in the future, we increased our full year revenue guidance by $165 million to a midpoint of $4.78 billion, which is up 400 basis points which is 16% growth. We also increased our full year adjusted EPS guidance by $0.45 per share to a midpoint of $7.35 per share, which adjusting for the technology transformation cost is up 700 basis points to 19% growth. This includes our expectation if the U.S. mortgage market is measured by credit enquiries will decline approximately 8% in the year, which is consistent with the guidance we provided in April.  In the second quarter, Equifax core revenue growth, the green section of the bars on Slide 6 accelerated to 29%. This is up significantly from the 20% core revenue contribution we delivered in the first quarter and 11% in the fourth quarter and well above our historical core growth rates. While our outperformance in the mortgage market continues to drive significant core growth, the contribution from U.S. non-mortgage and international increased significantly in the quarter reflecting approximately 50% of core revenue growth in the quarter, excluding acquisitions and FX favorability.  Turning now to Slide 7, our strong second quarter results were broad based and reflect better than expected performance for all four Equifax business units. Workforce Solutions, our largest business had another exceptional quarter delivering 40% revenue growth and 58% adjusted EBITDA margins. Again as a reminder, the 40% revenue growth is on top of 53% growth last year in the second quarter. EWS is cementing itself as our largest and most valuable business and it\u2019s powering our results representing 40% of total Equifax revenue in the quarter. EWS Verification Services revenue of $395 million was up a strong 57%. Verification Services\u2019 mortgage revenue grew 52% in the quarter, despite the 5% decline in the mortgage market from increased records, penetration and new products.  Importantly, Verification Services\u2019 non-mortgage revenue was up over 60% in the quarter and up over 15% sequentially from the first quarter. Our government vertical which provides solutions to federal and state governments in support of assistance programs including food and rental support grew over 10% in the quarter. Government remains one of our largest non-mortgage segments representing about a third of non-mortgage verification revenue.  We continue to expand our products and solutions in the government vertical and expect our new social security administration contract to go live this quarter with revenue ramping to a $40 million to $50 million runrate in 2022.  Talent Solutions, which comprise income and employment verifications, as well as other information for the hiring and onboarding process through our EWS Data Hub had another outstanding quarter from customer expansion and MGIs growing over 200%. Talent Solutions now represents almost 30% of non-mortgage verification revenue.  Building out the EWS Data Hub that leverages the work history in our TWN database with other unique data elements used in the hiring process is a priority for us. Over 75 million people change jobs in the U.S. annually with the vast majority having some level of screening as a part of that hiring process.  Our non-mortgage consumer business principally in banking and auto showed strong growth of about 50% in the quarter as well, both from deepening penetration with lenders and some recovery in these markets. Debt Management also returned to growth in the quarter.  Employer Services revenue of $101 million was about flat in the quarter as expected. Combined, our unemployment claims and employee retention credit businesses had revenue of about $64 million, down over 15% from last year.  Substantial declines in UC revenue in the second quarter were partially offset by new ERC revenue that began in the quarter as we support businesses in obtaining federal employee retention credit payments. Employer Services non-UC and ERC businesses had revenue up over 50% in the quarter. Our I-9 business driven by our new I-9 Anywhere product continue to show very strong growth, up over 50%. Our I-9 business is now almost half of Employer Services non-UC and ERC revenue. Reflecting on the growth in I-9 and the return to growth of Workforce Analytics, we expect Employer Services non-UC and ERC businesses to deliver organic growth of over 20% for the year.  Reflecting the power and uniqueness of the TWN dataset, strong verifier revenue growth and operating leverage resulted in adjusted EWS EBITDA margins of 68%, a 160 basis point expansion from last year. Excluding technology transformation expenses, EWS margins would have been up over 240 basis points.  Rudy Ploder and EWS team delivered another outstanding quarter and are position to deliver a very strong 2021. Workforce Solutions is our most powerful and unique business and is calling Equifax results would grow substantially above the rest of the company. Turning now to USIS, they had another strong quarter with revenue up 11% driven by strong performance across the business. Total USIS mortgage revenue of $160 million was down about 2% in the quarter, while mortgage enquiries were down 5%, below the flat expectation we shared at April.  John will cover our updated view of the mortgage markets shortly. USIS mortgage revenue outgrew the market by over 300 basis points driven by growth in marketing and debt monitoring products.  Importantly, non-mortgage revenue performance was up 21% with strong organic growth of 14%. This performance reflects the commercial focus of Sid Singh and his team and their competitive position in the marketplace. Importantly, organic non-mortgage revenue also delivered strong sequential growth acceleration of 250 basis points from the first quarter's 11%, an important indicator of the continued strengthening of the USIS business. Banking and Insurance, both grew over 20% in the quarter. Auto and Direct-to-Consumer were both up over 10% and Telco and Commercial were just about flat in the quarter. Financial Marketing Services revenue, which is broadly speaking, our offline or batch business was $59 million in the quarter and up about 14%. The strong performance was driven by marketing-related revenue, which is up over 20% and ID and fraud revenue growth of over 15%, as consumer marketing and originations ramped up coming out of COVID. In 2021, marketing-related revenue is expected to represent about 40% of FMS revenue, identity and fraud above 20% and risk decisioning about 35%. This strong growth across our non-mortgage business is encouraging as we move into the third quarter and the rest of 2021. The USIS new deal pipeline remains very strong and comparable to the strong levels we've seen so far in 2021. We have seen the highest growth in auto, financial services and mortgage. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 40.3% in the quarter, the decline of 380 basis points from second quarter last year was principally due to the cost related with cloud transformation, both the cost of redundant systems and the inclusion in our adjusted results of the technology transformation cost, which were being excluded in 2020. Sales and marketing expenses also increased in the quarter and sequentially to leverage both the stronger U.S. markets and increased NPI rollouts to drive growth. Shifting now to international, the revenue was up a strong 25% on a local currency basis, which is a third consecutive quarter of growth in our global markets. Revenue growth was up over 20% in all of our markets in Canada, Asia-Pacific, Latin America and Europe. Asia-Pacific, which is principally our Australia business, had a very strong quarter with revenue up $91 million or up about 21% in local currencies. Australia consumer revenue turned positive and was up 23% versus last year and up about 2% sequentially. Our commercial business combined online and offline revenue was up a very strong 26% in the quarter and almost 18% - up almost 18% sequentially. Fraud and Identity was up 30% in the quarter following 15% growth in the first quarter.  European revenues of $68 million were up 27% in local currency in the quarter. Our European Credit Reporting business is up about 20% with strong growth in both the UK and Spain. In UK, which is our largest European market, we saw growth of over 25% in Consumer, Data Analytics and scores and over 40% growth in commercial.  Our European debt management business revenue increased about 30% in local currency, off the lows we saw in the second quarter last year during the COVID recession.  Canada delivered record-setting revenue of $47 million in the quarter, up about 26% in local currency. Consumer online was up about 26% in the quarter, an improvement of 12 percentage points from the first quarter. Double-digit growth in commercial, analytical and decision solutions and ID and Fraud also drove growth in the Canadian revenue in the quarter.  Latin American revenues of $44 million grew 30% in the quarter in local currency, which was the second consecutive quarter of growth coming out of COVID. We continue to see the benefits in Latin America of the strong new product introductions the team has rolled out over the past three years.  International adjusted EBITDA margins of 27.3% were up 540 basis points from last year, driven by leverage on revenue growth and continued very good cost control by the international team. Excluding the impact of the inclusion of the technology transformation costs in adjusted EBITDA, margins were up over 750 basis points. Global Consumer Solutions revenue was down 2% on a reported basis and 3% on a local currency basis in the quarter and slightly above our expectations. We again saw strong double-digit growth in our Global Consumer Direct business, which sells directly to consumers through equifax.com and which represents a little over half of GCS revenue. Direct-to-Consumer revenue was up a strong 11% in the quarter, their fourth consecutive quarter of growth.  The decline in overall GCS revenue in the second quarter was again driven by our U.S. lead generation partner business. We expect the GCS partner business and GCS business overall to return to growth in the fourth quarter. GCS adjusted EBITDA margins of 22.5% were up just about 170 basis points, which was better than our expectations. Turning now to Slide 8, Workforce Solutions continues to power Equifax and is clearly our strongest fastest growing and most valuable business. Workforce Solutions revenue grew a very strong 40% in the quarter with core revenue growth of 46%. And again, the 40% growth in the quarter was on top of 53% growth in the second quarter last year. This above-market performance is driven by the uniqueness of the TWN income and employment data, the scale of the TWN database and the consistent execution by Rudy and his team. At the end of the second quarter, TWN reached 119 million active records, an increase of 13% or 14 million records from a year ago and included 91 million unique records. At 91 million uniques, we now have over 60% of non-farm payrolls, which makes our TWN dataset more valuable to our customers by delivering higher hit rates.  Beyond focusing on adding the over 50 million non-farm payroll records not in the TWN database yet, we're also focused on adding data records from the 40 million to 50 million Gig workers and around 30 million pension recipients in the United States marketplace to further broaden the TWN database. We have plenty of room to grow. We are now receiving contributions from 1.2 million companies across the U.S., up from 27,000 employers a short two plus years ago. And as a reminder, over 60% of our records are contributed directly by employers that EWS provides comprehensive employer services to like unemployment claims, W-2 management, I-9, WOTC, Employee Retention Credit, HSA and other HR and compliance-related solutions. These relationships have been built up over the past decade by the Workforce Solutions team. The remaining 35% are contributed through partnerships with payroll providers and HR software companies, most of which are exclusive. The exclusive arrangement with a major payroll processor that we announced on our February call is still on track to become active later this year. We have a dedicated team with an active pipeline of record additions to continue to expand our TWN database in the future. And as you know, as we add records to the dataset, they are monetized almost instantly with our customer system-to-system integrations interacting with our TWN database.  Workforce Solutions continues to grow, penetration in key existing markets while expanding into new markets. We continue to increase our penetration in the mortgage market. As of the most recent data available at the end of 2020, Workforce Solutions received an inquiry in almost 60% of completed U.S. mortgages, which is up from 55% in 2019. This 500 basis point increase shows a continuation of growth in TWN mortgage penetration, as well as the substantial opportunity for continued growth that exist in mortgage with only 60% of mortgages using TWN data today. We are also seeing substantial growth in TWN in the non-credit markets of Government and Talent Solutions as well as increased TWN usage within the card and auto verticals.  As we discussed in the past, growing system-to-system integrations is a key lever in driving both increased penetration and the increased number of polls per transaction for Workforce Solutions. During the quarter, about 75% of TWN mortgage transactions were fulfilled system-to-system, which was up 2x from the 32% in 2019. The Workforce Solutions new product pipeline is also rapidly expanding as our teams leveraged the power of our new Equifax Cloud infrastructure. We plan to rollout new products in mortgage Talent Solutions, Government and I-9 in the second half of the year. New product revenue will increase in 2021 and 2022 as we begin to reap the benefits of our new products introduced in the market by Workforce Solutions in the past 18 months.  Rudy and the Workforce Solutions team had multiple levers for growth in 2021, 2022 and beyond. Workforce is clearly our largest and most valuable business and we will continue to power our results in the future. Workforce Solutions growth rates and margins are highly accretive to Equifax, now and in the future. Slide 9 provides perspective on the tremendous growth Workforce has delivered since 2017 and the increasing impact of the business it has on Equifax with its highly accretive revenue growth rates and margins. In 2017, Workforce Solutions revenue and EBITDA made up 23% of Equifax revenue and 27% of business unit EBITDA.  For the first half of 2021, Workforce Solutions revenue and EBITDA have increased to 40% of Equifax revenue and over half of Equifax business unit EBITDA. In a short four years, Workforce Solutions has more than doubled in size and is now almost 50% in the first half versus the same period last year. It is up almost 50% in the first half versus same period last year. Our unique TWN employment and income assets and the continued expansion of employment-related assets within the Equifax Data Hub provides opportunities for both ongoing outsized growth in Equifax traditional financial markets of mortgage, banking, auto, as well as a substantial growth in new verticals in Government, Talent Solution and others to come.  We expect that Workforce Solutions will continue to be an increasingly large part of Equifax and power our top and bottom-line with the above-market growth in margins. Turning to Slide 10, this provides a perspective on the return to growth USIS delivered since 2018. USIS has delivered strong double-digit revenue growth over the past six quarters. Although the strong mortgage market has advantaged USIS as shown in the bottom left of the slide, USIS has driven consistent sequential improvement in non-mortgage growth since second quarter last year with the overall growth in USIS being driven by 18% non-mortgage growth in the first half of 2021.  The USIS team is also increasingly leveraging the Equifax Cloud to design and implement new NPIs for customers. The Equifax Cloud new products and our unique data assets are making USIS teams more competitive in the marketplace. And the USIS team is focused on integrating Kount into new Equifax Cloud and we are seeing increased used cases in opportunities with our ID and Fraud vertical from the Kount acquisition.  We expect ID and Fraud to play a large role in USIS growth in 2021 and beyond. I encourage you to review the ID and Fraud slides in our broader Investor Presentation, which can be found on our Investor Relations website following this call. Turning to Slide 11. This highlights the core growth performance in our mortgage for our U.S. B2B businesses, Workforce Solutions and USIS. Our U.S. B2B businesses delivered a combined 25% revenue growth in mortgage in the second quarter, which was 30 points stronger than the 5% mortgage decline we saw in overall mortgage market.  The strong outperformance was again primarily driven by Workforce Solutions with core mortgage growth of 57%. Consistent with past quarters, EWS\u2019 outperformance was driven by new records, increased market penetration, larger fulfillment rates and new products. Proof that lenders are increasingly becoming reliant on the unique TWN income and employment data when making credit decisions in the mortgage space. USIS delivered 4% core mortgage revenue growth in the second quarter, driven primarily by new debt monitoring solutions and further support from marketing. Our ability to substantially outgrow underlying markets is core to our business model and core to our future growth. I'll now turn the presentation over to John to discuss current trends in the mortgage market and to walk through our third quarter and revised full year 2021 guidance. John Gamble : Thanks, Mark. As Mark discussed, our Q2 results were very much stronger than we discussed with you in April, with revenue about $85 million higher than the midpoint of the expectation we shared. For perspective, all we used performed well relative to the expectations we shared. Performance in non-mortgage and our U.S. businesses, Workforce and USIS was very strong in absolute terms and relative to the expectations we shared. Our unemployment claims and employee retention credit businesses and Workforce Solutions declined in the quarter, but much less than expected.  International revenue performance was also very strong, again both in absolute terms and relative to our expectations. And although the mortgage market was down 5% versus our expectation of flat, our mortgage revenue principally in Workforce was not impacted to the same degree. This strong revenue drove the upside in adjusted EPS relative to the expectations we shared. Now, turning to mortgage, as shown on Slide 12, U.S. mortgage market credit increase declined 5% in 2Q 2021, weaker than the about flat we had included in our guidance. Our financial guidance for 2021 assumes that the trend in mortgage credit increase we saw in late June and July continues in 3Q 2021 resulting in a decline of mortgage market credit increase of about 23% in 3Q 2021 versus 3Q 2020.  Although our second half 2021 market credit inquiry assumptions are down significantly from the second half of 2020, they remain above the average as we saw prior to 2020. As shown in the left-side of Slide 13, mortgage market indicators remain above the peak seen in previous mortgage cycles.  Despite the substantial refinance activity that has occurred over the past year, the number of U.S. mortgages that could benefit from a refinancing remains at a relatively strong level of about $12 million. Refinance activity continues to benefit from low and recently declining mortgage rates and a substantial appreciation in home prices over the past year. Based upon our most recent data from January, mortgage refinancings continue to run just under $1 million per month. As shown on the right side of Slide 13, the pace of existing home purchases continues at historically very high levels. The strong new purchase market is expected to continue throughout 2021 and into 2022.  Slide 14 provides our guidance for 3Q 2021. We expect revenue in the range of $1.160 billion to $1.180 billion, reflecting revenue growth of about 9% to 11%, including a 1% benefit from FX. Acquisitions are positively impacting revenue by 1.8%. We're expecting adjusted EPS in 3Q 2021 to be $1.62 to $1.72 per share compared to 3Q 2020 adjusted EPS of $1.91 per share. In 3Q 2021, technology transformation costs are expected to be around $40 million or $0.25 a share.  Excluding these costs, which were excluded from 3Q 2020 adjusted EPS, 3Q 2021 adjusted EPS would be $1.87 to $1.97 per share. This performance is being delivered in the context of the U.S. mortgage market, which is expected to be down 23% versus 3Q 2020. Comparing the midpoint of our 3Q 2021guidance sequentially to our very strong 2Q 2021performance, revenue is down about $65 million. The drivers of this decline are two main factors. The largest factor is a decline in mortgage revenue, driven by the impact of the expectation we shared regarding the decline in the U.S. mortgage market.  The other significant factor is our expectation that we'll see a significant sequential decline in unemployment claims revenue. Our guidance for adjusted EPS declines about $0.30 per share sequentially. The bulk of this decline is driven by lower gross profit on the revenue expectation I just discussed. In addition, we are increasing investment sequentially in sales and marketing, particularly in the U.S. as well as increasing investment in products and technology.  Slide 15 provides the specifics on our 2021 full year guidance. We are increasing guidance substantially, reflecting our very strong 2Q 2021 performance. In the second half of 2021, we expect strong growth in our U.S. non-mortgage business and international and a return to growth in GCS.  We also expect our U.S. mortgage business to grow about 15% in 2021 over 20 points faster than the expected approximately 8% decline in the U.S. mortgage market. 2021 revenue of between $4.76 billion and $4.8 billion reflects revenue growth of about 15% to 16% versus 2020 including a 1.5% benefit from FX. Acquisitions are positively impacting revenue by 1.9%.  EWS is expected to deliver about 30% revenue growth with continued very strong growth in Verification Services. USIS revenue is expected to be up mid-to-high single-digits, driven by growth in non-mortgage. International revenue is expected to deliver constant currency growth of about 10% and GCS revenue is expected to be down mid-single-digits in 2021. 3Q 2021 revenue is also expected to be down mid single-digits, with 4Q 2021 revenue returning to growth. As a reminder, in 2021, Equifax is including all technology transformation costs and adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. These one-time costs were excluded from adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS in 2017 through 2020.  In 2021, Equifax expects to incur one-time cloud technology transformation costs of approximately a $155 million, a reduction of over 55% from the $358 million incurred in 2020. The inclusion in 2021 of this about $155 million in one-time costs would reduce adjusted EPS by about $0.97 per share.  This estimate of one-time technology transformation cost is up $10 million from a $145 million we guided in April. Given our very strong performance in 2021, we are investing to accelerate our tech transformation globally. 2021 adjusted EPS of $7.25 to $7.45 per share, which includes these tech transformation costs is up 4% to 7% from 2020. Excluding the impact of the tech transformation cost of $0.97 per share, adjusted EPS in 2021 will show growth of about 18% to 21% versus 2020. 2021 is also negatively impacted by the redundant system costs of $79 million related to 2020. These redundant system costs are expected to negatively impact adjusted EPS by about $0.49 per share and negatively impact adjusted EPS growth by about 7 percentage points. Additional assumptions included in 2021 guidance will be posted to the July Investor Relations presentation to be posted later today.  Slide 16 provides a view of Equifax total and core revenue growth that is included in our current guidance. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of movements in the mortgage market and Equifax revenue, as well as the impact of changes in our UC claims and Employee Retention Credit businesses within our Employer Services business. Employee Retention Credits are specific U.S. government incentives for companies to retain their employees in response to COVID-19 and the associated revenue is not expected to continue into 2022. The data shown for 3Q 2021 and full year 2021 reflects the midpoint of the guidance ranges we provided.  In 1Q 2021 and 2Q 2021, we delivered very strong core revenue growth of 20% and 29% respectively. We continued to deliver strong core revenue growth in 3Q 2021 of 17% and 19% for all of 2021 in our expectations. As Mark mentioned earlier, the composition of our core revenue growth is becoming more balanced, reflecting substantially increasing contributions from U.S. non-mortgage, International and as we enter 4Q 2021 GCS. And we continue to expect our mortgage business to grow at rates faster than the overall mortgage market. This very strong performance we believe positions us well entering 2022 and beyond. And now, I'd like to hand it back to Mark. Mark Begor : Thanks, John. Turning now to Slide 17, as I referenced earlier, pricing power in our technology teams continue to make very strong progress on our new Equifax Cloud Data and Technology Transformation, with the North American technology transformation expected to be principally complete in early 2022 and the remainder of North America transformation and customer migrations completing by the end of next year and our international transformations following North America being principally complete by the end of 2023.  Equifax's transformation to a cloud-native environment delivers a host of capabilities that only Equifax can provide as the only cloud-native data and technology company. The Equifax Cloud will deliver always on stability, accelerated response time and built-in industry-leading security. It will provide our customers with real-time access to data and insights that they can rely on to make decisions. The Equifax Cloud through our Ignite analytics platform will allow customers and Equifax data scientists to work together utilizing EFX unique data assets and customer proprietary assets to define attributes and models to improve customer outcomes.  And we will continue to accelerate the time from analytics to production to bring new products and solutions to market faster and more efficiently enhancing customer benefits and Equifax revenue. Already the Equifax Cloud has enabled us to produce new products designed and delivered on our Cloud infrastructure four times faster than the past. We began to leverage these cloud benefits in 2020, as we more effectively developed new products and delivered them to market leveraging the new EFX cloud, growing new product introductions by 44% last year - in 2020. These new improvements have been further accelerated in 2021 as we are delivering the highest number of new products in our history and we are realizing higher revenue from new product introductions. Slide 18 provides an update on NPIs, a key driver of our current and future revenue growth. As we just discussed, the new cloud transformation has significantly strengthened our NPI capabilities allowing us to increase both the number of NPIs and the revenue generated from new products. We continue to expand our product resources and focus on transforming Equifax into a product-led organization, leveraging our best-in-class Equifax cloud-native data and technology to fuel top-line growth.  As I discussed earlier, in the second quarter, we delivered 46 new products, which is up about almost 2x from the 24 we delivered last year. Year-to-date, we've rolled out 85 new products, which is up 44% from the 59 that we delivered in the first half last year. We are energized as we continue to grow off an NPI record-setting 2020.  We wanted to highlight some of these products rolled out during the quarter, which we expect to drive revenue growth over the second half and in the next few years. Our new payment Insights products launched by USIS in April was delivered in partnership with Urjanet and uses consumer permission utility in telco data to improve views of customers, consumers' financial picture and help credit invisibles.  The cloud-based solution promotes greater financial inclusion regardless of the consumers' traditional credit score by empowering consumers to show utility and telco payment history with banks or lenders when applying for loans or other services. The product also allows lenders to seamlessly integrate data into review processes while meeting industry-leading standards for protection of consumer data security, confidentiality and integrity. Workforce Solution launched a new mortgage 36 product in May. This solution addresses income verification needs by enabling mortgage lenders to pull an extended set of both active and inactive income and employment data for a more complex income mortgage applicants where additional history may be needed in the underwriting process.  EWS also launched a new talent report employment staffing product in April. This solution provides flexibility on the number of past employers pulled to meet the employment verification needs of the employer. Staffing agencies leverage VOE as a reference check was often looking to verify only to employers, which this product helps deliver. In the United Kingdom, we launched the Credit Vitality View app. This Ignite-based app visualizes key credit data trends across the UK versus a company's own performance. It uses a range of macroeconomic measures and includes filtering capabilities, so our customers can focus on the performance of their own portfolio and product lines such as mortgages or credit cards. The app also can illustrate these company and market trends over multiple years. Lastly, we introduced the Equifax Affordability Solutions in Australia, New Zealand. These solutions deliver automated, categorized income and expense verifications in a way that delivers meaningful and actionable insights for our customers. Our customers can easily digest and act on these insights through the delivery of comprehensive consumer affordability reports, which are now required from a regulatory standpoint in these markets. This new solution will reduce loan application processing timing cost, improve conversion rates and maximize efficiency, while fulfilling responsible lending regulatory requirements, delivering overall improvements to the consumer experience.  These are just some examples of the new solutions we launched during the quarter. We are focused on leveraging our new cloud capabilities to increase NPI rollouts and new product revenue in 2021 and beyond. Growing NPIs is central to our EFX2023 growth strategy. And as a reminder, our Vitality Index is defined as the percentage of revenue delivered by NPIs launched during the past three years. In April, we increased our Vitality Index outlook for 2021 from 7% to 8% and we remain confident in this framework for 2021. As you can see from the left of the slide, our 8% vitality outlook for 2021 is a big step forward from the 5% vitality we delivered last year. NPIs are a big priority for me and the team as we leverage the Equifax Cloud for innovation new products and growth. Slide 19 showcases the capabilities we've been building over the past three years that only Equifax can bring to the marketplace. We have unique market-leading differentiated data at scale that includes our 228 million ACRO credit records, 119 million TWN income and employment records and additional data at scale that comes from our alternative datasets including Kount and CTUE, PayNet, IXI and others. Our advanced analytics allow us to build and test attributes faster, leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning, and develop models in days and weeks where used to take months. Our team of 320 data scientists located around the world are leveraging our advanced analytics and Equifax Cloud-native infrastructure to define and deploy cloud-native products and solutions. And our cloud-native data fabric is allowing us to key EnLink our unique data asset in ways that we could never do before. Our data fabric stretches across the globe and we are in the early innings of leveraging its global capabilities. Only Equifax can provide these capabilities and we are on offense as we deploy these into the marketplace.  Wrapping up on Slide 20, Equifax delivered a record-setting second quarter. We have strong momentum as we move into the second half. Our 26% overall and 29% core revenue growth in the quarter reflects the strength and breadth of our business model and early benefits from our Equifax Cloud investments and of course, its enhanced focus on new products. We\u2019ve delivered six consecutive quarters of strong above-market double-digit growth. Our strong performance reflects the execution against our EFX2023 strategic priorities, Equifax's on offense. As we discussed earlier, we are confident in our outlook for 2021 and we raised our full year midpoint revenue guidance to $4.78 billion, increasing our 2021 growth rate by over 370 basis points to almost 16%. We also raised our midpoint EPS guidance to $7.35 increasing the growth rate by over 640 basis points. As we discussed earlier, Workforce Solutions had another outstanding quarter delivering 40% revenue growth and 58% EBITDA margins. EWS is our largest fastest growing and most valuable business. During the quarter, Workforce Solutions delivered 40% of Equifax revenue and we expect EWS to continue to drive Equifax's operating performance throughout 2021 and beyond as consumers recognize the value of our growing TWN database. Rudy and his team remain focused on driving outsized growth by focusing on their key growth drivers of adding new records, rolling out new products, driving penetration, driving their new Talent Solutions Data Hub, expansion into new verticals and leveraging their new EFX cloud capabilities.  USIS also delivered another strong quarter of 11% growth, driven by their 14% non-mortgage organic growth. We expect USIS non-mortgage growth to continue to be strong due to the economic recovery, the commercial focus of the team, new products and our unique alternative data assets. Sid and the USIS teams are competitive and winning in the marketplace and will continue to deliver in 2021 and beyond.  International grew for the third consecutive quarter, accelerating to 25% in local currency in the second quarter as economies reopen and business activity resumes. Our new international leader, Lisa Nelson has high expectations for her team and we expect continued strong growth through the rest of 2021. We are beginning to realize the benefits of our EFX Cloud Data and Technology transformation as we accelerate new product innovation with products designed and built off of our new EFX Cloud infrastructure. We\u2019ve spent the last three years building the Equifax Cloud and we're now starting to leverage our new cloud capabilities. As we move through the rest of the year and into 2022, we'll be increasingly realize the top-line, cost and cash benefits from these new cloud capabilities.  Accelerating new products, leveraging our differentiated data and the new EFX cloud capabilities is central to our EFX2023 growth strategy. We are beginning to see the benefits of our new product focus and resources leveraging the EFX cloud with the 85 NPIs completed in the first half, pacing well ahead of the record 134 we delivered last year. As we discussed in the past, bolt-on acquisitions that expand our differentiated data assets, strengthening Workforce Solutions and broadening our ID and fraud capabilities are integral to our future growth framework. We have reinvested our strong cash flow in five bolt-on acquisitions so far this year that will add 170 basis points to our revenue in the second half. We will continue to focus on accretive bolt-on acquisitions that strengthen Workforce Solutions. I am more energized now than when I joined Equifax three years ago what the future holds as we move from building the cloud to our next chapter of growth leveraging the new Equifax cloud for innovation, growth and new products. We have strong momentum across our business as we move into the second half and we are beginning to deliver on the benefits of the significant cloud data and technology investments we made over the past three years. Equifax's on offense and positioned to bring new and unique solutions for our customers that only Equifax can deliver leveraging our new EFX cloud capabilities. With that operator, let me open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from David Togut from Evercore. Your line is now live. David Togut : Thank you. Good morning. Good morning, Mark. Good morning, John. Good to see the strong growth and NPI continuing in the 13% new record growth. Clearly, the first half outperformance versus your guidance continue to come from the strength in Workforce Solutions. So, as we look at the second half guidance, what\u2019s embedded in terms of the outperformance of EWS core mortgage growth versus the mortgage market 62 percentage points in Q2. How are you thinking about the back half in terms of EWS core mortgage outperformance? Mark Begor : Yes. So, David, we don\u2019t give specifics by BU in terms of how we break down core. But as you can see from the detail we gave we are expecting to have very good core growth in the third quarter at 17%. We are expecting EWS with the continued performance extremely well and we are expecting them to continue to substantially outgrow the mortgage market.  And as we indicated for the full year, we expect our mortgage revenue to grow 15%, that\u2019s up from what we talked about in April and it\u2019s more than 20 points higher than the 8% decline that we are talking about for the overall mortgage market itself. So, we expect EWS to continue to substantially outperform and to continue to deliver very high core revenue growth. To give you data there is multiple levers by the Workforce Solutions team to drive that outperformance, it\u2019s specifically in mortgage and of course all the other verticals that the record additions help fuel that the new product roll outs that the team did last year and are continuing this year in the mortgage space will drive that.  We gave some visibility around our growth in the mortgage market itself. As you know, we don\u2019t see every mortgage. So the team is focused on adding income and employment from Equifax. The large portion of mortgage is we still don\u2019t see. And of course, we are continuing to drive the system-to-system integration.  So, all of those libraries that are what Rudy and his team are deploying to continue to drive that outperformance not only the mortgage market, but all of their markets. David Togut : Appreciate that. Just as a quick follow-up, looking at the 14% USIS organic non-mortgage growth in Q2, in which verticals are you gaining significant market share? And if you could maybe kind of compare where you are today in kind of non-mortgage USIS versus where you were a year ago? Mark Begor : Yes. I would say, first, we are certainly benefiting from the economic recovery. We\u2019ve seen that in card issuers and really all of the financial institutions are doing more marketing. You\u2019ve seen strong performance there in the consumers back in accessing credit products. So you\u2019ve seen that both in the mortgage side but I think you are focused more on the non-mortgage of course.  The new product rollouts are benefiting Sid and his team as they are focused on bringing new products to market. And really broadly, we\u2019ve got a strong focus as we\u2019ve been very clear over the last, really almost 24 months about the focus that the team has on building out their deal pipeline. They are focused on their customers.  We\u2019ve rebuilt and enhanced our commercial team with more coverage. We\u2019ve added more resources. We\u2019ve re-levered the commercial team. So, all of those are benefiting from us and we\u2019ve got a lot of confidence in our ability to be competitive in the non-mortgage market in USIS going forward. David Togut : Thanks very much. Appreciate all the insights. Operator : Thank you. The next question today is coming from Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse. [Operator Instructions] Kevin, your line is now live. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Thanks. I am going to ask one question, because I got a couple parts to it. But, hey Mark, you\u2019ve got EWS\u2019 40% of revenue today, 53% of EBITDA versus about 23% in 2017, somewhere around there. It feels to me like, what\u2019s happening with the TTI as you are accelerating the shift to EWS. So, can you help us understand kind of the dynamics of how the cloud transition impacts EWS versus the core business?  And then, within the context to that, if my math is right, the average client size was about 4000 contributors in terms of employees in 2018 versus about a 100 today. So, how do those dynamics kind of impact EWS?  What I am trying to get at is, it feels like, there is going to be structurally higher level of growth looking beyond the volatilities just mortgage overall. And again, it feels like that\u2019s something structural. So, just maybe trying to frame that to the extent you can help us. Mark Begor : Sure. And just broadly, as you know, we are focused on growing all of our businesses, all four business units. And clearly, Workforce Solution is very unique and really driven by the uniqueness of the income and employment data that it has at scale and the value of that. And we\u2019ve talked I think, Kevin, in the past that there was an element of catalyst from our perspective when the dataset got over 50% of non-farm payroll, call it a year ago.  And it just made the dataset more valuable. And when you think about someone\u2019s credit history, did they pay their bills is very valuable, but are they working and how much do they make is equally valuable. And really only Equifax has that dataset. The Workforce Solutions business has levers as we talked a couple of times on the call already they are really quite unique.  And I think it starts with records. Most data businesses have all the records. Workforce Solutions has shown a history of building out their dataset and as I talked in my comments, we added 14 million \u2013 rough 14 million records on a year-over-year basis. So we are continuing to add records. As you know, we got visibility for a significant addition or meaningful addition from a large payroll processor in the second half of the year.  And we are out there talking to individual companies to grow the dataset, which we do through our Employer Services business by providing those services. And then of course, the other payroll processors or that we don\u2019t have now with Equifax we are working to add. So records is a very important lever for that business and there is a long runway not only with non-farm payroll, where we are at 91 million unique versus 150 million or so total non-farm payroll. But we are focused on the Gig economy, which is another 40 million to 50 million individuals that have either first or second jobs or self-employed outside of the non-farm payroll and then of course pensioners. So, records are big opportunity for Workforce to grow.  And then you\u2019ve seen a lot of growth over the last couple of years beyond mortgage. Mortgage was always a place that this business is focused on and we\u2019ve been able to grow very, very strongly in the government vertical and of course you know, we got the large SSA contract that\u2019s going live in the second half and ramp to $40 million to $50 million of incremental revenue in 2022. So, that\u2019s an example of the dataset being used in another use case. And the other area that we\u2019ve been focused on outside of just kind of the core growth of the products and attrition, more usage and records is around strengthening the business through M&A. As you know, we\u2019ve done two acquisitions so far this year. HIREtech and i2Verify to strengthen our Employer Services business, which delivered records.  Of course, that\u2019s just a good core business. We talked about some of the solutions we have in the market like on anywhere they are growing outside of some of our traditional financial markets. So that focus on the hiring process where 75 million people are hired every year or change jobs and most of them have to have some kind of background screening done that relies on work history along with government data elements.  And today, we are building out the Equifax Data Hub, our Workforce Solutions Data Hub that includes our TWN data, but also other unique data elements and we\u2019d like to do more M&A in that space to strengthen Workforce Solutions as I mentioned in my comments that we are focused on building that out.  And just maybe closing on Workforce, the business has a long history of outperforming its underlying markets and I think if you look back a couple of years, you\u2019ve seen a step-up in that outperformance in the last couple of years that we link to the scale of the dataset. The cloud has allowed us to ingest more data more quickly.  Think about it two years ago, maybe three years ago, we had 27,000 contributors or companies contributing. Now we have a 1.2 million and there is different numbers about there and how many companies there are in the United States, 3 million, 4 million, 5 million. But we are really scaling that dataset quite substantially. So, it\u2019s a very unique business. It\u2019s one that we are investing in organically.  The cloud is allowing them to ingest more data and you\u2019ve seen a ramp up in new products coming out from Workforce Solutions as they start to leverage the new product capabilities and of course that\u2019s happening across Equifax. Operator : Thank you. The next question today is coming from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is now live. Manav Patnaik : Thank you. Mark, I apologize, just what you said on the Workforce M&A. Did you say that background screening was an area you are interested in or what was the comment? Mark Begor : No, no. No, I didn\u2019t say that. What I said was that, what\u2019s really interests us and when we talked about it before is, number one, strengthening the core Workforce Solutions. It\u2019s our strongest business. It\u2019s our largest business. It\u2019s our fastest growing business. And doing acquisitions like HIREtech and i2Verify is clearly a priority for Equifax.  The other area that we\u2019ve talked before with you and others about is the Talent Solutions Data Hub. We want to be in the data business around the hiring process. We are now, as you know, with our work history. We have an average of 4.5 jobs on the average American in our database and that work history is very valuable in the hiring process.  And beyond work history, as you know, other data elements like, where did you go to school. What licenses did you have. Have you ever been incarcerated before. Have you been arrested before. All those data elements are very, very valuable and we are building now our data hub of partnerships. If we could find a good way to M&A in that space, we\u2019d like to do it. Manav Patnaik : Okay. That makes sense. And just, John, I don\u2019t know if I missed it, but I was hoping you to help us just how to think about what you\u2019ve baked into your guidance, so just the growth in verification and employee services for the back half of the year? John Gamble : Yes. So, I think what we talked about is we gave a good view, I think what we expect the growth to be for the full year and as we indicated, we expect Workforce Solutions to grow over 30% in the year. So, obviously, that\u2019s up substantially from what we talked about in April. So, it reflects the much stronger performance in the second quarter but also continuing very strong performance in the third and fourth quarters. And we are expecting as I said, as we continue the strong performance across really all the businesses as we talked about I think effectively, we held or increased our expectation for growth in all of our businesses in the full year and therefore in the second half. So, we are feeling very good about the trend. Manav Patnaik : Alright. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Hamzah Mazari from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Mario Cortellacci : Hi, this is Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamzah. Just a quick question on your international business and I guess, specifically Australia. Could you just walk us through how margins in that business differ from other international markets? And then, if you could also just talk about your view on the recovery there? I think they did went into lockdown again. So, just want to get your outlook. Mark Begor : Yes. International still is broadly kind of lagging the United States, maybe Canada is quite similar as far as the vaccine rollouts. But other markets, I guess, UK is similar. But that\u2019s been choppier internationally than it has in the United States for sure and as you point out, Australia has got another lockdown, because the vaccines are really lagging there. The market has adjusted lot of international markets like it did in the United States quicker, meaning customers and consumers figure how to live their lives and operate their businesses in more of a virtual environment. And I think that\u2019s what we are seeing in Australia with \u2013 and our international markets that are still lagging in some regards, particularly in Latin America around the COVID lockdowns being relapsed. The margins, John, we are not growing dramatically different and on a global basis, I wouldn\u2019t characterize them differently by market. We really don\u2019t talk about on a market basis. John Gamble : Yes. We don\u2019t talk about them on a market basis, right. But what we\u2019ve indicated historically is, markets that look very much like the U.S., so we talk about Canada tends to run at higher margins than some other businesses. Australia looks probably more like international averages than you think about Canada that would be stronger. Mario Cortellacci : Understood. And then, just my follow-up, could you just comment on the Fraud segment of the business? And how much further scale can you gain there more through more M&A post the Kount deal. Obviously, it\u2019s a highly fragmented market there. And then, any initial views on synergies that you are seeing as you are integrating Kount? Mark Begor : Yes. I commented earlier that we are quite encouraged by that. We are really very energized and pleased with the acquisition in the team that we brought on board from Kount. ID and fraud is a very strategic growth area. It\u2019s also an area as you pointed out, if we could find more M&A, we\u2019d like to do it to broaden. It\u2019s a very big space and as you pointed out, it\u2019s very fragmented. We think we\u2019ve got very unique data assets to play in identity and fraud and kind of really augments that and that\u2019s really the power of the Kount combination and synergies with Equifax. It\u2019s really leveraging their data at scale from the ecommerce world. They have something like 32 billion interactions every year with consumers.  They have really scaled data assets around email addresses, IP addresses, cellphone numbers, over 400 million verified elements. And with ecommerce, you are interacting very quickly, because a lot of people are doing ecommerce. So the data is very current. And the combination of that data from Kount with Equifax is really the power.  And ID and fraud, we believe starts with data and that\u2019s why we think we have a license to play and if we could find more and we are looking for more M&A in the ID and Fraud space to further strengthen our position is a huge TAM that the market is, I think, close to $18 billion globally for ID and Fraud and it\u2019s growing at 20% with the large digital macro meaning more consumers interacting in really every aspect of their lives, whether it\u2019s financial services, insurance, telco, or of course, ecommerce and retail digitally.  And with that digital interaction, the requirement to verify that Mark is really Mark, it\u2019s critically important. And that\u2019s where the data assets come in. And also to do it seamlessly meaning where the consumer doesn\u2019t feel it. And the way to do that is to power it with more data. So, we are quite energized about the integration with Kount. The progress so far and it\u2019s an area we\u2019d like to be bigger in going forward both organically through the products and the synergies of the Kount acquisition, but also inorganically if we could find some M&A that would strengthen us. Mario Cortellacci : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from George Mihalos from Cowen. Your line is now live. Mark Begor : Hey, George. George Mihalos : Hey. Good morning, guys. Congrats on another strong quarter. Wanted to ask a broad question to kind of start things off, obviously, there is a lot of debate going on looking at the bond markets and alike. But, to the extent, we enter a more inflationary period going forward, is that\u2019s something that could be a catalyst for you guys both in terms of people relying more on credit and obviously, potentially the help of some of your FI customers in an environment where rates go up. I am just curious how you guys are thinking about that, if you are thinking about that at all? Mark Begor : Yes. We think about it and so, obviously, something that is hard to forecast. But when you think about interest rates going up, or inflation going up I think you got to step back and look at the consumer itself. The consumer coming out of COVID is very strong. But at the same time they are coming out of COVID with some pent-up demand. When we think that bodes well for the credit environment, meaning that the consumers are healthier, meaning they can access more credit and there is an underlying desire to going vacations, expand your home, buy new car, all those elements I think are a catalyst for the economy which we are already seeing and obviously quite strong.  And for the credit bureaus in Equifax, that means our customers are going to be spending more in marketing, spending more on originations and looking for new solutions to identify the consumers. If you think about our customers, they are very healthy. They really managed the pandemic much more strongly because their consumer was stronger.  Their losses were not anywhere near what were anticipated. So, our customers are strong and they are looking to grow. And if you got a consumer that\u2019s been paying down balances in lots of areas like cards and others during the pandemic because the stimulus and their broad financial strengths.  Our customers need to build up their balance sheets by getting more loans on their books, whether it\u2019s credit card or personal loan, an auto loan or a mortgage and of course, the other area that we watch is what impact higher interest rates may have in the future on the mortgage market. The one counter to that is there is still at least in current rates, a loan pipeline and John talked about it of consumers that will still benefit from a refi.  And then, the other element that we are watching is, home price appreciation is up dramatically. And that home price appreciation is an asset for consumers that historically they will access through either home equity loans or a refi of their mortgage to cash out refi. So that\u2019s another catalyst that there we keep an eye on. So, there is a lot of variables there which, - but when we think about our guidance for the second half, we got a lot of confidence in the underlying Equifax business, our ability to perform, which is why we raise guidance. George Mihalos : Okay. Great. Appreciate that color. Obviously, there are lot of puts and takes there. And then, John, just a housekeeping question and forgive me if you have answered this, I maybe missed it. But the margins in USIS, I think you called out several factors, some related to the inclusion of some of the tech expenses and then some additional sales and marketing as you would invest more in the segment. Is there a way to think about what the margins would have been in the year-over-year basis, apples-to-apples, so basically excluding what the contribution to expenses were from increased tech costs? John Gamble : Yes. I think, what we said is that, the biggest driver were the tech-related costs and the decline of about I think it was 380 basis points year-on-year. We\u2019ve also definitely invested more in marketing and sales given new NPI rollouts in the improving economy. And that\u2019s certainly impacted year-on-year and that would have been more impactful if you think about sequential. But we didn\u2019t give specifics. But we did indicate that the biggest driver of year-on-year decline is the tech-related cost. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Mark Begor : Hey, Andrew. Andrew Steinerman : Hi, it\u2019s Andrew. So, two questions. One, John, could you tell us the percentage of revenues in mortgage for just the second quarter just reported? And the second question is, I wanted to get back to a comment in Mark\u2019s prepared remarks about growth in Employer Services. I am pretty sure, Mark, that you said 20% growth this year outside of UC and ERC. Just again, correct me if I heard it right. And is that organic number and how much would we think that UC and ERC would change that number when thinking about ES growth for the whole year? Mark Begor : Andrew, mortgage was about 32% of revenue in the quarter. Andrew Steinerman : Thank you. Mark Begor : And on the Employer Services, we did say that we expect it to be up 20% for the year. And that\u2019s really driven by a lot of the new product roll outs that we have, the I-9 Anywhere solutions. We are just seeing real traction in the hiring process that\u2019s really driving that. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Simon Clinch from Atlantic Equities. Your line is now live. Simon Clinch : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up again with Verification Service in particular. I\u2019ve been quite excited by the step-up in growth rates for the non-mortgage portion in the second quarter. And this is before you\u2019ve got the Social Security Contract before you\u2019ve got the new record coming in. So, I was wondering if you help me understand or give me some color around how to think about that pace of growth as we move through the next year or two, because I am struggling to work a wide or such a big step-up in the fourth quarter. Mark Begor : Yes. There is an element of COVID recovery in there in some of the markets like cards and in auto and P loans, so that there is an element to that. Records are a piece of it for sure. As you add records, our hit rates go up. So that\u2019s clearly an element. Our real focus on new products in that space and as you point out, SSA contract that will go live in the second half will really ramp in \u2013 somewhat in the second half of the year. But it\u2019s really a 2022 benefit as it gets to full \u2013 the full runrate. There is just a lot of opportunities for us in the non-mortgage space. In Talent Solutions, we talked about a very strong growth there. And then, some of the other non-mortgage financial verticals are performing well. John Gamble : Yes. Mark mentioned huge growth in Talent Solutions and government, which are the two biggest segments by far in Verification Services. Simon Clinch : Okay. Understood. Thank you. And just a follow-up. I was wondering just more broadly, with some of the fin-tech startups growing in the market today, that are effectively using multiple or alternative datasets just like you are, yourselves. But it\u2019 also using the credit reports in data as well to sort of improve models for risk assessments and decision-making in the credit process. As that where you have gone today, but it\u2019s not kind of market opportunity grows. You become \u2013 I am assuming you become more competitive along with. And I was wondering if you could talk about that that\u2019s the longer term competitive dynamic and how you are planning to navigate that? Mark Begor : Yes. I wouldn\u2019t think about them as competitors. They are customers and partners. The bulk of the data they use in their processes comes from us or our competitors. They have some of their own data from historical interactions with consumers. But whether that\u2019s going to be broad data to verify, their consumers who they say they are in a BNPL transaction or a lot of the fin-techs are in P loans and sub-prime auto and mortgage and of course in cards, they are using our credit file.  They are using our MC Plus data. We sell quite a bit of in fin-tech of our TWN income and employment data that\u2019s used in some of the larger ticket transactions there. So, they are very data savvy. Very data sophisticated and as you point out, they look for more data to enhance the crediting decision, which plays well for us, because as we continue to build out our differentiated datasets, we can bring real value in enhancing the credit decision or the decision they are making with the addition of more data.  So, we view it as a positive. I think as you know, we weren\u2019t focused on fin-tech three, four years ago. We changed that and really expanded our resources and capabilities there and we think our cloud investment plays well for fin-tech. Our differentiated data plays well for fin-tech. And our new product focus plays well for fin-tech. So it\u2019s a place we want to be larger in. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Andrew Nicholas from William Blair. Your line is now live. Nicholas, please go ahead sir. Andrew Nicholas : Thank you for taking my question. My first one, I wanted to ask another one on international. You mentioned in your prepared remarks and it\u2019s noted on a few of the slides that you are outgrowing underlying markets. So, I was wondering if there is any region in particular, or countries in particular where your share gains are outsized internationally? And then, to the extent that\u2019s the case, what is specifically driving your gains in those markets? Mark Begor : Yes. Our \u2013 all the markets really were quite strong in the second quarter with every region really up over 20%. So, with broad base, there is definitely an element that\u2019s meaningful in the quarter from the COVID recovery. I think all the international markets after a year of COVID it really figured out how to operate. Because they all have a different flavor of COVID challenges and they are still operating with \u2013 like the Australia lockdown or UK opened up on Monday.  But there is still some hesitancy, I think for some consumers to go out. But they don\u2019t have operates. I think that\u2019s a big driver. I wouldn\u2019t really highlight any market differently than the other. We have a very strong market position in Australia.  In Canada, we have a very strong market position. We do it in Latin America in a lot of the markets that we operate in. I think broadly, our international markets are very NPI focused. They always have been by really leveraging new products created in the United States or unique to their markets and in getting those out. Those are a big fuel for growth going forward.  And in a lot of our markets, we are continuing to grow our data assets. You\u2019ve heard, I think, one or two of the new products I highlighted are our new solutions in our international markets. Andrew Nicholas : Got it. Thank you. And then, for my follow-up, I know it\u2019s been touched on a few times already, but to flush out Talent Solutions a little bit further, I think you said 200% plus growth there. Is there any additional color you could give on specific products that are contributing? And maybe more importantly, from my perspective, how should I think about how much of that strength is tied to better hiring volumes to the extent that it is, particularly relative to the second quarter of last year? Thank you. Mark Begor : Yes. So, there has been a really substantial focus on new products in Talent Solutions and they are generally built around for allowing the party that\u2019s purchasing the product, right. Whether it be a background screen or somebody else, to buy specifically the information they need for the duration they require it. And we\u2019ve launched a series of products that allow them to do that in ways and they tend to be at very attractive price points for Equifax. So, - so, we are seeing very good improvement in NPI in Talent Solutions. Really it\u2019s a real strength for EWS. But obviously, we\u2019ve also seen very substantial increase in hiring as we get into the second quarter relative to last year. So, I think it gives you a break down. But what I can say is and I think we\u2019ve been talking about this consistently since at least the third quarter that new products have driven a substantial amount of growth in Talent Solutions really starting about midway through last year. Operator : Thanks. Our next question today is coming from Kyle Peterson from Needham. Your line is now live. Kyle Peterson : Hey. Good morning. Thanks guys for taking the questions. Just want to start on EWS picked any Employer Services. It looks like the momentum has been really stronger on the Talent side. How should we think about some of the puts and takes in that business as things open up between growth on that side of the business versus like some of the excess UC claims kind of declining as long as things keep improving? Mark Begor : Yes. We\u2019ve been very clear that we expect UC claims to decline from their extraordinary levels of a year ago and that\u2019s a part of our guidance and when you think about some of the other solutions we have, the hiring process is generally good news for a lot of those. Whether it\u2019s I-9s onboarding an employee. The employer resource credit is one that\u2019s really still a COVID benefit that we expect to benefit through the rest of the year. But that\u2019s an area that we are focused on expanding and as you know, we did two acquisitions, particularly HIREtech that we acquired in the first quarter is helping us get stronger and work opportunity tax credits, which is a space that we\u2019ve been growing going forward. John Gamble : Yes. The only thing the Employer Services excluding UC and ERC, right, which is what we exclude from core growth. The two biggest businesses there are I-9 and our business that supports ACA and our I-9 business as we talk to is growing very fast, right. And that\u2019s new solutions and new \u2013 using our new commerce platform to get the much smaller customers. So they can access us more quickly and directly and then also obviously with the changes in what\u2019s occurring in the ACA we are seeing that return to growth. So, I think those two factors are been very beneficial in the growth of the businesses excluding obviously UC and ERC, which Mark already talked about. Kyle Peterson : It\u2019s super helpful. And then, maybe just a follow-up. You guys have mentioned the large payroll partnership that\u2019s planned going live later in the year. Maybe if you could give us any color on potential size and the rate of monetization once that goes live and how that could influence the back half of the year? Mark Begor : Yes. I don\u2019t think we want to get into the exact size on it. But we\u2019ve been trying to be clear, it was one of the top payroll processors and we are pleased to be adding them to the TWN database and we factor this into our framework or guidance for the second half. And obviously, if it\u2019s added, it will benefit us in 2022, benefit Workforce Solutions as those records are added. Those turn into revenue in our system integrations. Kyle Peterson : Thanks guys. Operator : Thanks. Our next question is coming from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Toni Kaplan : Thanks very much and good morning. You mentioned the final pay leader in a recent question and that\u2019s seeing a lot of growth right now. Can you just talk about your position in that market? Any sort of current revenue contributions and growth rates you are seeing there? And how you view the opportunity little bit more generally like in terms of future potential for that market? Mark Begor : Yes. We are participating in the BNPL space in the states and other markets around the globe where Australia and UK and Canada I think our markets also have \u2013 we have the BNPL relationships. We provide identity to them after verify who the consumer is and some of the BNPL players are starting to move to larger ticket transactions and looking to do more of an underwriting of the consumer. If you are doing a BNPL on a $100 pair of blue jeans, there is a risk profile that you can do less underwriting, if you will. Maybe just verify the identity of the consumer to make sure it\u2019s not a fraudster when you start doing a refrigerator or a couch or a larger ticket transaction. So, in all of our BNPL discussions we are talking to them about their desire to move into bigger ticket transactions and leveraging Equifax data to do that including the credit trial, some of our alternative data like NC Plus or incremental employment data from Workforce Solutions. Toni Kaplan : Great. And then, for my follow-up, consumer indirect has got slightly better in the quarter. But it\u2019s still down. I know you said you expected it to return to growth in 4Q. But we did see that one of your clients \u2013 one of the larger players in the space reported a very strong quarter. Just wondering is there just sort of a lag to get to \u2013 basically to get to you? Or I guess, why isn\u2019t that better yet? Mark Begor : Yes. I don\u2019t know which competitor you are referring to. But as you might imagine, we all don\u2019t have the same customer relationships and there is a different level of COVID recovery I think with that space. And when you think about lead gen players, if you are a bank, you are going to restart your own lead gen first before you start buying third-party leads from a lead gen player. So, I think there is some lag in that that we expect improve as we go through the second half. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Andrew Jeffrey from Truist. Your line is now live. Andrew Jeffrey : Hi. Good morning. Lots of terrific information here. Appreciate it. Mark, I am wondering if you can talk a little bit about within EWS verifier in particular. The volume which I assume is being driven nicely by NPI, as well as the TWN database but also price and I am thinking about price to value around some of your newer solutions but also the impact of more digital verifications in mortgage for example. Is there a dynamic you can call out sort of between price and unit, so we can think about yield in that business? Mark Begor : Yes. We don\u2019t talk about specific price, but we try to exercise price in all of our businesses. So, as you might imagine, through our uniqueness of the solution or the dataset and of course Workforce Solutions is for sure our most differentiated data asset. So, we do use price, but product is also a very strong way to enhance revenues.  We talked in the past about historically, we have a single whole solution that we might sell for $15, $20, $25, $30 of Workforce Solutions and some of the newer products we\u2019ve rolled out in the last 12 to 18 months deliver more value to our customers whether it\u2019s more historical data at a $150 price point or it\u2019s allowing a co-borrower solution called, we call it Mortgage Duo where you can pull a husband and wife that are both applying for a mortgage in a single pool, that\u2019s priced at more of the $150 solution.  Multiple pool alternatives in order to incent the usage out of those, you can decide, define it whether you want to call it price or product, but it all results in higher revenue and higher margins. And that\u2019s definitely influence the strategy is to leverage the new cloud capabilities around the use of our data in Workforce Solutions to bring new solutions to market.  And then as you referenced earlier, records are obviously result in higher hit rates. Remember, we are getting in system-to-system integrations. We get a hit on our database on every customer where we consumer that our customer has and now we are in that kind of 60% hit range on the non-farm payroll as we add records and go to 61%, 62%, 63%, that drives revenue of course.  And the systems \u2013 system integrations that we have, which are growing, we are now at 75% at mortgage, continuing to grow that. We only see 60% of mortgages meaning there is a lot of customers out there that we still have to add to our relationships. So that\u2019s another growth lever.  So there is just a lot of place here in growing that business which is why I said the outsized growth is you\u2019ve seen for really a decade that the stronger growth in the last couple of years from the scale of the dataset where it just becomes more valuable to integrate into our customers\u2019 workflows because of the higher hit rates that it delivers. Andrew Jeffrey : Thank you. I appreciate that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners. Your line is now live. Craig Huber : Yes, good morning. My first question on Fraud and ID, can you potentially size that for us in the U.S.? I am just \u2013 I know it\u2019s across multiple products you have there and then just, what the growth rate is if you could break that out for us please? John Gamble : Yes. I think we\u2019ve talked about this in the past, right that as we look at 2021, we are expecting to see our total Fraud and IT business, even that\u2019s when I break out the U.S. separately to be over $200 million. so, that includes the addition of Kount. But in total, we are expecting our Fraud and ID business to exceed $200 million in 2021. Mark Begor : And that\u2019s a space as you know we want to grow. That\u2019s why we did the Kount acquisition and we are still in the early days of that integration and really driving the synergies and combining the data assets and rolling out the new solutions that the combination of Equifax data and Kount data is going to deliver principally in the U.S. but Kount also got global capabilities. so, it will benefit us at some of our global markets too. Craig Huber : And what sort of revenue growth and what would that imply for the full year? And then my follow-up question if I could ask please? In USIS, can you just hit on a little bit on autos, credit card, personal loans in your core credit card \u2013 credit bureau business? How well that did in the last quarter and what\u2019s your sort of outlook more importantly for the second half of the year? Thank you. Mark Begor : Yes, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve given in Identity and Fraud a growth rate. But I think we have shared broadly and you know this \u2013 the market itself is growing 20%. So, that\u2019s underlying why we invested in Kount and why we are still very open in looking \u2013 it\u2019s a priority of us to do more M&A because the size of the TAM is $18 billion growing at 20%. The digital macro of more consumers doing things online on their phone, on their tablets, on their computers is really driving us which is why we want to be bigger in it.  As far as in USIS, auto has been impacted by some of the inventory issues. So that\u2019s clearly dampened some of their growth. We\u2019ve seen strong growth in card as marketing and broadly originations, if we come back and same with P loans. John Gamble : And as Mark mentioned in his comments, right, FI grew over 20% and auto grew double-digits \u2013 so, in the quarter. Operator : Thanks. And our next question is coming from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. George Tong : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Two questions. Within your non-mortgage USIS business, how does revenue in 2Q 2021 approximately compare with 2Q 2019 levels? And then secondly, how is your non-mortgage USIS business performing relative to the broader industry from a growth perspective? John Gamble : Hey, George, go with the first question, I am sorry. Mark Begor : How did we compare to \u2013 how does our second quarter in USIS compare to 2019? John Gamble : Yes. So, we haven\u2019t given the specific detail. But what we have indicated is we are seeing growth relative to 2019 really across most of the businesses, right? Mark Begor : And then, second one is versus the \u2013 I think your second question, George, is versus the industry, which I assume needs versus our competitors. One of our competitors hasn\u2019t reported yet and I think versus the other that did, I think we are in line and quite pleased with our performance in competitiveness in the marketplace and we are seeing that with the kind of core growth that we are delivering in non-mortgage. George Tong : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jeff Meuler from Baird. Your line is now live. Jeff Meuler : Yes. Thank you. For Employment and Income Verification, do you have a sense of how often the cost are borne out of the profit pool of the originator versus pass-through because the consumer and their closing costs. And on the 60% metric that you gave us, any sense if you over or under index to the purchase first refi market relative to broader enquiries, specific on the verification services? Mark Begor : Yes. And I think you are talking about mortgage, Jeff. In mortgage, you know, the credit file that was used in virtually a 100% in mortgage and that\u2019s a pass-through clause for the consumer. We are starting to have some originators move the income and employment data as a closing statement in I guess, early days on that and we think that\u2019s an opportunity going forward it\u2019s going to take some time. John Gamble : Yes. In terms of whether our penetrates is different in refi versus purchase, we don\u2019t think so. We think it\u2019s relatively consistent. It\u2019s basically driven more by the underwriter or the provider of the mortgage than it is by the refi versus new purchase. Jeff Meuler : Got it. John Gamble : I think, Jeff, you know the difference in number of polls on the credit side versus the income and employment, we\u2019ve been closing that gap on income and employment with there is an average of four to five credit polls for a mortgage and now we were in kind of the two plus range on income and employment data which is up from a number of years ago or closer to one and that\u2019s when we want to continue to grow and we think there is opportunity there. Jeff Meuler : Yes. I hear you. And then on Slide 11, the mortgage outgrowth within verify relative to end-market inquiries, where do you expect it to level off in coming years? And maybe at least you\u2019d say, do you expect it to be higher than this kind of 11% to 21% range it was in pre-2020 because of all of the structural growth drivers you are talking about? John Gamble : Well, I don\u2019t think we want to get into guidance that level given it\u2019s outside of 2021. If you think about the opportunities we\u2019ve laid out and what the cloud benefits are, we believe there is a lot of opportunity for Workforce Solutions broadly and in mortgage. When you are adding records, obviously it allows you to grow the market whether it\u2019s up, down or sideways. So, and that\u2019s a big focus for us and we start a lot of runway on records and the scale of the dataset, more system to system integrations, we get a 25% lift in polls in our system to system integration versus coming to our website. The number of polls, closing that gap with the 4 to 5 on the credit file. New products is another way to continue to outgrowth the market which we are focused on pure price. Obviously, it allows you to outperform the market. So, we are confident in the scale of the levers there, but I don\u2019t think we want to give any guidance on what it\u2019s going to look like over the long-term. Jeff Meuler : But those levers are increasing relative to prior periods, correct? That\u2019s the right interpretation? John Gamble : 100%. Jeff Meuler : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ashish Sabadra from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick \u2013 wondering if you can provide a quick update on your FICO partnership and the data decisions cloud. Have you seen better traction there, particularly as consumer marketing and consumer lending picks up? Thanks. Mark Begor : Yes. It\u2019s an important relationship for us. I do a quarterly review with Will Lansing the CEO of FICO and myself and the team. We \u2013 actually, it\u2019s not quarterly, it\u2019s monthly. So we are excited about that and decide the data decisions cloud which is the integration of their solution with Ignite. We are also in market with a joint solution on AMLKYC that we are very pleased with and we are looking for other solutions going forward. So, we are pleased with the progress. We are in the market commercially and looking to benefit both of what makes sense and of course we go to market independently where it makes sense to. Ashish Sabadra : Actually helpful color. That\u2019s great. And then, maybe just a quick question on any update on the regulatory front? Again, I know you\u2019ve spoken about this in the past. But just there was a financial services committee hearing in June. And then, there were certainly things around regulators are talking about the changing the CRA.  I was just wondering if you can talk about how that can potentially, any impact to the business, but also how we think about increased demand for alternate data as there is more focus on non-bank and under bank customer? Thanks. Mark Begor : Yes. I think there is a couple of net questioning. I think maybe the first one you are focused on is that some discussions around a public credit bureau. We don\u2019t think there is a lot of traction on that. There never was and we don\u2019t think that there is a real path to that. It doesn\u2019t make sense. There is three large credit bureaus. There is another 30 CRAs underneath the three large credit bureaus. So I think there is plenty of competition in investments to support consumers. The second half of your question around real desire in Washington and with \u2013 we\u2019ve heard the CFPB talk about it around access to credit for those that are challenged in getting to credit and really drive around alternative data. That\u2019s clearly a big focus of ours.  You\u2019ve heard us talk about it on this call and others around expanding our alternative data, using the Equifax cloud to combine our differentiated data assets and really open up credit using things like utility bills, payment records, cellphone payment records, income and employment data to expand access to the credit. It\u2019s clearly a focus of ours and it is of our customers, the financial institutions and banks and that is aligned with the push that Washington has. Ashish Sabadra : That\u2019s very helpful. Congrats again on the solid results. Operator : Thank you. The next question today is coming from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Your line is now live. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Maybe John, maybe you could help me out there is just a little bit of just sequentially on the Online Information Services, it was down about $4 million despite the fact that we are getting more opening up a little bit of Kount in there. Is the whole difference will be the impact of mortgage just the decline sequentially in mortgage applications and how that hit or is there anything else I should be thinking about there? John Gamble : No. I mean, as we talked about the fact that we saw very good organic and total growth obviously, which includes the acquisitions in our non-mortgage business. Actually, non-mortgage growth was a little bit stronger. And so, obviously because of the acquisitions in online and so what you are seeing obviously is the negative impact on mortgage \u2013 from the decline in mortgage and that would be the negative impact that you are seeing in OIS. So I don\u2019t think there is anything more complicated in that. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. Great. And then, just as a follow-up, I am not sure if there is a qualitative way to ask this, but maybe quantitatively, particularly in international and maybe some of the other locations very strong growth. But there has been generally a very good difference in terms of the reopening. And is there any way for you or how do you view this internally in terms of how much are you getting from Equifax really returning to being on offense with all the efforts you\u2019ve made versus just, hey the markets are opening up. Is there some way for us to think about that? Mark Begor : Yes. It\u2019s challenging. I would say, we are still cautious in the second half around some of those recoveries and even in the United States the delta concerns is that getting impact things is something obviously we watch. I think the thing that John and I keep an eye on is kind of deal pipelines. Where are winning in the marketplace. Where are we adding new customers. Where are we rolling out new products. Those are kind of the above market kind of growth that we are pleased with the momentum. We talked a bunch about the USIS and Workforce, but also what the teams are doing internationally on that front. John Gamble : And we are accelerating NPI. As Mark talked about in his comments, the new product rollouts really, as you know, we are doing as to bring new solutions to our customers, but we are also doing it to grow our top-line and new product rollouts generate revenue as they come into market in a very positive way. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Caroline Conway from AllianceBernstein. Your line is now live. Caroline Conway : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. So, I wanted to ask about the spread of new product introductions between USIS and EWS at the stage and specifically when we might expect to see USIS revenue contribution from NPIs that are on par with EWS? And then, my second separate question is on capital allocation. I just noted that there is a few decisions that are being made based on the business outperformance to accelerate the tech transition. There seems to be a hint that share repurchases could exceed $100 million. So just wanted to get an update on the prioritization of different capital allocation choices as we see that excess strength? Mark Begor : Sure. On your first question about NPIs, all our teams \u2013 all four business units are intently focused on NPIs. It\u2019s a priority that\u2019s really central to our EFX2023 strategy. So, I don\u2019t think there is real difference of activity that the pipelines that John and I have a monthly review with the teams on \u2013 with the product teams around how they are working to leverage our new client capabilities to bring new solutions to market and they all have very robust pipelines and we are seeing revenues. I don\u2019t think \u2013 we don\u2019t disclose the vitality index by business unit. But it\u2019s a broad based as far as everyone\u2019s focus.  As far as capital allocation, we are clearly committed to completing the cloud. We are obviously spending the dollars there and we\u2019ve been quite consistent. Those dollars are coming down as we go through and into 2022. But we are quite significant to last three years and we are starting to really pivot \u2013 leveraging the cloud and getting the benefits from the cloud, which are quite meaningful.  And there was no intended hints around changing our stock buyback. So, I don\u2019t know you picked that up in the comments. But that wasn\u2019t an intent. We are quite clear in launching a buyback earlier this year to offset solution from employee plans that that was a step forward, but nothing more than that.  The third leg on capital allocation that you didn\u2019t mention is M&A and we try to be very clear that we see meaningful opportunities to enhance Equifax through M&A whether it\u2019s in differentiated data solutions which Kount check that box, Identity and Fraud, if that\u2019s growing space that we want to be bigger in and we think we\u2019ve got to check at the play there because of our data.  Kount that check that one. Second is or third really is, strengthening our Workforce Solutions. It\u2019s our fastest and strongest \u2013 fastest growing and strongest business and strengthening the core Workforce through HIREtech and i2Verify is key to our strategy and as we mentioned earlier, we are really focused on widening Workforce Solutions really in the Talent Solution space through data assets. Data that would be additive to our income and employment work history that we have in the database.  And then, I mentioned earlier differentiated data assets, we are always looking for unique data assets that we can combine to existing Equifax data assets. So, M&A is a priority of ours and as we mentioned earlier, we\u2019ve done five transactions this year, Kount being quite significant. But we are on the lookout for acquisitions. What I would characterize as bolt-ons that I will really check those three areas of differentiated data, identity and fraud and strengthening and broadening Workforce Solutions. Caroline Conway : That makes sense and thank you for the clarification. Mark Begor : Sure. Operator : Thanks. Our next question today is coming from Gary Bisbee from Bank of America Securities. Your line is now live. Gary Bisbee : Yes. Thanks. Thanks for the patience and staying this long. Just one quick clarification question if I could. Mark, you commented when talking about employer about the employee retention credits which I see in your Slide 23, I think it was you lumped in with the unemployment. And so, did I hear right that effectively those are credits that you are getting that you think will end at the end of this year? And is it right to think that that sort of pushes off a little bit when you\u2019ll face the real severe declines from unemployment normalizing? Or is it \u2013 was there something else this quarter that allowed the combination of that in the unemployment claims to do exceptionally well relative to the brutally tough comp you had? Thank you. Mark Begor : Yes. It\u2019s actually this quarter, but ERC was a little stronger than we thought obviously with the new credits. So difficult to forecast. And you see it was a little stronger than we thought, right? So, the unemployment claims filings were a little higher than we expected when we gave guidance initially. And you have to \u2013 as you move through the rest of this year, ERC does tend to offset a little bit via declining UC. But as we said, the ERC credits will be something that we\u2019ll only see this year and it will be gone as we get into next year. Gary Bisbee : Alright. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ve reached the end of our question and answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to Dorian for any further or closing comments. Dorian Hare : Thank you for joining today. Mark, John and I look forward to engaging with you in individual meetings and in conferences and other forums throughout the summer. This conclude today\u2019s call. Operator Thank you. We\u2019ve reached the end of our call. Thank you. You may disconnect and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

It is now my pleasure to introduce Dorian Hare, Senior Vice President and Head of Corporate Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Dorian Hare : Thanks, and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Dorian Hare. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the IR Calendar section of the News & Events tab on our IR website, www.investor.equifax.com. During the call today, we will be making reference to certain materials that can be also found in the Presentations section of the News & Events tab at our IR website. These materials are labeled Q3 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Also, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including fourth quarter and full year 2021 guidance as well as a framework for 2022, to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to material -- to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors that may impact our business are set forth in our filings with the SEC, including our 2020 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. Also, we'll be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and also posted on our website. Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark. Mark Begor : Thanks, Dorian, and good morning. We had a very strong third quarter and first 9 months of 2021, a continuation of our strong outperformance last year with record revenue in the quarter of $1.223 billion, which was up over 14%, with core non-mortgage market and non-UC, ERC claims revenue growth of 20%. We are executing extremely well against the critical priorities of our EFX2023 strategy, as we highlighted on Slide 4. Our focus on leveraging the new Equifax cloud for innovation, new products and growth is clearly driving our strong financial results. Our revenue growth has accelerated from 3% in 2019, as we were recovering from the 2017 cyber event and investing heavily in our EFX Cloud transformation to 17% last year. We are on track to deliver 19% core growth this year at the midpoint of our revised 2021 guidance. More importantly, our core growth, which excludes the impact of the mortgage market, unemployment claims and ERC-related revenues is expected to accelerate to 21% this year, a powerful figure that reflects the strength of our underlying business model and EFX2023 growth strategy. Not only is our core growth accelerating above historical levels during '20 and '21 in challenging COVID markets. And more recently, in a declining mortgage market, we are also expanding EFX beyond our traditional credit bureau routes to a more diverse data analytics and technology company with our investments in the Equifax cloud, new data assets and NPIs, along with reinvesting our outperformance in bolt-on M&A in areas such as talent, government and ID and fraud. We are quickly pivoting from building the Equifax cloud to leveraging it for innovation of new products that will position the new Equifax for stronger and more diversified growth in the future. Our EFX2023 growth strategy remains our compass for the future and drives all of our top and bottom line growth initiatives as we move towards '22 and beyond. Turning to Slide 5. Equifax had a very strong quarter. Revenue at $1.22 billion was up 14.5%, with organic constant currency growth up a strong 12%. The almost 15% top line growth was off a strong 19% growth last year in a much stronger mortgage market. This was our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. More importantly, our core growth was up a strong 20%. Our U.S. B2B businesses of Workforce Solutions and USIS, which together represent almost 75% of Equifax revenue, again drove our growth, delivering 17% revenue growth despite the 21% decline in the U.S. mortgage market in the quarter. Non-mortgage revenue was up over 30%, and organic non-mortgage revenue was up 24%, strengthening sequentially from the 16% and 20% we saw in the first 2 quarters of the year. Third quarter Equifax adjusted EBITDA totaled $404 million, up slightly from third quarter last year with margins of 33%. As expected, margins were down versus 2020 due to the inclusion of cloud technology transformation costs of $45 million in our adjusted results in the quarter, which were excluded last year, and redundant cloud transformation systems cost of $15 million. These costs related to cloud tech transformation negatively impacted EBITDA margins by almost 500 basis points. Adjusted EPS of $1.85 a share was down slightly from last year. Adjusting for the cloud transformation costs of $45 million or $0.27 a share, adjusted EPS would have been up a strong 11%. We continue to make significant progress executing the EFX Cloud data and technology transformation. In the quarter, we completed 4,000 B2B customer migrations for a total of 15,400 migrations completed so far this year. In September alone, USIS completed over 900 customer migrations. Since the beginning of the transformation, we've completed almost 97,000 B2B migrations, 3.5 million consumer migrations and 1 million data contributor migrations. We remain on track and confident in our plan. We continue to expect the North American transformation to be principally complete in early '22, with the remaining customer migrations broadly completing by the end of next year. International transformation will follow, being principally completed by the end of 2023, with some customer migrations continuing into 2024.  We're still in the early days of leveraging the cloud but remain confident that will differentiate us commercially, expand our NPI capabilities, accelerate our top line and expand our margins and the growth in cost savings in '22 and beyond. Our NPI performance also continues to accelerate. In the quarter, we released 30 new products. And we still expect our Vitality Index to accelerate from 5% last year to over 8% in 2021. Given our very strong third quarter performance, we are increasing our full year revenue guidance by approximately 320 basis points or $131 million at the midpoint of a range between $4.9 billion to $4.921 billion, up 19% from last year, and increasing our full year adjusted EPS guidance by $0.22 per share to a midpoint of $7.57 per share, which adjusting for technology transformation cost implies a 23% growth in EPS. This includes our expectation that the U.S. mortgage market as measured by credit inquiries will decline just over 7% this year with the bulk of the return to normalization in the second half, which we expect to be down around 20%. Roughly 2/3 of the 320 basis point increase in our revenue growth framework to 19% is from organic business performance, with the balance from the acquisition of Appriss, Health e(fx) and Teletrack, which we expect to add about $45 million to revenue in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, Equifax core revenue growth, the green sections of the bars on Slide 6, grew a very strong 20%, a third consecutive quarter of core growth at or above 20%. Non-mortgage growth in EWS and USIS and growth in International drove about 900 basis points to the core revenue growth, excluding acquisitions and FX, with mortgage outperformance primarily in Workforce Solutions driving about 800 basis points of organic core growth in the quarter. As we move through '22 and '23, we expect to continue to see strong and balanced core growth, reflecting the benefits of the new EFX Cloud, accelerated NPIs, continued strong non-mortgage growth, both from organic growth and acquisitions, as well as continued strong outperformance from Workforce Solutions. Turning to Slide 7. Workforce Solutions had another exceptional quarter, delivering revenue of $508 million, which was up 35%. This is the first quarter Workforce Solutions has delivered over $0.5 billion of revenue in a single quarter, a big milestone. This was against a very strong 57% growth last year. Adjusted EBITDA margins were up over -- were 54%. Non-mortgage revenue at Workforce Solutions was up over 48%, with organic non-mortgage revenue up 41%. The strength of Workforce Solutions and uniqueness of their TWN income and employment data set was clear again in the third quarter. Workforce's Verification Services revenue of $403 million was up a strong 34%. Verification Services mortgage revenue grew 22% in the quarter despite the 21% decline in the mortgage market, with the EWS outperformance driven by increased records, penetration and new products. Importantly, Verification Services non-mortgage revenue was up 55% in the quarter, consistent with the very strong growth we saw last quarter. Our government vertical, which provides solutions to federal and state governments in support of assistance programs, including food and rental support, grew over 20% in the quarter. Government remains one of our largest non-mortgage segments with attractive growth potential in the future and represents about 1/3 of non-mortgage verification revenue. Our new SSA contract went live this quarter at relatively low start-up volumes, and we expect to see it ramp as we move through 2022. We expect new products, the addition of Appriss and expanded federal and state social services to fuel growth in our government vertical in the future. Talent solutions, which provides income employment verifications as well as other information for the hiring and onboarding processes through our EWS data hub, had another outstanding quarter from customer expansion and NPIs growing over 100%. Talent solutions now represents almost 30% of non-mortgage verification revenue. And as you know, over 75 million people change jobs in the U.S. annually, with the vast majority having some level of screening as a part of the hiring process. The addition of Appriss Insights and our new partnership with the National Student Clearinghouse will fuel growth and new products in this important vertical. The non-mortgage consumer lending business, principally in banking and auto, showed strong growth as well of about 90% in the quarter, both from deepening penetration with lenders and from some recovery in these markets, although auto has been impacted by inventory shortages. Employer Services revenue of $105 million was up $30 million in the quarter. This is an important growth engine for Workforce Solutions that also delivers records. Combined, our unemployment claims and employee retention credit businesses had revenue of about $65 million, up about $14 million from last year. Substantial declines in the UC revenue in the quarter were more than offset by ERC, which grew substantially -- sequentially as we support the businesses in obtaining federal employee retention credit payments. Employer Services non-UC and ERC businesses had revenue of about $40 million, up 60%, with organic growth of about 35%. Our I-9 business, driven by our new I-9 Anywhere product, continue to show very strong growth, up about 80%. Our I-9 business is now almost half of Employer Services non-UC and ERC revenue. Reflecting the growth in I-9 and the return to growth of Workforce Analytics, we expect Employer Services non-UC and ERC businesses to deliver total growth of about 40% and organic growth of about 25% in the year. Reflecting the uniqueness of the TWN data, strong verifier revenue growth and operating leverage resulted in adjusted Workforce Solutions EBITDA margins of 54.3%. The decline versus last year is driven by investments in the tech transformation as well as redundant systems costs and as well as significant investments in data onboarding, sales and marketing to continue to drive Workforce Solutions growth. Rudy Ploder and the Workforce Solutions team delivered another outstanding quarter and are positioned to deliver a very strong '21, '22 and beyond. Turning now to USIS. Their revenue of $380 million was up slightly from last year. Total USIS mortgage revenue of $148 million was down 17%, while mortgage credit inquiries were down 21%, slightly better than the down 23% we expected in July. USIS outperformance versus the overall market was driven by growth in marketing and debt monitoring products. Importantly, non-mortgage revenue of $240 million grew almost 8 -- sorry, 16% with organic growth of over 9%. Year-to-date, non-mortgage revenue was up a strong 17%, and organic non-mortgage revenue growth is over 10%. Banking, insurance, commercial and direct-to-consumer were all up over 10% in the quarter. Fraud was up almost 10% organically and up over 75% in total, with the inclusion of our Kount acquisition. Auto was up mid-single digits despite supply pressures, and telco was down just over 5%. Financial Marketing Services revenue, which is, broadly speaking, our off-line or batch business, was $55 million in the quarter and up about 20%. The strong performance was driven by marketing-related revenue, which was up over 20%; and ID and fraud revenue, which grew over 15%. In 2021, marketing-related revenue is expected to represent about 40% of FMS revenue; identity and fraud, above 20%; and risk decisioning, about 35%. The USIS sales team delivered record wins up over 20% versus last year and 40% sequentially in the quarter. The new deal pipeline in USIS remains very strong. During the quarter, USIS acquired Teletrack, a U.S. leader in alternative credit data. Teletrack is being consolidated with DataX, our specialty finance credit reporting agency that we acquired in 2018, to expand our capabilities in the fast-growing alternative data space serving unbanked and underbanked U.S. consumers. The USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 40% in the quarter, flat sequentially with second quarter. Similar to second quarter, the decline in margins in the quarter versus last year was due to both costs related to the cloud transformation, which include the cost of redundant systems and inclusion of our adjusted results of the technology transformation costs which are being excluded in 2020, and the expansion of our investments in sales and marketing as well as new products to leverage both the strengthening U.S. market and accelerate new product introductions to drive revenue growth in '22 and beyond. Turning to International. Their revenue of $245 million was up 10% on a local currency basis and up 100 basis points sequentially. This was the fourth consecutive quarter of growth in our global markets following the COVID pandemic impacts. Asia Pacific, which is principally our Australia business, performed well in the quarter with revenue of $89 million, up about 7% in local currency. Australia delivered this growth despite the extended COVID lockdowns in many portions of that country. Australia consumer revenue continued to recover, up 3% versus last year and about flat sequentially. Our Commercial businesses combined online and off-line revenue was up 8% in the quarter. Fraud and identity was up 13%, following 22% growth in the first half. European revenues of $68 million were up 9% in local currency in the quarter and flat sequentially. Our European credit reporting business was up about 5% with continued growth in both the U.K. and Spain. Our European debt management business revenue increased by about 21% in local currency, off the lows we saw last year during the COVID recession. Canada delivered revenue of $44 million in the quarter, up over 8% in local currency despite a weakening Canadian mortgage market that was down 15%. Canada experienced strong growth in fintech, while supply issues continue to impact our auto business. Latin American revenues of $45 million grew 16% in the quarter in local currency, which was the third consecutive quarter of growth coming out of COVID. We continue to see the benefit in Lat Am of the strong new product introductions introduced over the past 3 years. International adjusted EBITDA margins at 26.7% were down slightly from 27.3% in the second quarter. The sequential decline was driven by incremental technology costs in Australia and Canada as they accelerate their cloud transformation programs. The decline in the quarter was principally due to costs related to the cloud transformation, both the cost of redundant systems and inclusion in our adjusted results of the technology transformation costs, which were being excluded last year. Margins were negatively impacted the quarter by -- also negatively impacted the quarter by our increased investments in sales and marketing and new products. Global Consumer Solutions revenue of $82 million was down 6% on a reported basis and 7% on a local currency basis in the quarter, slightly above our expectations. We saw growth of about 2% in our global consumer direct business, which sells directly to consumers through equifax.com and represents a little over half of GCS revenue.  The decline in GCS revenue in the quarter was again driven by our U.S. lead gen partner business. We expect the GCS partner business and GCS business overall to return to growth in the fourth quarter. GCS adjusted EBITDA margins of 23.4% were up sequentially, reflecting lower operating costs. The decline versus last year was principally driven by revenue declines. Turning now to Slide 8. Workforce Solutions continues to power Equifax as it's clearly our strongest, fastest-growing and most valuable business, with strong 35% growth in the quarter, up 57% growth a year ago. Core revenue growth was 42%, driven by the uniqueness of the TWN income and employment data, scale of the TWN database and consistent execution by Rudy and his team. EWS' ability to consistently and substantially outgrow their underlying markets is driven by 3 factors. First, growing the work number database. At the end of the third quarter, TWN reached 125 million active records, an increase of 12% or 13 million records from a year ago and included 97 million unique records. At 97 million uniques, we now have over 60% of nonfarm payroll, which makes our TWN data set more valuable to our customers with higher hit rates. We are now receiving records every pay period from 1.9 million companies, up from 1 million when we started the year and 27,000 contributors a short 2 years ago. The exclusive agreement with a major payroll processor that we announced on our February call went live in the third quarter and contributed to this growth. Our strong momentum continues as we signed another large payroll processor last week on an exclusive basis that will come online in the coming months. We also expect to add further payroll processors in the coming months. As a reminder, almost 60% of our records are contributed directly by employers to which EWS provides comprehensive Employer Services like UC claims, W-2 management, I-9, WOTC, ERC, HSA and other HR and compliance solutions. Our acquisitions of HIREtech, i2verify and Health e(fx) this year strengthened our ability to deliver these unique HR services, particularly through relationships with payroll processors and HR software companies. These partnerships have been built up over the past decade by the Workforce Solutions team. The remaining 40% of our records are contributed through partnerships with payroll providers and HR software companies, most of which are exclusive. We still have substantial room to grow our income and employment database and expect to continue to add new data contributors as well as reach agreements with several additional payroll processors in the fourth quarter to add their records on an exclusive basis to TWN in 2022. Beyond the over 50 million nonfarm payroll records not yet in the TWN database, we're focused on data records from the 40 million to 50 million gig workers and around 30 million pension recipients in the U.S. marketplace to further broaden the TWN database. We have plenty of room to grow TWN. Second, increasing our average revenue transactions -- average revenue per transaction through new products and pricing, our existing products to value, recognizing the depth of information TWN allows us to deliver to customers. Workforce Solutions' new product pipeline is rapidly expanding as our teams leverage the power of our new Equifax Cloud capabilities. And third, by increasing our penetration in the markets we serve and expanding into new markets. For example, we continue to increase our penetration in the mortgage market. At the end of 2020, Workforce Solutions received an inquiry in almost 60% of completed mortgages, up from 55% in 2019. This 500 basis point increase is a big step forward, but we still have plenty of runway to expand the customers using TWN mortgage. We're also seeing substantial growth in TWN in other credit markets, including card and auto as these verticals take advantage of the unique lift from TWN income and employment data in the 60% hit rates with our database. Growing system-to-system integrations is another key lever in driving both increased penetration and increasing the number of poll per transaction. During the quarter, about 75% of TWN mortgage transactions were fulfilled system-to-system, up over 2x from 32% in 2019. And again, we still have plenty of growth potential here. Workforce Solutions is performing exceptionally well with attractive above-market and above Equifax growth rates and margins that we expect to continue in the future. Slide 9 highlights the core growth performance of our U.S. B2B mortgage businesses, Workforce Solutions and USIS. Our combined U.S. B2B businesses delivered 3% revenue growth in mortgage in the third quarter, outperforming the mortgage market by 24 basis points, with the market down 21%. This strong performance -- outperformance was again driven by Workforce Solutions with core mortgage growth of 43%, enabled by the multiple drivers that I just discussed. Slide 10 provides an update on new product innovation, leveraging the Equifax Cloud and our differentiated data, a key driver of our current and future growth. In the quarter, we delivered 30 new products with 150 new products in the market so far this year, which is up 18% from the 96 we delivered in the same time frame last year. We continue to expect our 2021 Vitality Index defined as a percent of revenue delivered from NPIs launched in the past 3 years to be over 8%. In the third quarter, we launched significant new products we expect to continue to drive growth in '22 and beyond. The SSA payroll exchange that went live as an EWS product that supports verifications of SSI and SSDI social services delivering critical income and employment status based on program requirements. OneView with DataX is a new integrated consumer credit report that redefines how we deliver display and provide insights to our customers. It also sets the stage for integrating nontraditional credit data in a single view solution for our customers. Alternative data from DataX, Teletrack, NC+, rental payments and other sources are a critical priority for Equifax, and we expect to continue to drive NPIs in this space in the future. Digital Identity Trust 2.0 product provides businesses with a comprehensive, passive identity verification service that delivers a trust/do not trust recommendation across both physical and digital identity vectors. This product will leverage Kount data by year-end. MarketMix Premier solution enables the ability for FIs to access market share and size of liquidity across geographics. This provides quick identification of targeted growth markets to deploy spend across branch sales and marketing efforts. And lastly, the new Equifax Affordability product in Australia uses bank transaction data and sophisticated categorization to provide an affordability view to customers while removing friction for the consumer. We're clearly focused on leveraging our new Equifax Cloud capabilities to drive our NPI rollouts and new product revenue in '21 and beyond. Growing the NPI is central to our EFX2023 growth strategy. As detailed on Slide 11, in 2021, we reinvest our strong outperformance in strategic and accretive bolt-on acquisitions that strengthen our position in existing growth markets and allow us to enter new markets with new capabilities. Our 2021 acquisitions add $300 million plus synergies to our run rate revenue. We are focused on executing acquisitions that are accretive to our long-term revenue growth and margins and deliver attractive shareholder returns. Our priorities for M&A are clear and aligned around, number one, expanding our differentiated data, which is at the core Equifax. We have scale and unique data sets that we want to expand and leverage with new data elements to drive enhanced decisioning for our customers. All of our acquisitions deliver new and differentiated data, and more data drive better decisions. Second, expanding and widening our largest and fastest-growing business, Workforce Solutions, is a priority for our M&A. The Appriss Insights, HIREtech, Health e(fx) and i2verify acquisitions strengthen Workforce and position EWS for future outperformance. And last, broadening our ID and fraud capabilities in the fast-growing digital and e-commerce space is another M&A priority. Kount strongly advanced our capabilities in this fast-growing space. We closed the Appriss acquisition on October 1 and are focused on integration, new solutions and growth. Appriss Insights and our new partnership with the National Student Clearinghouse are a big step forward in our strategy to build out an EWS Data Hub centered off our almost 500 million historical TWN data records to address the fast-growing talent and government markets. As detailed on Slide 12, combining our scale TWN data with Appriss Insights criminal and health care credentialing and sections data, along with other partner data assets, including the exclusive partnership for college and university data we entered into in the third quarter with the National Student Clearinghouse, allows Workforce Solutions to deliver the most complete, real-time, 360-degree view of the prospective employee or applicant for government benefits available in the market. The talent solutions and government verticals offer large and growing markets for our Workforce Solutions business through the EWS Data Hub. We estimate an addressable market of $5 billion in the U.S. hiring space and onboarding process, with around 75 million new employees onboarded annually in the U.S. Workforce Solutions government vertical is focused on delivering data and solutions to support federal and state benefit programs as well as law enforcement agencies. This is a substantial and growing sector that we estimate to have an addressable market of about $2 billion. Appriss Insights strongly accelerates our ability to penetrate these large and fast-growing TAMs. Insights is anticipated to generate $150 million of run rate revenue during 2021 and to grow on a stand-alone basis at over 15% annually. We also anticipate building towards approximately $75 million in revenue synergies by 2025, leveraging the EFX Cloud to integrate Appriss Insights' rich people-based risk intelligence data in the EWS Data Hub to form a new multi-data solutions and through cross-selling efforts. Acquiring Appriss Insights and partnering with the National Student Clearinghouse provide strong pillars for Workforce Solutions growth and fast-growing markets going forward. Slide 13 highlights our focus on adding alternative data to our database focused on the 60 million un or underbanked population in the United States. According to a Federal Reserve study, 6% of U.S. adults do not have a checking, savings or money market account, although 2/5 use some form of alternative financial service. Moreover, 16% of adults have a bank account but also use an alternative financial service product generally at much higher costs. Providing services that help bring these underserved populations into the financial mainstream is core to our purpose of helping people live their financial best and is an important priority for our customers. Our acquisition of Teletrack in September, which we are combining with our DataX business, creates a leading U.S. specialty consumer reporting agency with data on more than 80 million thin-file, unbanked and underbanked and credit rebuilding consumers. Our National Consumer Telecom & Utilities Exchange partnership is another unique data set focused on this space that has more than 420 million records and 250 million consumers, helping our customers to expand underwriting to no hit or thin-file customers. We are focused on expanding our unique alternative data from sources, including specialty finance companies, alternative lenders, telco companies, cable and satellite TV providers, municipalities and utilities to drive growth in the fast-growing alternative data markets. And we'll continue to look for opportunities to strengthen our alternative databases through partnerships and M&A. And now I'd like to turn it over to John to discuss our outlook for the rest of the year, our increase in guidance for 2021 as well as our -- share our early read on 2022 assumptions and our financial framework for 2022. John Gamble : Thanks, Mark. As Mark discussed, our 3Q results were very strong and much stronger than we discussed with you in July, with revenue about $50 million higher than the midpoint of the expectation we shared. For perspective, the strength was driven by our U.S. B2B businesses, principally Workforce Solutions and also USIS. Workforce Solutions Verification Services was stronger than discussed in July, principally in non-mortgage and talent solutions, card and auto as well as, to a lesser extent, in mortgage. Workforce Solutions employee retention credit and unemployment claims revenue was stronger than we discussed in July. We expect the strength in ERC to continue in the fourth quarter. USIS was also somewhat stronger than we discussed in July. The strength in mortgage relative to our discussion in July was partially a reflection of the mortgage market being down 21% versus the down 23% we discussed in July. Workforce Solutions' outperformance relative to the mortgage market was also stronger than we expected. This strong revenue drove upside in adjusted EPS relative to the expectations that we shared in July. Before discussing our increased guidance for 2021 and providing a framework for you to consider for 2022, let's briefly discuss our assumptions for the U.S. mortgage market. As shown on Slide 14, we are expecting the 21% year-to-year decline in U.S. mortgage credit inquiries that we saw in the third quarter to continue in the fourth quarter, with the fourth quarter down about 20%. This results in 2021 U.S. mortgage market credit inquiries being down just over 7% from 2020, slightly better than the down somewhat under 8% we discussed with you in July. For 2022, based on trends we are seeing in new purchase and refinance that I will discuss shortly, our 2022 framework assumes the U.S. mortgage market as measured by total credit market inquiries will decline about 15% from 2021. The 15% decline versus 2021 is most substantial in the first half of 2022, given the significant slowing we have seen in the U.S. mortgage market already in the second half of '21. Our assumed level of 2022 U.S. mortgage market credit inquiries remains over 10% above the average levels we saw over the 2015 to '19 period. The left side of Slide 15 provides perspective on the number of homes that would benefit by 75 basis points or more from refinancing their mortgage at current rates. Despite the substantial refinancing activity that's occurred over the past year and current increases in U.S. treasuries, the number of U.S. mortgages that could benefit from a refinancing remains at a relatively strong level of about 12 million. Home prices have appreciated significantly over the past 18 months, which has provided many homeowners with cash-out refinancing opportunities, which in past cycles has led to increased refinancing activity from borrowers. For perspective, based upon our most recent data in April, mortgage refinancings remain at just under 1 million a month. As shown on the right side of Slide 15, the pace of existing home purchases continues at historically very high levels. This strong new purchase market is expected to continue throughout '21 and '22. Our 2022 assumption for our U.S. mortgage credit inquiries assumes that we see purchase mortgage financings at levels above the levels we saw in 2020, with refinancings declining significantly from the levels we saw in both 2020 and 2021. Slide 16 provides our guidance for 4Q '21. We expect revenue in the range of $1.23 billion to $1.25 billion, reflecting revenue growth of about 10% to 11.8%, including a 0.1% benefit from FX. Acquisitions are expected to positively impact revenue by 5.4%. We're expecting adjusted EPS in 4Q '21 to be $1.72 to $1.82 per share compared to 4Q '20 adjusted EPS of $2 per share. In 4Q '21, technology transformation costs are expected to be around $45 million or $0.27 per share. Excluding these costs, which were excluded from 4Q '20 adjusted EPS, 4Q '21 adjusted EPS would be $1.99 to $2.09 per share. Slide 17 provides the specifics on our 2021 full year guidance. We are increasing guidance substantially, reflecting our very strong 3Q '21 performance. The acquisitions of Appriss, Health e(fx) and Teletrack are expected to add about $45 million of revenue in the quarter. 2021 revenue of between $4.901 billion and $4.921 billion reflects growth of about 18.7% to 19.2% versus 2020, including a 1.4% benefit from FX. Acquisitions are expected to positively impact revenue by about 3.1%. EWS is expected to deliver over 38% revenue growth with continued very strong growth in Verification Services. USIS revenue is expected to be up mid- to high-single digits, driven by growth in non-mortgage. Combined, EWS and USIS mortgage revenue is expected to be up over 18% in 2021, about 25 percentage points stronger than the overall market decline of just over 7%. International revenue is expected to deliver constant currency growth of about 10%. And GCS revenue is expected to be down mid-single digits in 2021. GCS revenue is expected to be up over 5% in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, in 2021, Equifax is including all cloud technology transformation costs and adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. These onetime costs were excluded from adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS in 2017 through 2020. In 2021, Equifax expects to incur onetime cloud technology transformation costs of approximately $165 million, a reduction of over 50% from the $358 million incurred in 2020. The inclusion in 2021 of these onetime costs would reduce adjusted EPS by about $1.01 per share. 2021 adjusted EPS of $7.52 to $7.62 per share, which includes these tech transformation costs, is up 7.8% to 9.3% from 2020. Excluding the impact of tech transformation cost of $1.01 per share, adjusted EPS in 2021 would show growth of about 22% to 24% versus 2020. 2021 is also negatively impacted by redundant system costs of about $80 million relative to 2020. These redundant system costs are expected to negatively impact adjusted EPS by approximately $0.50 per share and negatively impact adjusted EPS growth by about 7 percentage points in '21. We remain confident in our cloud transformation plan and the savings in 2022 and beyond that we have discussed previously with you. Now let's turn to a discussion of an early framework for 2022. Slide 18 provides the macro assumptions behind our 2022 framework. Given the continued significant uncertainties in the overall U.S. and global economy as well as in the U.S. mortgage market, we wanted to provide you with the assumptions we've been using at this stage in developing our framework for 2022. As I discussed previously, we expect the U.S. mortgage market, our proxy for which is U.S. mortgage credit inquiries, to decline about 15% in 2022 relative to 2021. Equifax's U.S. B2B mortgage revenue is expected to continue to significantly outperform the overall mortgage market and show growth in 2022 relative to 2021. Our overall framework is based on a continued U.S. economic recovery that is 2022 GDP growth of about 4% for the full year. We expect our USIS and Workforce Solutions non-mortgage businesses to outperform their underlying markets. We expect Workforce Solutions' UC and ERC businesses to decline by almost 30% in 2022. We also expect that International economies will continue to recover in 2022. Our International businesses are also expected to outperform their underlying markets. Slide 19 provides a view of Equifax's total and core revenue growth from 2017 through 2022 -- through the 2022 framework. In 4Q 2021, Equifax core revenue growth is expected to be a strong 17%, with core organic revenue growth of about 12%. Almost 2/3 of that core organic growth is driven by non-mortgage growth across all 4 BUs. In 2022, based on the assumptions I just shared, Equifax's total revenue is expected to be up about 8%. We anticipate delivering strong core revenue growth of 14%, reflecting organic growth of 11% -- organic core growth of 11% and a 3% benefit from acquisitions completed in 2021, which will more than offset the significant headwinds from the assumed declines in the U.S. mortgage market and the UC and ERC businesses. Slide 20 provides a revenue walk detailing the drivers of the 8% revenue growth in 2022 from the midpoint of our 2021 revenue guidance to the midpoint of our 2022 revenue framework, 2022 revenue of $5.3 billion. The 15% decline in the U.S. mortgage market and the expected declines in the Workforce Solutions unemployment claims and ERC businesses are expected to negatively impact revenue in 2022 by 5.75 percentage points. Core organic revenue growth is anticipated to be over 11%. Non-mortgage core organic growth is expected to drive about 2/3 of the growth. The largest contributor is Workforce Solutions with strong organic growth in talent solutions, government and employee boarding solutions, including I-9. USIS non-mortgage, International and GCS are also expected to drive core growth. Mortgage revenue outperformance relative to the overall mortgage market is expected to drive the remaining about 1/3 of the organic core growth. This is driven by strong outperformance in Workforce Solutions. The acquisitions completed in 2021 are expected to contribute about 3 percentage points of growth to 2022. Slide 21 provides an adjusted EPS walk, detailing the drivers of the expected 14% growth from the midpoint of the 2021 guidance of $7.57 per share to the midpoint of our 2022 framework of $8.65 per share. Revenue growth of 8% at our 2021 EBITDA margins of about 33.8% would deliver 11% growth in adjusted EPS. In 2022, we expect to deliver EBITDA margin expansion of about 200 basis points. This margin expansion is expected to drive 9% growth in adjusted EPS. This margin expansion is expected to be delivered by the actions we have discussed with you throughout 2021. Our transformation investments will be reduced by about $100 million in 2022, with about half of this reduction or about $50 million being reinvested in new product and other development. We will begin to see net cloud cost savings in 2022 defined as the savings from improving production costs, driven by the decommissioning of our legacy on-prem systems and other improvements in our operations exceeding the cost of running our new cloud-native systems. Margins will also be enhanced by leverage on corporate and G&A. Partly offsetting these benefits to EBITDA are cost increases, particularly in salaries and contracted services as the tight labor market drives cost higher as well as lower EBITDA margins in 2022 from the 2021 acquisitions as we will just be ramping synergies during 2022. Depreciation and amortization is expected to increase by about $45 million in 2022, which will negatively impact adjusted EPS by about 4%. D&A is increasing in 2022 as we accelerate putting cloud-native systems into production. The combined increase in interest expense and tax expense in 2022 is expected to negatively impact adjusted EPS by about 2 percentage points. The increase in interest expense reflects the increased debt from our 2021 acquisitions. Our estimated tax rate used in this framework of 24.5% does not assume any changes in the U.S. federal tax rate. Should that occur, we will let you know the estimated impact on our 2022 results. As there remains significant uncertainty in underlying market drivers, including the pace of normalization of the U.S. mortgage market and the pace of economic growth worldwide, what we provided today for 2022 is a framework for you to consider. We'll provide formal guidance for 2022 in connection with our 4Q '21 earnings release early next year. Now I would like to turn it back over to Mark. Mark Begor : Thanks, John. We hope this early view of our framework for 2022 is helpful and reinforces the power of the new Equifax to deliver 14% growth and 8% total growth at the midpoint of our range of thinking, assuming the mortgage market and UC and ERC declines impact our revenue growth by almost 6% in 2022. Stepping back and reviewing the macro trends outlined on Slide 22. These macros have been driving information services for the last decade. Over the last 24 months, we believe most of the macro factors have substantially accelerated. And through our 2021 acquisitions of Appriss, Kount and Teletrack and our EFX Cloud investments advantaged Equifax to benefit from these macro trends. We believe we also have unique levers at Equifax to deliver strong future growth, including Workforce Solutions above market and EFX growth and margins and our expanded focus on new data assets like Appriss Insights, the USIS recovery and non-mortgage growth and Kount ID and fraud growth; the new Equifax Cloud, which is driving our competitiveness NPIs top line and cost savings; and NPIs leveraging Equifax Cloud and our expanded resources and focus on new products; and then, of course, M&A to broaden strength in Equifax. These attractive market macros along with the broad Equifax growth levers and our strong core outperformance in the past few years give us the confidence in our ability to deliver above-market growth in the future. Wrapping up on Slide 23. Equifax delivered another strong and broad-based quarter. We had strong momentum as we move into the fourth quarter to 2022. We now delivered 7 consecutive quarters of strong, above-market, double-digit growth, reflecting the power of the new Equifax business model and our execution against our EFX2023 strategic priorities. Equifax is on offense. We remain confident in our outlook for 2021 and raised our full year midpoint revenue growth rate by approximately 300 basis points to 19% growth for the year. And we also raised our midpoint EPS by $0.22 to $7.57 per share. Workforce Solutions had another outstanding quarter, powering our results, delivering 35% revenue growth and 54% EBITDA margins. EWS is our largest, fastest-growing and most valuable business, and Rudy and his team remain focused on delivering outsized growth. USIS also delivered a strong quarter with 16% non-mortgage growth and 9% organic non-mortgage growth, offsetting the impact of a sharp over 20% decline in the mortgage market. Sid Singh and his USIS team remain competitive and are winning in the marketplace. International grew for the fourth consecutive quarter with 10% growth in local currency as economies reopen and business activity resumes outside the United States. We have high expectations for International as we move into 2022. We spent the past 3 years building the Equifax Cloud and are now in the early days of leveraging the new and uniquely Equifax Cloud capabilities. As we move into '22 and beyond, we will increasingly realize the top line cost and cash benefits from these new only Equifax Cloud capabilities. As I mentioned earlier, our 2021 M&A has added $300 million of run rate revenue to Equifax. Reinvesting our strong cash flow in accretive and strategic bolt-on M&A is central to our EFX2023 growth strategy. We're now focused on integrating these acquisitions and executing our synergy and growth plans in order to leverage our new data products and capabilities. Our early look at a 2022 financial framework calls for 8% revenue growth and adjusted EPS growth of 14%, assuming a 15% decline in the mortgage market. More importantly, the framework includes strong 14% EFX growth -- core EFX growth. 2022 will be a pivotal year for Equifax as we shift towards leveraging the Equifax Cloud for innovation, new products and growth. And lastly, turning to Slide 24. Many of you have been closely following Equifax for many years and know we've been speaking to you about -- for some time about our plan to have our first Investor Day, which will be our first Investor Day since 2012 and the cyber event. It's been a long time. Let me now turn it over to Dorian, who will give you the details on our November 10 meeting focused on the new Equifax, and then we'll take some questions. Dorian Hare : Thanks, Mark. I'm energized to announce that our Investor Day will take place on November 10 at 8 :30 a.m. Eastern Time and will be held virtually. We've opened up online registration as of today, and the link to do so on Slide 24 is live. We are very excited to have the opportunity to update you on the progress we have made in making and executing our EFX2023 growth strategy; share with you our long-term financial framework and also our capital allocation plan; speak with you about how we are and will continue to leverage our EFX Cloud capabilities, including by continuing to accelerate our new product innovations; and provide you with overviews of the state of affairs of our business units relayed by their respective leaders. Investor Day will be an important day for our company and stakeholders, and we look forward to speaking with you then. With that, operator, let me open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first questions come from the line of David Togut with Evercore. David Togut : I appreciate the helpful detail in the initial 2022 framework. It appears that you're guiding above consensus for fourth quarter 2021 revenue and for 2022 revenue but somewhat below consensus on earnings per share for both the fourth quarter and for next year. John, you walked through some of the sources of pressure on margin for 2022. But I'm wondering if you could talk more broadly about headwinds and tailwinds so we can understand the variance. Is it really the $50 million, for example, of tech transformation savings that you're reinvesting in the business next year? John Gamble : Yes. Happy to. So again, as a reminder, right, we're talking about increasing EBITDA margins by -- on the order of 200 basis points, so a substantial increase in 2022 versus 2021, yes. And I think the drivers are what we've been talking about all year, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. We are reducing substantially tech transformation costs, but we are taking a significant amount of that in the order of $50 million and reinvesting it in NPI and other initiatives to drive growth and to deliver the higher revenue growth you're talking about, that you referenced in your question. Also, we do expect now to start seeing benefits, so net reductions in costs from decoms exceeding our cloud costs, and that will ramp as we go through 2022. And then -- but we are seeing some increased costs related to -- related -- in our COGS, as you would normally expect, related to increased costs for people and increased cost for some systems costs that are reducing 2021 EBITDA margins to a degree. That's not actually that unusual, generally speaking. Generally speaking, we see increased cost every year that we manage through high growth. Next year, part of what's happening, obviously, right, is we're seeing substantial negative impacts on our revenue from the weaker mortgage market as well as the reductions in EC -- sorry, in the UC and ERC markets. So that negative drive in revenue is also somewhat negatively impacting our margin expansion. But overall, 200 basis points of margin expansion next year, we think, is really an outstanding performance, especially given the fact that we're seeing such large declines in the mortgage market and then also the declines in the UC and ERC revenue that we talked about on the order of 30%. David Togut : Just as a quick follow-up. In your initial 2022 financial framework, you're guiding to 11.3% core organic revenue growth. Within that number, what is your expectation for EWS organic growth? And how do you think about headwinds and tailwinds for EWS next year? John Gamble : Yes. So I think in terms of the details around how the BUs are going to perform next year, we're going to have to ask you to wait until November 10. But Obviously, we expect EWS to continue to perform extremely well. Mark Begor : You should obviously -- we've been quite clear that we expect Workforce Solutions to grow above the rest of Equifax. So I think you should think about it that way in 2022. I went through -- we've been through many, many times, the multiple levers that Workforce, for example, has as they finish up the year and go into 2022, and records starts at the top of that list. Adding substantial records in the third quarter, those become a benefit through the next year, their new product introductions, continued penetration. There's a lot of levers in that business. USIS, their new deal pipeline is a positive lever going forward. But Workforce is clearly going to be above that -- the rest of Equifax for really as long as we can see in the future from a growth rate standpoint. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Mark, you talked about the vitality index up over 8%. Any sense of where you think that can go to? I mean, obviously, there's been a really significant step-up in the new product innovation. And what that can mean to the organic growth longer term? Mark Begor : It's clearly a priority, Kevin. As you know, since I joined almost 4 years ago and really in the last, call it, 24 months, we've really stepped up our focus on new products. As you know, we've expanded the team. John and I both talked about it in our comments this morning about continuing to invest there. And of course, the cloud transformation is central to that. That's really -- we're going to get great benefits from the cloud around cost, but we really did it to change our competitiveness. And the big piece of that is the ability to bring new products to market that we couldn't do before through multi-data solutions. And that's really where our focus is, and we're in the early days of really leveraging that. So we see real opportunities going forward. We'll certainly talk in depth in our Investor Day in a couple of weeks around our longer-term outlook for new products. But it's an area that we've invested heavily, foundationally in the cloud. You add to that our existing differentiated data assets, which we've expanded substantially this year with the addition of new data solutions from Appriss, from Kount, from Teletrack and then our focus on new products. We believe it's an important lever for delivering strong future growth going forward, and we'll give you much more detail during our Investor Day. Kevin McVeigh : And then just real quick on the customer migrations, it seems like you made a lot of progress on that. Where are you in that process? And then are you seeing any incremental step-up in revenue as these customers have cut over? Like is there any way to think about what the revenue impact has been? Just -- I know it's a hard question, but just like what percentage step-up you're seeing as these customers have converted? Mark Begor : Yes. First on the progress, this is a big undertaking. I think you know that. We talk to you about it every quarter. We try to be quite transparent about the efforts. 2018, '19 and parts of '20 were building the technology. In '20 and '21, we've been heavily focused on implementing that with our customers, the migration. You've seen the great progress. We still got more to do. And we were clear that we expect North America, which is Canada, U.S. and EWS and USIS and, of course, TCS to be substantially complete as we get in 2022 and really complete the migrations next year. So we can see the finish line, but there's still plenty of work to do in the coming months to complete that. With regards to our impact commercially, there's a number of layers on that. And this is another area -- our intent is to go in substantial detail about how we think about that, what we're seeing during our Investor Day. We'll have our Chief Technology leader and product leader, Bryson Koehler, as well as the business unit leaders will talk about that. But you're starting to see some of the early days of that, in our view. The strong core growth, the ability to roll out new products are driving our competitiveness and driving our ability to drive our core growth. And there's no question, when we sit down with customers, we believe we're advantaged having a new tech stack that's in the cloud that can deliver 9-9s of stability, meaning very high, always-on stability, deliver data more quickly to our customers. We can deliver new products to them more quickly. It just changes who we are as a company, and it allows us to be a different company. So it's quite central to how we think about the new Equifax going forward, and it will be central to our long-term growth framework that we'll share with you in a couple of weeks. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Kyle Peterson with Needham & Company. Kyle Peterson : Just wanted to touch on the U.S. auto market. I know there's been a lot of concerns over chip shortages and supply constraints potentially impacting auto credit. Thinking out [indiscernible] that it's been a little bit of a headwind to Canada, but what are you guys seeing in the U.S., particularly in the USIS segment for auto credit? Mark Begor : Yes, similar, we could have and should have commented on that in the U.S. also. There's no question that the supply shortages are impacting the ability for consumers to identify cars or get cars, new and used and then, of course, the financing that comes with that and the business we get from that. What's been offsetting that to some regard, not fully, but is our continued penetration of new products and new solutions, like Workforce Solutions continuing to grow the use of TWN data in the auto space has been a positive. Would you add anything, John? John Gamble : No, I'd say that covers it. And we're -- the good news is we're continuing to grow in USIS and auto on an organic basis even in the headwinds of the difficult market. But yes, it certainly isn't at the pace that we expected when we started the year. Kyle Peterson : Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess just a follow-up on EWS. Obviously, good to see really strong record growth in TWN and continued share gains. Moving forward, how should we think about records growth? I know you guys mentioned a few additional payroll processing partnerships in the pipeline. But how should we think about records and kind of a greenfield between some of these alternative data sources like gig workers and pension versus traditional W-2 records that you guys are going to see as prospects? Mark Begor : Yes. It's obviously an important focus of Rudy and the Workforce Solutions team. You've seen continued success there. And remember, we've got 2, really, levers for growth. First, our Employer Services business, which is large and comprehensive as we've delivered new solutions to HR managers around I-9 or HSA or W-2 or WOTC, all the other services. We access payroll records. So that's a very powerful engine for us to go to individual companies to obtain records. And of course, we feel like we have some real momentum in adding the payroll processors that are not with us and going after the traditional nonfarm payroll. There's still 60 million-plus consumers or individuals that are available for us in the traditional nonfarm, and we're chasing that. So that's one. And of course, with records being up 12% in the quarter, that is a very strong lever for growth that translates pretty directly into revenue because of higher hit rates. As you point out, there's also a larger universe, the nonfarm payroll, the 160 million, 170 million that are in nonfarm payroll, the gig workers as well as pension recipients. Those are 2 big areas. There's 40 million to 50 million gig workers. So we're working different strategies to obtain those records and then the same with pension recipients. So there's a long runway from our roughly 60% of nonfarm payroll. If you include self-employed and gig in there, it's much less than the 60% to continue to grow our records, which is a very unique business growth lever for our business to continue to add new data assets because, as you know, in our system-to-system integrations in Workforce Solutions, we're getting the inquiries. We can only fulfill those that we have records on. And as we grow our records, they become monetized tomorrow afternoon. So that's very powerful. And the scale of Workforce gives us the ability to have large, dedicated teams both on the partnership side and on the direct side through Employer Services to continue to grow our records. And we'll likely talk a little bit at Investor Day about our International expansion, which, as you know, we're already in Canada, Australia and India. And those businesses are also growing their records, leveraging the core tech stack that we have from Workforce Solutions in the U.S. but also relationships that we have, either with multinationals or with payroll processors and, of course, growing those records locally. So big, big focus and big opportunity going forward. When you think about records, I think about us being in kind of middle innings still as far as the opportunity for Workforce Solutions. And these take time. The payroll processor we signed last week, we were probably talking to them for 3 years. It takes time to get organized around that. But there's real momentum particularly in that area of acquisition because so many others have signed up with Equifax and are having a positive experience. We're seeing real momentum there in adding other processors. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of George Mihalos with Cowen and Company. Georgios Mihalos : I appreciate you're willing to go out to 2022 in this environment. Very helpful as always. I guess, first question for me, John, if we can kind of circle back to the first question, just as it relates around margins for '22. I think you had said previously savings from redundancies and obviously, the tech transformation, we're going to be about, call it, $150 million. You're reinvesting $50 million of that now, it sounds like, so net $100 million. That roughly, by my math, gets us to kind of the 36% margin at sort of the high end, the 200 basis point increase. Is the reason why margins aren't expected to be higher than that, that the natural margin expansion within the business is being offset by some dilution from M&A and just sort of higher inflation-related expenses as it relates to wages? Is that roughly the way to think about it? John Gamble : Yes. So George, as I walked through in my comments, right, so you're absolutely right. So we indicated we were going to -- we would improve our cost structure by -- on the order of $100 million by taking down transformation costs. And then we also said we'd improve our cost structure as we drove net savings, right, as decom and other cost reduction efforts drove us -- or exceeded cloud. And so we absolutely have indicated we're going to deliver on those savings, and we're still committed to delivering substantial savings in both of those areas in 2022 and beyond. But you are correct. Also, as I mentioned in my comments, we're reinvesting a substantial portion of that $50 million in new development and new development-related activities. Also, if you think about what's going on, given the fact that we're seeing a 600 basis point headwind, like the natural growth that you'd see in our underlying business that has the very high variable margins, that's somewhat lower than you would see in a period in which mortgage is not as negative as you're talking about. And you're correct, right, we're getting a nice bump from growth in acquisitions next year. But the EBITDA margins on those acquisitions in their first year is substantially lower than the contribution margin we get by growing our internal data assets. So when you kind of line all that stuff up and you include the fact that we are seeing cost increases as we do every year, right, that's certainly something we see every year, but there is a tighter labor market, so there's an expectation that some of those cost increases will be greater. When you line all those items up, you end up at about a 200 basis point increase is where we're comfortable talking about right now. Also, I just want to remind everybody, 200 basis points, right, and again, a 6% reduction in mortgage and UC, ERC is really a substantial improvement. We feel very good about delivering that. And so hopefully, the investment community can look at it in that vein. Mark Begor : And George, I would add to that, we'll obviously talk about a long-term framework for revenue and margins in a couple of weeks. And we've been quite clear that we see a lot of ability to grow the top line -- or we're confident in our ability to grow our top line long term at above-market level as well as expand our margins. And we've also been very clear that while we have the ability to expand margins over the long-term basis, we're also going to invest in the business. We have the ability to invest in new products. And obviously, the tech transformation, which we're completing, it has really high leverage in driving the top line. So we'll continue to have that balance going forward of expanding margins while investing in the future of Equifax. Georgios Mihalos : Okay. Great. I appreciate that because I think that's what's weighing on the stock this morning. So really, really appreciate you are breaking it down like that. And then just quickly, Mark, I think if I caught it correctly, you talked about as it relates to record growth going after some more of these -- what I think of as more unbanked individuals, gig workers and the like. Can you talk about the challenges or how you go about sourcing data from that constituency as opposed to traditional W-2 worker and the like? Is it going to require sort of a different effort in terms of going after like fintechs to partner with? Or how are you thinking about that? Mark Begor : Yes. First, our primary focus is to continue to grow W-2 income kind of payroll records, and you see that we've had strong success in that over the last couple of years. And certainly again in the quarter, we're continuing to add to that. There's still a long runway there. When you think about 60 million, 70 million of additional individuals that are not in our data set that are inside of that, so that's kind of a primary focus. And then as you point out, we're expanding into gig. Some of the same relationships we have, companies process on their own contractor payroll, we'll be able to pick that up. Some payroll processors have kind of self-employed solutions where there's an ability to pick up data that way. There's other HR software providers that will help us through partnerships lead to some of those kind of records. And of course, the pensioner income at 20 million to 30 million comes from individual companies that process their own pension income or other companies that do that for companies. So we've got a multifaceted approach on that. Really, the point we make in identifying that is that our lens is wider now, and there's still a long runway of this important lever to grow records Workforce Solutions. As you know, we don't talk about adding data assets in our other businesses. What's unique about Workforce is that it's only a decade old, and it only has 60% of nonfarm payroll, so there's a ton of room to grow. And then that gets bigger, as we both pointed out, as you add gig and pension into that space. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Toni Kaplan : I wanted to start with Appriss. At the time of the acquisition, you had talked about strong accretion in '22 from that deal along with the Health e(fx) and Teletrack acquisitions. I guess, how much is embedded in your '22 EPS expectations from the deals? And maybe you could help with some of the assumptions behind the significant accretion because I think some investors and myself were getting a little bit more neutral. John Gamble : So it's absolutely accretive in 2022. Certainly, I'm not going to give a specific number for the level of accretion for the acquisitions. But kind of similar to the response I just gave with regard to margin movements, so we do expect good EBITDA margins from those acquisitions. And the level of margin that we're generating from that certainly exceeds the cost of the interest expense, which we also detailed in our revenue book. So we're seeing nice accretion, and so -- which would be consistent with strong from what we talked about back in August. But just in general, right, the level of margins we look at from an acquired company like Appriss or anybody else in the first year out, the incremental margin we generate from those companies isn't anywhere near the level of incremental margin we generate from incremental organic sales at Equifax. So the reason why they're somewhat dilutive to our EBITDA margin in total is because of the fact that the variable margin we achieved on our direct sales is certainly substantially higher than the level of margin we generate from the acquired company in its first year out. Toni Kaplan : Got it. And then just looking at the revenue trends in the appendix, look like non-mortgage online info in U.S. was good at positive 15%, but it did decelerate relative to last quarter. Is that because of the auto softness? Or are there other verticals that are impacting that as well? And it does seem like the banks are talking about the lending environment getting better. Are you expecting that in the fourth quarter or next year? It did look like in your levers page, your macro levers page that maybe it gets better. But I'm just trying to understand sort of how much that is going to be a driver and what you're seeing in the lending environment. John Gamble : I think the biggest driver of the growth rates that you're looking at really is the fact that in 2020, we saw a meaningful improvement in the third quarter relative to the second, right? So the growth rate in the second quarter of 2020, as we talked about when we did the release, was elevated partially because of the fact that it was such a weak quarter and we saw some improvements in the third quarter last year, right? So that's part of what's driving the fact that the -- that's a significant driver of what's driving the growth rates to be down. But in terms of overall performance, I think as Mark referenced, we feel good about banking and lending. We have a nice growth there in the quarter, again, as we -- we had nice growth in insurance, nice growth in commercial. Identity and fraud was strong. And importantly, Financial Marketing Services was very strong, right? So -- but again, as you look into the fourth quarter, similarly to what I just talked about the fourth quarter of last year was a nice improvement from the third quarter. So we'll have some of the grow-over effects that we talked about in the third quarter. But we continue to believe we're going to see nice non-mortgage growth in USIS in the fourth quarter. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Andrew Nicholas : My first question was just going to be on the talent solutions business. Obviously, as it gets to become a bigger and bigger piece of Workforce Solutions, I think you said 30% of non-mortgage. Just wondering how you think about the cyclicality of that business. We've talked about the tight labor market. But as you're thinking about '22 in particular and embedding that type of growth or some level of growth for that business, how do you think about new product innovation relative to existing client growth or hiring activity and how that impacts performance in that business over a shorter time frame? Mark Begor : Yes. First, I think the underlying macro of 75 million people changing jobs every year, that macro doesn't really change much over time, meaning lots of people change jobs, and that may go up or down at some. But underlying that is that there's some level of data used in each of those job moves. So that's a macro that's quite good. The other thing that's changing that we think is going to be a permanent change is the desire by companies to complete that process more quickly. Meaning they've made an offer to someone getting them on the floor in the warehouse or the factory or in the retail establishment or in the restaurant in hours or days versus weeks. And the only way to do that is through instant decisioning. So I think that's the fundamental structural change in the business, the ability to use data to speed up the processes. For us, what we're really having the growth in is building out this data hub, which remember is only a year old or whatever. We're starting to leverage the 4.5, 5 jobs we have in the average American from our TWN database. Remember 0.5 billion of historical records and then adding to it new data elements like Appriss Insights, like medical credentialing, the National Student Clearinghouse of Education, that's all new turf for Equifax. As we combine those, you're going to see products coming out. You already are. We're rolling out new products quite rapidly for talent solutions where we have different solutions of more or less historical data. And we'll move to, in the coming year, solutions that are more targeted to specific jobs, a job that requires what was your last employer, what was your last 2 employers, verifying your licenses, verifying where did you go to school. Some jobs require that, some don't. So we'll come up with solutions that will be packaged to speed up that process for the background screeners and the hiring managers in order to speed up the ability to hire that individual more quickly. So we see a lot of opportunity for growth in that. That's a $5 billion TAM. Our business is quite small when you think about $5 billion worth of data. And that's why we're investing through new products and through innovation and, of course, through the acquisitions that we've made or the new partnerships like the National Student Clearinghouse. Andrew Nicholas : Great. That's helpful. And then just 2 quick modeling questions. The first was, I think the legacy system savings that you had outlined in prior investor presentations was $85 million year-over-year. I just want to make sure that's still the number to think about. And then also, if you wouldn't mind speaking to whether or not the SSA contract was fully ramped this quarter. John Gamble : Yes. So in terms of modeling, again, for 2022, what I'd ask you to focus on is the guidance we just gave, right? So what we try to do is give you a fairly detailed walk from this year to next year. And obviously, there's a lot of moving parts in what's driving our EBITDA margin movement, which was some of the questions we had earlier. So I ask would be a focus on the walk we gave in the 200 basis points of margin expansion when you think about 2022 relative to 2021. Mark Begor : And on SSA in our comments, we -- I noted that we launched the program. We started delivering data to them at kind of early levels. And we expect that to ramp as we go through the fourth quarter and into 2022 and get to run rate sometime in 2022. It's a substantial and positive contract for us, but it's in the start-up mode now, which is positive to have it started after a lot of years of building this new solution and getting it integrated with SSA. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Hamzah Mazari : My question is just around the integration of the M&A you've done. You kind of talked about 2022 seeing synergies roll through. Could you just give us examples maybe what integration is yet to come? What's behind you? And then when do you reengage in the M&A market? Is it more of a -- can you do that next year? Or is sort of we wait until this integration is done and then you get back more aggressive on M&A? Just any thoughts on that. Mark Begor : Yes. No. We're actively -- as you know, we have completed 8 acquisitions this year and a couple of them substantial, particularly Kount and Appriss. We're much further along on integrating Kount, as you might imagine, because we completed that deal in the first quarter. Appriss was only completed a couple of weeks ago, so we're still early days of starting that integration. The cloud allows us to integrate more quickly. And as you know, our focus is to bring their unique data into our single data fabric. So that's underway with all of the acquisitions in order to drive their growth going forward. And we're seeing in Kount early positive days of top line synergies and very pleased with the plan on that acquisition. And we're very energized about Appriss and, of course, all the other acquisitions that we completed. The synergies from these acquisitions, I think we've been very clear when we announced the acquisitions, come in over multiple years. They start in year 1, like in 2021, there's some early synergies, they build. And year 2, in this case, 2022 for those 2 acquisitions and then they'll continue. And we've talked about kind of year 5 synergies in some of the acquisitions being quite substantial, and those build over time as you roll out the new solutions, the new products and fully integrate the business into our cloud capabilities and our single data fabric. With regards to your second question, we were clear when we announced Appriss a couple of months ago that we were going to pause on substantial M&A for a number of quarters, number one, to focus on integration; and number two, to bring our leverage back in line. So to answer your question, we would expect to be back doing M&A in the latter half of 2022 or somewhere in that time frame. We haven't stopped our corporate dev team of continuing to be in the market to look for M&A that would be a meaningful and accretive. And I hope you get a sense that we're quite disciplined about the kind of M&A we want to do. We've been very clear for a number of years about acquisitions we want to do around differentiated data, identity and fraud and broadening and strengthening Workforce Solutions. And the deals we've done this year have checked all those boxes, and you should expect the deals going forward to do the same. And also with the financial discipline that over the long term, they're accretive to our long-term growth rates and into our margins. We want to do deals that strengthen Equifax, broaden Equifax, but also enhance our financials and drive shareholder value. Hamzah Mazari : That's very helpful. And just a follow-up question. Just on the International business. I know you flagged your expectation of Australia GDP for 2022. But any -- do you expect to see benefits from the tech transformation on the International business as early as next year? Or does that come a bit later? Mark Begor : Most of it comes later, although Canada is well down the path of their tech transformation. They should get some benefits in '22. And there's some early benefits in U.K. and Spain and Australia as we get into 2022. But the bulk of that is going to really come particularly in Latin America in the latter parts of the year as we get into 2023. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Andrew Steinerman : Two questions. The first one, could you just tell us how much mortgage revenues as a percentage of total third quarter Equifax revenues there was? My second question is about tech transformation expense. I want to know if you can indicate what the tech transformation expense drag on '22 EPS is compared to the $1.01, the $1.01 for '21, which is referenced on Slide 7, Footnote 5. John Gamble : Yes. So in terms of the mortgage as a percent of total, it's just under 32%, and that's obviously down significantly from where it was last year, and it will go down again in the fourth quarter. So in terms of tech transformation expense, I think what we've indicated is that this year, we expect to incur about $165 million, and that's how you get to the $1.01. And we've indicated that we expect to reduce by about $100 million. It's not a perfect number, right, but by about $100 million next year. So that would be on the order to -- on the order of $60 million to $65 million next year. But obviously, we'll refine that as we move through the fourth quarter and give you a really formal guidance as we get into early next year. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. George Tong : Your 3Q revenues beat guidance by about $50 million, while your full year guidance increased by about $130 million at the midpoint. I know Appriss is adding $150 million in annual revenue. But how much of the increase in the guide above the 3Q outperformance is due to contributions from Appriss and other acquisitions versus improved assumed performance in 4Q with the underlying business? John Gamble : Yes. I think we indicated in our prepared remarks, it's about $45 million. Mark Begor : In the fourth quarter. John Gamble : In the fourth quarter. Sorry. Mark Begor : Acquisitions, George. George Tong : Okay. Got it. And the remainder from performance -- outperformance in the underlying business? Mark Begor : Correct. George Tong : Okay. And then in your slides, you mentioned that USIS non-mortgage is expected to outperform the underlying margins in 2022. How much of that outperformance is due to M&A? And how much is due to organic outperformance versus underlying markets? Mark Begor : You're breaking up, but I think your question, George, was in 2022, our mortgage outperformance, how much is from M&A versus the core business. Is that right? George Tong : Yes, versus organic. Yes. Mark Begor : Yes, it's substantially all organic. John Gamble : Yes. So if the question was non-mortgage in USIS, then our statement was intended to be organic, right? So we're expecting them to outperform their core market on an organic basis. Mark Begor : And the Workforce Solutions acquisitions are -- really don't have an impact on their outperformance in mortgage. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Jeffrey Meuler with Baird. Jeffrey Meuler : Yes. On '22 margins, are you viewing '22 as a year where it's still pretty depressed by onetime expenses? Or are you viewing it as a good kind of underlying baseline where there's always going to be some puts and takes? I guess there's still $65 million of TTI on top of that. I think even though the net cloud costs are going down, there's still probably some fairly material duplicative systems cost that you can work down over time. Not trying to ask if you're at peak margin because I know you can increase margins at the acquired businesses, you have good incrementals on organic. But just trying to understand if you're viewing '22 as still a fairly depressed figure or if it's a good underlying for us to consider how we go forward from thereon. Mark Begor : Well, I'll start on that one, and John can jump in. We'll -- in a couple of weeks in our Investor Day presentation, we'll certainly give you our long-term framework around top line and margin growth. And we've been very clear, you should expect that to include our ability to grow our margins going forward. And '22 is clearly -- I don't know if you want to call it still a transitionary year. There's -- you've got the mortgage market impact, obviously. And then as you point out, we still have substantial cloud transformation costs in 2022. So we're not at a normal run rate in 2022. John? John Gamble : No, you covered it, right? So we just -- I think we just had an earlier question about how much transformation expense was still -- investment was still in 2022, and we gave a number of -- we're at $165 million this year, and we said we'd reduce by about $100 million, so that's still in the P&L next year. And then also, we are delivering cloud savings. So our net cloud cost over decommissioning is a positive next year. But we've given a long-term model where we expect to deliver substantial savings when the cloud transformation is complete. We're still committed to that, right? So the exact timing as you move through any given year, obviously, moves around a lot based on decommissionings and the pace of ramp of individual systems. So it's hard to be specific in any -- about any specific number as far as 15 months out. But we are absolutely committed to delivering a net savings next year versus the net cost this year. And then also there's substantial savings still to come as we get through 2022 and then -- and into '23 and '24. Obviously, those don't complete until we complete the International transformation. Jeffrey Meuler : Very helpful. And then we get asked a lot about BNPL and if it's cannibalistic to card, including from a bureau transaction or underwriting perspective. I would expect you to have a pretty unique view into that given Australia is a more developed BNPL market, plus you obviously have a nice bureau share there. So would just love your thoughts on BNPL and over time, if you'd expect it to be cannibalistic to card or not. Mark Begor : That's a different question about cannibalistic card. As far as a card issuer, I think some card issuers are probably seeing some pressure from BNPL, meaning consumers are using that instead of using their credit card to make purchases. When it comes to Equifax and our industry is providing data, BNPL, we sell a bunch of identity data to BNPL players around the globe. And increasingly, they're starting to use alternative data as a part of their underwriting, even in some -- many cases, credit data, meaning credit file data going forward. So I think if you look at the total pie on consumers using cash or debit versus BNPL and credit, the pie is growing, meaning consumers are using this as another way to finance their purchases, which from an Equifax perspective, we view as a good thing. And we've got discussions with all of the BNPL players about using our data and our identity data because you have to verify the identity of the consumer before you offer them financing even on a pair of jeans, so going forward. So we view it as a net positive for the credit bureaus and Equifax. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Manav Patnaik : John, I agree the 200 basis point margin expansion is obviously strong given all the headwinds. But I was hoping you could just help us maybe with some order of magnitude. I heard 3 things that are the tight labor market and that increase in cost, the acquisition impact and then the 600 basis point decline in EC and UC revenues or whatever. So like how much of a headwind were each of those? Mark Begor : I would start with number one is that, Manav, we're continuing to invest more next year than this year. We're intending to around new products innovation, DNA, customer growth. We see real leverage in doing that. So John talked about that. Go ahead, John. John Gamble : Absolutely. Look, Manav, I'm not going to size them specifically, right? But we referenced them because they're all meaningful to us, right? So they're all impacting margins. But again, 200 basis points increase in a market where there's 600 basis points of headwinds from mortgage and then obviously UC and ERC, which is we think is a very good outcome. So we think we're delivering substantial savings from reduction in transformation. And as we indicated, we will start delivering savings on net -- sorry, net cloud relative to decom and other cost savings. So we feel good about the direction we're headed, and we feel good about delivering 200 basis points of growth. Manav Patnaik : Got it. Okay. And then maybe just some modeling items, just so that we get the directional numbers right. Could you just give us what the 2021 EC and UC revenues were so that we can model that 30% decline? And then the same thing, I guess, the D&A, interest expense and CapEx, please? John Gamble : For the third quarter? I think we gave it in the script. I think we... Manav Patnaik : No, for 2021, like what is the number? Just so that we can do the 2022 modeling, you gave us some changes. John Gamble : So I understand the question. So we'll think about that. Obviously, we're going to be together again in a little over 2 weeks, and perhaps we can provide a bridge. But we gave -- I think we gave details on a 30% reduction. We said the 30% reduction was 1.25% of revenue. so I think between those 2 numbers, you'll get pretty close to the exact number, but we haven't disclosed it yet. But -- and I apologize, I don't have it at my fingertips. But I think with those 2 pieces of information, you can get really close to the UC and ERC revenue in '21 and 2022. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital. Ashish Sabadra : Two questions. First one is on pricing. You obviously have a very strong pricing power, and there were some pretty good pricing increases in the verification business. How do we think about pricing increases going forward? And then just second one, on the $50 million of investment, how do we think about that investment? I know you talked a lot about it. But is this like a onetime investment? Or should we think about having this like $50 million investment every year over the next several years? So color on both fronts. Mark Begor : Yes. And so on the investment one, we will continue to balance as we have, since I've been here, balance growing our margins while investing in the business. And the $50 million that was referenced is areas where we see opportunities to continue to grow our investments in new products and DNA in order to drive our top line, and that's really around leveraging the cloud. I'll leave the long-term discussion until a couple of weeks on November 10 during Investor Day, where we can talk in more detail about that balance. But we've been very clear that we expect our margin -- we expect to expand our margins going forward while investing in Equifax. And there'll be a balance there that we think is the right thing for Equifax and for our shareholders over the long term. John, do you want to take the first question? Your first question was around verification revenue, and you want... Ashish Sabadra : That's right, the pricing power. Mark Begor : Pricing, yes, yes. The pricing is one lever that we use across Equifax. Workforce clearly has more pricing power than our other businesses. And we expect to have price be a positive for us in 2022, and that's inside our early framework. And of course, we've got many, many other levers that we focus even more strongly on. New products is a big one in verification. Of course, the number of polls penetration, those will all drive the business and, of course, records underlie driving verification. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Craig Huber : Maybe if you could touch on your personal finance area and the credit cards area within your traditional credit bureau business. How did that do in the quarter? What's your near-term outlook for that, please? Mark Begor : Yes. I don't think we gave any real specific details on it. I can give you some color is that as we expected coming out of COVID, we expected cards and P loans to see some positive momentum, which we have, particularly around marketing. As you know, the card issuers and P loan issuers in 2020 really stopped a lot of the marketing because of the uncertainty around where the consumer was going to be. And now as you got into 2021 and certainly through the third quarter, we've seen an increase in marketing. You've seen that in our numbers. A lot of our marketing performance in USIS is from cards and some from P loans. And we expect to see issuers continue to try to acquire more customers and build up their balance sheets, which have come down as consumers have been paying down a lot of balances. So there's quite a bit of marketing activity going on, and we expect that to continue in the future. John Gamble : The bulk of our -- the bulk of that business for us, obviously, is in banking and lending. And Mark talked about the growth we're seeing in banking in the third quarter and second quarter, right? So we've seen double-digit growth both quarters. Craig Huber : I appreciate that. My follow-up question on the Global Consumer Solutions area, maybe just touch on your outlook there, the next couple of quarters, if you could, in the direct versus the indirect side. I think you just sort of touched on a little bit right there but just go a little further detail on that. Mark Begor : Yes. I think we talked in our comments that we expect the partner business to return to growth in the fourth quarter. It was clearly impacted by the tightening of originations by a lot of their customers, and on the direct business, we expect the same. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Gary Bisbee with Bank of America. Gary Bisbee : I wanted to go back to records growth for a minute, and you've had tremendous success with the payroll channel. And it sounds like you've got maybe at this point, the three major players. I know there's some reasonably chunky players after that, but then it fragments my understanding pretty quickly. Is that enough to continue to deliver double-digit records growth? And I guess, how meaningful at the moment or over the next 12 to 24 months or some of these other opportunities like the 1099 workers or pensions? And are there other sort of types of players beyond payroll that have data that could further -- you could do deals with to further support growth of records? Look, we get why it's been unbelievable. I guess I'm just not certain if payroll being a big piece of that can drive the next few years like it has the last few. Mark Begor : So Gary, as we've talked about, we get the bulk of our records through our Employer Services business, and that's a steady increase in records, and 60% of our records come from that. So that's clearly a base area of focus where we have a dedicated team on the partnership side. They can be a little bit lumpy when you bring in a larger payroll processor. But there's still a lot of runway in that vertical, if you want to call it that, of continuing to expand those partnerships. And as we said, we've got continued momentum there and very active dialogues about them wanting to join. Another area for records is around HR software partnerships where they have access to records because of the software being embedded in an individual company. Both companies, as you know, process their own payroll. Some use their own systems, but most use some third-party systems. So that's another avenue for us in order to access records. And then we talked about our focus on gig and pension to go even further as far as our record addition. So we see a lot of runway in our ability to continue to grow records, which is, as you know, is a very valuable lever for top and bottom line growth at Workforce Solutions. Gary Bisbee : And then just one more on that topic. You mentioned new products a lot. And I know a few times in the past, you've talked about substantially higher-priced products like $100, $150, $200 versus $10 and $20 or whatever the typical. But can you give us just maybe an example of one that is in the market driving revenue, what the price point is or what is unique about the new offering versus the traditional levels of income and employment? I just would love... Mark Begor : Yes, sure. There's a bunch of them. I'll give you a couple in mortgage. In mortgage, our typical solution is a report that shows current income and employment, and it verifies that. And that might sell for $20 to $40, somewhere in that range. And as you know, because we have the 0.5 billion of historical records, in some mortgage applications, the complexity of the consumers' income, let's say, that they've changed jobs recently, so they don't have a lot of job history. Or let's say, that they get a lot of incentive-based income, he's either a salesperson or some other incentive-based income, meaning it's lumpy when the income comes in. They get it at the end of the year. And many of those solutions, you require more history. So we have it. So instead of selling that, call it, $20 to $40 solution, we'll sell a solution that has 24 months or 36 months or even 48 months, all different products, and those price points are in the $100, $150, $200 range, meaning substantially higher, and again, leveraging our historical data. Another mortgage solution is Mortgage Duo, which we rolled out in the last couple of months. Some mortgage applications have 2 income owners on it, a husband and wife using that example. And in the old solution, and it's still used, the originator would pull on the husband for $20 to $40 and then on the wife for $20 to $40 using that kind of a couple. We have a solution now that's priced between, I think, $175 and $200. It provides both reports at the same time. It also allows, I think, in that solution, a second poll somewhere in the mortgage application process. So substantially above the price point and again, delivering value to the originator because they're looking for speed and looking to complete it quickly. That's really the solution there. Turning to I-9, we've got an I-9 solution that typically, John, the I-9 traditional is in the $10 to $20 range? John Gamble : More like $30 to $40. Mark Begor : $30 to $40. John Gamble : I-9, sorry, you're right, $10 to $20. Mark Begor : $10 to $20 range is I-9, and we've got a new solution we've talked about the last couple of quarters that we rolled out that's an I-9 anywhere that allows the applicant to complete it on an Equifax app, the I-9 process, and then go verify it at a couple of thousand different sites across the United States that we do through our partnership. And that solution instead of being in, call it, that $10 range is in the $75 to $100 range, providing real value. Now the value is to that applicant and the employer to speed up the I-9 process so that individual can get on the job, on the floor, in the factory, in the restaurant. So a couple of different solutions in talent, same thing. We're starting to have solutions instead of just pulling a where does Mark work now solution, having more history because some employers want that. Some employers want where is Mark working now or the job that he's leaving. They want to verify that. Others will want to verify employment for the last 2 or 3 or 4 jobs. And as we mentioned earlier, we're going to be productizing a more comprehensive solutions that combine not only work history from our TWN database to 0.5 billion records that we have or the average 4.5 jobs on the average American. That work history, we're going to be adding to it incarceration data from Appriss, medical licensing and credentialing data from Appriss, university, secondary education college degrees from National Student Clearinghouse. Those will all be productized in a solution that will deliver more value, deliver more speed and at a higher price point than the individual solutions because of the value that it adds in speeding up that process. So those are all some examples of where we're focused on. And these are all driven by the new Equifax Cloud. These are things that would have been very challenging to do with the pace that we're doing it. In this case, we're talking mostly about Workforce Solutions, but the same across Equifax. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Dorian Hare for any closing remarks. Dorian Hare : Thank you for joining today's call. Looking forward to joining you again for a robust discussion when we have our Investor Day on November 10. Once again, the registration is currently open, and there is a link to the Slide 24 where you can register for our Investor Day. We'll also be releasing a press release later today with those details. This does conclude the call. Operator : Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a great day.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Dorian Hare, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Dorian Hare : Thanks and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Dorian Hare. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the IR Calendar section of the News and Events tab at our IR website, www.investor.equifax.com. During today's call, we will be making reference to certain materials that can also be found in the Presentations section of the News and Events tab at our IR website. These materials are labeled Q4 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Also, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including first quarter and full year 2022 guidance to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors that may impact our business are set forth in our filings with the SEC, including our 2020 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. We will also be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax, adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and can be found in the Financial Results section of the Financial Info tab at our IR website. In 4Q 2021, Equifax incurred a restructuring charge of $8.6 million or $0.05 a share. This charge was for COGS principally incurred to reduce technology development expense as we complete the Equifax data and cloud transformation. This restructuring charge is excluded from adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income and adjusted EPS. As we have previously discussed, in July 2019, we entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the U.S. consumer class action litigation arising out of the 2017 cybersecurity incident. That settlement agreement has been the subject of numerous court appeals. On January 10, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the last remaining petitions seeking to appeal, and the settlement agreement became effective as of January 11, 2022. In January, we deposited the remaining $345 million into the consumer restitution fund, and the claims administrator will begin to validate consumer claims. As a result, in the fourth quarter, we eliminated \u2013 excuse me, as a reminder, in the fourth quarter, we eliminated our GCS operational segment and moved its lines of the business into Workforce Solutions, USIS and International in Canada and Europe. As a result, Equifax now has three operating segments. In our remarks today, we will discuss 2021 and fourth quarter results as well as our 2022 guidance focused on this new structure, unless we indicate otherwise. For your reference, we have included in our 4Q 2021 earnings release Q&A reconciliations of our 2020 and 2021 prior business unit operating segment results to this new structure. Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark. Mark Begor : Thanks, Dorian, and good morning. Before I get to our strong fourth quarter results, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the tremendous progress and outstanding results we delivered last year. As shown on Slide 4, our financial performance in 2021 was very strong and built off an equally strong 2020. Revenue was up 19% with organic local currency revenue growth of 15% and core non-market growth of 22%, all well above our new 8% to 12% long-term financial framework, reflecting the strength of the new Equifax growth model. Adjusted EPS at $7.64 was up 10% and adjusted for the change in treatment of transformation expenses in 2021 was up a strong 24%. This is truly an outstanding year, substantially stronger than we expected when we started 2021 and despite a U.S. mortgage market that was down more than we expected at 7.5%. We delivered eight consecutive quarters of double-digit growth and 2 years of strong above-market performance with 17% growth in 2020 and 19% growth last year. Workforce Solutions delivered a milestone with revenue over $2 billion for the first time, up 39% with organic revenue growth of 34% and the business is up 2x from their 2019 revenue of $915 million. This was again driven by very strong performance in Verification Services with revenue up 46% and organic revenue growth of 41%. Active records on the work number grew by a very strong 22 million records or 19% to 136 million records at the end of the year. Mortgage revenue was up 41%, almost 50 percentage points stronger than the underlying market. And non-mortgage revenue in Verification Services had organic growth of 41% driven by talent solutions with organic growth of over 100%. USIS also had a strong year. Non-mortgage revenue was up 16% with organic growth of 10%. Total revenue was up 4% with organic revenue growth of 2% despite the 7.5% decline in the U.S. mortgage market. In total, our U.S. businesses of Workforce Solutions and USIS, which together represent almost 80% of Equifax revenue, delivered 20% total and 17% organic growth with non-mortgage revenue growth of over 21% total and 15% organic, again, all well above our new long-term framework of 8% to 12%. International also delivered a milestone in 2021 with their first year of revenues over $1 billion. Revenue grew 10% in local currency driven by double-digit growth in Asia Pacific, Canada and Latin America. In 2021, Equifax core revenue growth, the green section of the bars on Slide 5, grew a very strong 22% with fourth quarter revenue growth also a very strong 18%, both substantially above the new 8% to 12% long-term growth framework. Core organic revenue growth in 2021 was 18% and 13% in the fourth quarter, again, above our long-term framework. Non-mortgage organic growth in Workforce Solutions and USIS and growth in International drove almost 9% core organic revenue growth in 2021 and over 8% in the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of acquisitions and FX. Mortgage outperformance, primarily in EWS, drove the remaining 9% in 2021 and 5% in fourth quarter, respectively, of core organic revenue growth. As we move through 2022 and 2023, we expect to see continued strong and balanced core growth, reflecting the benefits of the \u2013 from the strength of Workforce Solutions, the new Equifax Cloud and accelerated NPIs. And we expect continued strong non-mortgage performance from both organic growth and acquisitions as well as continued strong mortgage outperformance from Workforce Solutions. Slide 6 covers our strong fourth quarter performance. Revenue at $1.25 billion was up 12% with organic constant currency growth of 6.6% despite a decline in the U.S. mortgage market of 21%, which was off a strong 23% growth a year ago in the fourth quarter. As I discussed earlier, core revenue growth was a very strong 18% in the quarter with core organic growth of 13% again driven by outstanding performance at Workforce Solutions. Fourth quarter Equifax adjusted EBITDA totaled $403 million, slightly higher than expected. EBITDA margins of 32.2% were consistent with our expectations. The decline in margins versus last year was primarily due to the inclusion of cloud technology transformation costs of $47 million in our adjusted results in the fourth quarter, which were excluded last year. Adjusting for these costs, our margins were 35.9%. John will provide more \u2013 a more detailed discussion on our 2022 margins in a few minutes and the drivers of our up to 200 basis point margin expansion in 2022 that we're targeting. Adjusted EPS of $1.84 per share was above the high-end of our guidance range. As expected, adjusted EPS was down from last year and reflected the inclusion of cloud transformation costs of $47 million or $0.30 a share in our adjusted results in the quarter, which were excluded last year. Excluding these costs, adjusted EPS would have been up 7.1%, about consistent with our organic revenue growth. The acquisitions completed in 2021 were slightly accretive to adjusted EPS. And we expect substantial acceleration and accretion in 2022 and 2023 from the acquisitions as we complete the integrations. Workforce Solutions had another exceptional quarter, delivering revenue of $532 million with reported revenue growth of 29% and organic revenue growth of 17%. And this, of course, was delivered despite the 21% decline in the mortgage market in the fourth quarter and against very strong 61% revenue growth that they delivered last year in the fourth quarter. Non-mortgage revenue was up almost 50% with organic non-mortgage revenue up about 25%. Included in Workforce Solutions fourth quarter results is about $7 million from ID Watchdog, which was previously a part of GCS and is now part of Employer Services business in EWS. The strength of EWS and uniqueness and value of their twin income and employment data was clear again in the fourth quarter. EWS is clearly our fastest-growing business and powering our results. Verification Services revenue in the quarter was $427 million, up 29%, with organic growth of almost 17%. The revenue from our Appriss Insights acquisition is included in Verification Services. Verification Services mortgage revenue grew 6% in the quarter despite the 21% decline in the mortgage market with the Workforce Solutions outperformance driven by increased records, penetration and new products. Verification Services nonmortgage revenue represented just over half of total Verification Services revenue in the quarter. Total Verifier non-mortgage revenue was up almost 65%, reflecting strong 30% organic revenue growth plus the addition of Appriss Insights in October. Non-mortgage organic revenue growth of 30% was very strong, particularly over last year's fourth quarter, which was up 15%. Our government vertical with the addition of Appriss Insights provides a broad set of solutions to federal, state and local governments. These include solutions in support of government assistance programs, including food and rental support as well as the VINE victims notification service and other law enforcement solutions acquired as a part of Appriss Insights. The government vertical represented about 40% of total non-mortgage verification revenue in the quarter and delivered 25% total and over 15% organic revenue growth. Organic growth was driven by the continued growth in the work number and the continued expansion of state benefit programs. We also continue to see a ramp in volume from our new Social Security Administration contract that went live last quarter. And we expect to see significant growth in volume as we move towards run rate levels through 2022. Talent solutions, which provides income, employment, educational background and medical certification verifications, incarceration, criminal background, medical sanctions and other information for the hiring and onboarding processes through our EWS Data Hub, had another outstanding quarter. The addition of Appriss Insights in October, educational information from the National Student Clearinghouse in August and significant growth in the work number during the quarter, substantially expanded the EWS Data Hub, supporting continued customer expansion and new products. Total talent solutions revenue represented about 40% of Verifier nonmortgage revenue in the quarter with total growth of almost 100% and organic growth of 50%. As you know, over 75 million people change jobs in the U.S. annually with the vast majority having some level of screening as a part of that hiring process. We've seen both the number and the frequency of job changes increasing in the current environment. Our ongoing addition of new data assets to the EWS Data Hub will enhance new product growth in this important vertical in the future. The nonmortgage consumer lending business, principally in banking and auto, showed strong growth as well, up over 50% in the quarter. Debt management with nonmortgage consumer lending grew over 30% in the quarter. Employer Services revenue of $105 million was up 28% in the quarter. And as you know, this is an important growth engine for Workforce Solutions that also delivers new twin records. Combined, our unemployment claims and employee retention credit businesses had revenue of about $54 million, up slightly from last year but down over 15% sequentially as we expected. Substantial declines in UC revenue in the quarter were offset by growth in ERC revenue, which, as a reminder, is our business that supports employers obtaining federal employee retention credits. Employer Services non-UC and non-ERC businesses had revenue of about $50 million, up 60% versus last year with organic revenue growth of about 35%. Our I-9 business, driven by our new I-9 Anywhere solution, continued to show very strong growth, up over 50%. In the fourth quarter, our I-9 business made up about 40% of Employer Services non-UC and ERC revenue. In August, we acquired Health e(fx), which provides services to employers to help them ensure compliance with the Affordable Care Act, which we are now combining with our existing workforce analytics business. This combined workforce analytics business represented about 25% of employer non-UC and ERC revenue in the quarter. Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margins were 54.6% for 2021 and have been consistently in the mid-50s over the past two years. As John will discuss later, we expect Workforce Solutions margins to be at or above the 54.6% delivered in 2021 in both the first quarter and in 2022. As we expected, fourth quarter 2021 EBITDA margins in Workforce were 48.4% and were lower than our historic levels due to three factors. First, Appriss Insights and Health e(fx) negatively impacted margins. As expected, initial margins from these acquisitions are dilutive to Workforce Solutions. As we move through 2022 and drive synergies, this dilutive impact will be mitigated. Second, in the fourth quarter, EWS ramped one major and several smaller payroll processor record contributions to our Verifier database as well as integrated other data contributors to the data hub. As we discussed in the past, in the quarters where this occurs, we incur incremental costs related to boarding and ramping the new contributors. And as we've indicated, fourth quarter saw substantial new record additions, and these in-period costs impacted margins in the quarter. And third, our cloud transformation cost negatively impacted margins by about 200 basis points. Workforce substantially completed the Verifier cloud-native migration in the fourth quarter, so these costs will decline substantially going forward. We remain confident that Workforce Solutions margins will recover in 2022 and be above the 54.6% we saw in 2021. Rudy Ploder and the EWS team delivered another outstanding year and are well positioned to deliver a very strong 2022 and continue their above-market growth. EWS is our fastest-growing and highest-margin business. USIS had revenue of $434 million, which was about flat with the fourth quarter with the mortgage market down significantly and it includes $47 million of USIS consumer revenue previously part of GCS, which was just about flat. Total USIS mortgage revenue of $126 million was down 18% in the quarter, while mortgage credit inquiries were down 21%, about consistent with the expectations we shared in October. Outperformance versus the overall market was driven by stronger growth in mortgage solutions, including growth in services. Non-mortgage non-consumer solutions revenue of $262 million grew almost 12% with organic revenue growth of almost 6%. In the fourth quarter, insurance continued to deliver double-digit growth. Commercial, and identity and fraud were up single digits and FI, auto and telco were up low to mid-single digits. And direct-to-consumer increased over 10% in the quarter. For the full year, non-mortgage non-consumer solutions revenue was up a strong 16% with organic growth in this category of about 10%. For 2021, USIS delivered double-digit organic growth across FI, insurance, identity and fraud and D2C as well as mid- to high single-digit growth in commercial and auto and telco declined slightly. Financial Marketing Services revenue, which is broadly speaking our off-line and batch business, had revenue of about $79 million, our highest quarterly revenue in history. This was up about 14% in the quarter. The strong performance was driven by marketing-related revenue, which was up over 20%. Both risk and ID, and fraud revenue were up about 10%. In 2021, marketing-related revenue, which grew more than 20% in each quarter, represented about 40% of FMS revenue, identity and fraud above 20 and risk decisioning above 30. The USIS commercial team delivered record wins, up over 25% versus last year and 5% sequentially in the fourth quarter. Their new deal pipeline remains very strong with overall pipe slightly higher than the third quarter. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 39.4% in the quarter, up over 50 basis points sequentially from third quarter. The decline from the fourth quarter in 2020 was principally driven by twofactors. First, the acquisitions of Kount and Teletrack negatively impacted margins in the period. As expected, initial margins for these acquisitions are dilutive to USIS. As we move through 2022 and drive synergies, this dilutive impact will be mitigated. And second, cloud transformation costs negatively impacted margins by almost 75 basis points. As with EWS, these costs are expected to decline as we move through 2022. In 2022, we expect USIS margins to be flat to slightly below the almost 40% level we delivered in 2021. International revenue of $288 million was up 6% and over 7.5% sequentially on a local currency basis. Included in International in the fourth quarter was almost $25 million of consumer solutions revenue in Canada and the UK that was formerly part of GCS, which was down about 6% versus last year. The lower growth in the consumer revenue in the fourth quarter was in Europe, which we expect to recover to high single-digit growth in the first quarter. Asia Pacific, which is principally our Australia business, performed very well in the quarter with revenue of $88 million, up about 9% in local currency. Australia and New Zealand consumer revenue remained flat versus last year. Our ANZ commercial business combined online and off-line revenue was up 9% in the quarter. And our HR verifications business in Australia was up a strong 37%. European revenues of $90 million were about flat in local currency in the quarter, but up over 20% sequentially. As a reminder, Europe had a very strong baseline from the fourth quarter of 2020 driven by the reactivation of debt services in the UK and large electronic notifications volume in Spain, a consequence of a change in legislation. Our European credit reporting business, which is about two thirds of European revenue, was impacted by COVID lockdowns in the UK and up about 2%. Commercial data off-line and analytics and scores saw strong double-digit growth in the quarter. And consumer credit reporting offerings grew high single digit as lockdown measures eased. Included in the UK credit reporting business was $7 million from consumer solutions. Our European debt management business revenue was up over 30% sequentially but down 5% versus a very strong fourth quarter 2020. In December, Equifax was awarded a new five-year extension of the UK government debt resolutions tender, a debt collections contract with an estimated contract value of $136 million with an incremental $90 million upside from sales of analytics and other CRA-related solutions. We've seen significant increases in debt placements from the UK government over the past several quarters that we expect should deliver strong growth in debt management revenue in the first half of 2022 for our UK business. Canada delivered revenue of $64 million in the quarter, up 6% in local currency despite a weakening Canadian mortgage market that was down 4%. Canada experienced strong growth in analytics and decisioning solutions with strong growth in fintech and traditional FI, while supply issues continue to impact their auto business. Included in Canada revenue is $16 million of consumer solutions revenue. Latin American revenues of $45 million were up a strong 15% in the quarter in local currency, which was their fourth consecutive quarter of growth. Strong new product introductions over the past three years and pricing actions continue to benefit growth across our Latin American region. International adjusted EBITDA margins at 29.9% were up 320 basis points sequentially mainly due to stronger revenue and positive mix. Margins were down year-to-year due to costs related to the cloud transformation, both the cost of redundant systems and the inclusion in our adjusted results of the technology transformation costs, which were being excluded in 2020. Excluding these costs, margins were down slightly versus last year. Turning to Slide 7, Workforce Solutions continues to deliver outstanding performance and is clearly our strongest and fastest-growing and most valuable business. As mentioned earlier, core revenue growth was up 38% in the quarter and 42% for the year with core organic revenue growth of 28% in the quarter and 38% for the full year of 2021. These strong results were driven by the uniqueness of our TWN income and employment data, the scale of the TWN database and continued expansion of new products and markets driven by outstanding consistent execution by Rudy and his team. 2021 growth of 39% is well above their 13% to 15% long-term framework, which we shared with you in November and of course, is on top of 51% delivered \u2013 growth delivered in 2020. EWS' ability to consistently and substantially outgrow their underlying markets is driven by three factors. First, growing the work number TWN database. At the end of the fourth quarter, TWN reached 136 million active records, an increase of 19% or 22 million records from a year ago and included 105 million unique individuals, which is almost 70% of U.S. nonfarm payroll. This increase in records makes our TWN database more valuable to our customers from both higher hit rates and more complete employment histories. We are now receiving records every pay period from 2.5 million companies, up from 1 million companies when we started 2021 and 27,000 contributors a short two-plus years ago. Our strong momentum continued during the fourth quarter with the signing of three new exclusive agreements with major payroll processors that we expect to implement during 2022. As a reminder, almost 55% of our records are contributed directly by employers where EWS provides comprehensive employer services like UC claims, W-2 management, I-9, WOTC, ERC, ACA and other HR and compliance solutions. Our acquisitions of HIREtech, i2verify, Health e(fx) and now Efficient Hire, which we announced earlier this week, strengthen our ability to deliver these employer services both directly and through relationships with payroll processors and HR software companies, and of course, expand our TWN database. We still have substantial room to grow our TWN income and employment database and expect to continue to add new direct contributors as well as the additional \u2013 addition of payroll processors and software partners on an exclusive basis to TWN in 2022. Beyond just the \u2013 just under 50 million nonfarm payroll records not yet in the TWN database, we've expanded our focus to data records from the 40 million to 50 million gig workers and around 30 million pension recipients in the United States marketplace to further broaden and strengthen the TWN database. You probably saw we also announced an expansion of our global footprint for Workforce Solutions with the launch of our new UK income and employment verification platform. This adds to our existing Australia, Canada and India EWS business launches outside the United States. We've got plenty of room to grow TWN. Second growth lever for Workforce Solutions is increasing average revenue per transaction through new products and pricing our existing products to value, recognizing the depth of information TWN allows us to deliver to customers. Workforce Solutions new product pipeline is rapidly expanding as our teams leverage the power of our new Equifax Cloud capabilities. And the third growth lever is by increasing penetration in the markets we serve and expanding into new markets and new verticals. For example, we continue to increase our penetration of the mortgage market. Workforce Solutions received an inquiry for over 60% of combined mortgages, up from 55% in early 2020. We have significant runway to grow penetration in the mortgage vertical. We are also in the early stages of penetrating the talent market where today, we receive inquiries in about one in 10 hires in the United States, plenty of room for growth. Growing system-to-system integration is another key growth lever in driving both increased penetration and increasing the number of pulls per transaction. During the quarter, about 76% of TWN mortgage transactions were fulfilled system to system, up over 2x from the 32% in 2019, another great growth lever for Workforce Solutions. Workforce Solutions is performing exceptionally well with attractive above-market and above-Equifax growth rates and is highly accretive margins that we expect to power workforce \u2013 power Equifax growth in the future. Slide 8 highlights core mortgage revenue growth performance of our U.S. B2B businesses, Workforce Solutions and USIS. Mortgage revenue grew 19% in 2021 in a down 7.5% market and off 80% revenue growth in 2020. Our combined U.S. B2B businesses outperformed the market \u2013 the mortgage market by 28 points in 2021 and 16 points in the fourth quarter. This was driven by Workforce Solutions as they outperformed the underlying mortgage market by 51 points for the year and 27 points in the fourth quarter. John will cover our updated mortgage market outlook in a few minutes. We've reduced our outlook \u2013 mortgage outlook for 2021 \u2013 2022 to down 21.5% versus our prior view of down 15%, reflecting the likely impact of higher interest rates. We expect to offset a large portion of that impact with stronger growth \u2013 stronger core mortgage revenue growth from EWS, from the strong TWN record additions, new products, system-to-system integrations and penetration. We now expect EWS will outperform the U.S. mortgage market by approximately 30 points, up 700 basis points from our prior view and our combined U.S. B2B businesses of USIS and EWS to outperform the U.S. mortgage market by an amount approaching 20 points, which is up 400 basis points from our prior view. 2021 was a very strong year for new product innovation and a key priority of our team. As shown on Slide 9, we delivered a record 151 new products, up from 134 last year \u2013 I'm sorry, in 2020 and a Vitality Index of just under 9%, which is our highest vitality that we've achieved since 2018 and stronger than our 8% expectations when we started 2021. Our pace accelerated in the fourth quarter as we delivered 36 new products, positioning us well for 2022. In the fourth quarter, we launched significant new products we expect to drive growth in 2022 and beyond. The EWS talent report education product provides all available postsecondary degrees instantly sourced from the National Student Clearinghouse via an exclusive Equifax ordering experience using a single SSN number input. This enhanced offering helps deliver a more efficient hiring process and the ability to make better informed hiring decisions with a holistic candidate view. Workforce Solutions' priority next-day VOE and priority two-day VOE products are our quick and seamless manual solutions that deliver verification of employment on the next business day or second business day following a client's request. These solutions are available to both our web and integrated clients and provide complete coverage when combined with our instant verification of employment solutions from TWN. The myEquifax Allow Access product, launched by USIS, allows consumers to be notified instantly when they submit an application to a participating lender that their file is frozen and with a few easy steps can unlock their files so their loan can be processed. And this is a win-win for both the lender and the consumer. The Spending Power and Affluence Index products, also launched by US, were introduced as new marketing targeting tools that utilize proprietary data to identify customers and prospects with the greatest capacity to spend on new products or services. Spending Power estimates dollars available to spend after accounting for cost of living expenses while the Affluence Index provides a score that differentiates households based on spending power and credit utilization. And then last, we continue to help our clients automate smarter digital customer acquisition decisions by enabling access to new data sources through the ID Matrix Enhancements in Australia, our clients can simultaneously identify previously undetected risk based on e-mail metadata and assess financial eligibility for a loan based on Australian residency status. Leveraging our new Equifax Cloud capability to drive new product rollouts, we expect to deliver a Vitality Index in 2022 of over 10%, which equates to over $500 million of revenue in 2022 from new products introduced in the past three years. The 10% vitality is up over 100 basis points from our strong 2021 new product results and aligns with our new long-term growth framework we provided at our Investor Day in November. Turning to Slide 10. USIS is leading the industry in offering flexible structure for BNPL providers to report consumer credit data onto the Equifax U.S. credit exchange through BNPL-specific business industry codes. This new capability will provide Equifax customers and partners the flexibility to include the fast-growing BNPL data in credit decisioning or to exclude it based on their specific needs. Our new Equifax Cloud gives us the ability to quickly ingest and manage diverse data types and develop customer reports through Equifax One and custom scores using Equifax decisioning. Our data ingestion process is simplified by the new Equifax Cloud, and time to market for products has substantially accelerated. As we move through 2022, you'll see this capability further accelerate our NPI-based revenue growth. Before I turn it over to John, I wanted to quickly discuss our guidance expectations for 2022. In October, we shared with you a framework for 2022 that included a midpoint revenue of $5.3 billion and adjusted EPS of $8.65 per share. As discussed earlier, several factors have impacted our view of 2022 compared to the framework we shared with you a few months ago. First, expectations for the U.S. mortgage market have changed meaningfully given the jump in the 30-year mortgage rates from 3% in September to 3.6% today. We now expect the U.S. mortgage market to decline 21.5% in 2022 as opposed to the 15% decline we expected back in October. On its own, the 650 basis point further decline in the mortgage market negatively impacts our revenue by over $100 million. And offsetting that, we expect Equifax core revenue growth should reach 16% in 2022, over 200 basis points higher than what we reviewed with you in October. This is principally driven by the strong outperformance from Workforce Solutions, including the accelerated pace of new TWN record additions and the faster new products rollouts. This higher core revenue growth drives just over $100 million of additional revenue, offsetting the impact of the additional 650 basis points of mortgage market decline. Our strong core growth allows us to hold our 2022 guidance at the same level as the 2022 framework we shared with you in October with our expectation that we will be at the midpoint of our 2022 guidance for revenue of $5.3 billion and adjusted EPS of $8.65 per share. Now I\u2019d like to turn it over to John to provide more detail on our 2022 guidance and assumptions and also provide our guidance for the first quarter. We\u2019re starting off strong in 2022, given our momentum from the fourth quarter. John Gamble : Thanks, Mark. Before we discuss 2022, I\u2019ll share a little more detail on 4Q 2021. In 4Q 2021, items below operating income, specifically net interest and other expenses and effective tax rate, came in combined slightly weaker than expected. Net interest and other expense was slightly weaker than we expected, and our 22% effective tax rate was very close to the guidance we provided. As Mark referenced earlier, Equifax EBITDA margins came in as expected in the fourth quarter at 32.2%. The factors resulting in the year-to-year decline were considered in the guidance we shared in October. Specifically, two-thirds of the decline was driven by the treatment of cloud technology transformation costs in 2021, including them in our adjusted results. Remaining one-third of the decline is driven by the items Mark discussed earlier, specifically the impact on Workforce Solutions and USIS of the acquisitions completed in 2021 and the increased royalty costs. As Mark discussed, regarding the acquisitions, we expect to deliver synergies that will support higher EBITDA margins as we move through 2022 and 2023. And the higher royalties at Workforce Solutions were partially driven by cost related to the start-up of the significant new payroll partners launched in the second half of 2021. As I will discuss in detail in a moment, we expect 1Q 2022 Workforce Solutions margins to return to exceed 55% and overall, Equifax EBITDA margins to return to approach 35.5%, up about 325 basis points sequentially. Let\u2019s start with more detail on our assumptions for the U.S. mortgage market. As shown on Slide 11, in 2022, we are expecting a 21.5% year-to-year decline in the U.S. mortgage market credit inquiries. With a more rapid increase in the U.S. mortgage market rates we have seen in the first quarter, reaching 3.6% last week, consistent with the increase in the U.S. 10-year and reduced Fed purchasing of mortgage-backed securities, we expect refinancing activity to drop more substantially beginning as early as late in the first quarter. 2022 U.S. mortgage market credit inquiries would need to decline an additional just under 5% from 2021 levels to return to average levels we saw over the 2015 to 2019 period. The left side of Slide 12 provides perspective on the number of home mortgages for which a refinancing would be beneficial. We have expanded this chart from versions we shared in prior quarters to provide greater perspective on the full in-the-money population of mortgages. As we\u2019ve discussed in prior quarters, in rising mortgage rate environments, refinancings will often occur with lower levels of rate benefit. This is increasingly true during periods of high home price appreciation as homeowners look to borrow against their increasing levels of home equity. Looking at data from late January, at current mortgage rate levels, there are over 16 million homes that would benefit from a refinancing. Of this amount, about 7.8 million mortgages that have a loan to value at 80% or below and for which the borrower has a 660 or above credit score would see their mortgage rate decline by 75 basis points or more. There\u2019s an additional 5.3 million that have an LTV of 70% or below that would see their mortgage rate decline by 25 basis points to 75 basis points. And there are another just over 3 million that have an LTV of 70% or below that would benefit by up to 25 basis points from refinancing. Although down significantly from the levels we saw earlier in 2021 when mortgage rates were around 3%, this remains a significant population similar to the levels we saw in 2009 and about 15% below what we saw in 2016. For perspective, per Black Knight data during 4Q 2021, over 35% of refinancings were by borrowers benefiting by a rate decrease of less than 75 basis points. Based upon our most recent data from July 2021, mortgage refinancings were just about 600,000 per month. As shown on the right side of Slide 12, the pace of existing home purchases continues at historically very high levels. Our 2022 assumption for U.S. mortgage credit inquiries is that we will see these high levels of purchase mortgage financings continue at levels slightly above the levels we saw in 2021. And that refinancings will decline significantly from the levels we saw in both 2020 and 2021. Slide 13 provides a revenue walk detailing the drivers of the 8.4% constant currency and 7.6% total revenue growth to the midpoint of our 2022 revenue guidance of $5.3 billion. Using current FX rates, FX is a negative impact on 2022 growth of just over 0.8%, about 0.2 percentage points weaker than we discussed in October. Total revenue of $5.3 billion is up almost 8% from 2021 and in line with the framework we provided in October. The 21.5% more \u2013 decline in the U.S. mortgage market is negatively impacting 2022 growth by about 6.6%, about 200 basis points or just over $100 million more negative than the levels we discussed in October. When combined with the expected declines in the Workforce Solutions unemployment claims and ERC business, total headwinds to 2022 revenue growth are about 8 percentage points. Core organic revenue growth on a constant currency basis is anticipated to be over 13%. This is almost 200 basis points higher than we discussed in October with this improvement driven by Workforce Solutions through the much stronger record growth and accelerating NPI and strong pricing driving higher average unit revenues that Mark discussed earlier. Non-mortgage organic growth is driving over 7% of the growth. The largest contributor continues to be Workforce Solutions with strong organic growth in talent solutions, government and employee boarding solutions, including I-9. USIS non-mortgage and international are also expected to drive core growth. Mortgage revenue outperformance relative to the overall mortgage market is expected to drive the remaining almost 6% of the core \u2013 of the organic core growth. This is driven by strong outperformance in Workforce Solutions. The acquisitions completed in 2021, plus the Efficient Hire acquisition closed earlier this week, are expected to contribute about 3.2 percentage points of growth to 2022. Core revenue growth, excluding FX, of almost 16.5% is well above our long-term framework and 200 basis points higher than we discussed in October due to the stronger core organic growth in Workforce Solutions and our good start to the year and acquisitions. This stronger core revenue growth drives just over $100 million in revenue benefit, offsetting the impact of the weaker mortgage market. Slide 14 provides an adjusted EPS walk detailing the drivers of the expected 13% growth to the midpoint of our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance of $8.65 per share. This is in line with the midpoint of the 2022 framework we shared in October. EBITDA margins are still expected to increase in the 175 to 200 basis point range we discussed in October. Revenue growth of 7.6% at our 2022 EBITDA margins of about 33.9% would deliver about 10% growth in adjusted EPS. EBITDA margin expansion of 175 basis points to 200 basis points is expected to drive 9% growth in adjusted EPS. Depreciation and amortization is expected to increase by about $40 million in 2022, which will negatively impact adjusted EPS by about 3%. D&A is increasing in 2022 as we accelerate putting cloud-native systems into production. The combined increase in interest expense and tax expense in 2022 is expected to negatively impact adjusted EPS by about 3 percentage points. The increase in interest expense reflects increased debt from the 2021 acquisitions and the higher short-term interest rates I\u2019ve referenced. Interest rates \u2013 the interest expense is higher than our expectation in October by about $7 million. Our estimated tax rate used in this framework of 24.5% does not assume any changes to the U.S. federal tax rate. Slide 15 provides a view of Equifax total and core revenue growth from 2017 through 2022. We anticipate delivering strong core revenue growth of 16%, reflecting organic growth of 13% and a 3% benefit from acquisitions completed in 2021 plus Efficient Hire. Slide 16 provides the specifics on our 2022 full year guidance. 2022 revenue of between $5.25 billion and $5.35 billion reflects growth of about 6.6% to 8.7% versus 2021, including a 0.8% negative impact from FX. Acquisitions are expected to positively impact revenue by 3.2%. EWS is expected to deliver over 15% revenue growth with continued very strong growth in Verification Services. EWS EBITDA margins are expected to be up from the 54.6% delivered in 2021. USIS revenue is expected to be about flat, reflecting the 21.5% assumed decline in the U.S. mortgage market. Non-mortgage revenue is expected to be up 6% to 8%. USIS EBITDA margins are expected to be slightly down from the 39.9% delivered in 2021. Combined EWS and USIS mortgage revenue is expected to be down slightly with mortgage outperformance approaching 20%. And International revenues expected to deliver constant currency growth of about 7% to 9%. International EBITDA margins are expected to expand by over 175 basis points. 2022 adjusted EPS of $8.50 to $8.80 per share is up 11.2% to 15.2% from 2021. Given the greater decline of the U.S. mortgage market we discussed earlier, we believe that our guidance is centered at the midpoint of both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges. The 175 to 200 basis point improvement in our 2022 EBITDA margin from the 33.9% in 2021 is principally driven by the following main factors. Workforce Solutions revenue growth of over 15% with margins at or above their current 54.6% drives a benefit to overall Equifax EBITDA margins of over 150 basis points. Corporate expense as a percentage of revenue is declining year-to-year on higher overall Equifax revenue, improving overall Equifax EBITDA margin by on the order of 100 basis points. The drivers of the lower spend are principally lower corporate technology transformation expense and lower variable comp. International margin expansion of over 175 basis points also drives about 25 basis points in overall Equifax EBITDA margin. These are partially offset by the negative impact on overall Equifax EBITDA margins of flat USIS revenue in 2022 due to the very weak mortgage market. Slide 17 provides our guidance for 1Q 2022. We are starting 2022 strong, better than previously expected. We expect revenue in the range of $1.32 billion to $1.34 billion, reflecting revenue growth of about 8.8% to 10.5%, including a 1.2% negative impact from FX. The U.S. mortgage market as measured by credit inquiries is expected to be down approximately 24%. Acquisitions are expected to positively impact revenue by about 5.2%. 1Q 2022 EBITDA margins are expected to approach 35.5%, up about 325 basis points sequentially. The improvement is driven by the same two factors we discussed driving the improvement in our full year 2022 EBITDA margins. Looking at the business units in the first quarter, Workforce Solutions revenue is expected to be up over 25% year-to-year, and EBITDA margins are expected to be over 55% driven by significant growth in Verifier and seasonally strong Workforce Analytics revenue. Workforce Solutions will represent about 47% of Equifax revenue in the quarter. USIS revenues expected to be down 3% to 4% year-to-year driven by the 24% decline in the U.S. mortgage market. The mortgage decline is partially offset by growth in non-mortgage expected to be up mid-single-digit percentage. EBITDA margins will be down slightly sequentially from 4Q 2021 due to the weak mortgage market. International revenue is expected to be up about 8% year-to-year in constant currency. And EBITDA margins are expected to be down about 100 basis points year-to-year. The decline in EBITDA margin is driven by increased cost in Canada as we migrate our Canadian credit exchange to be in production on data fabric in the quarter and some negative mix from growth in debt management. As I just indicated, full year EBITDA margins for International should increase 175 basis points year-to-year. Corporate expense will decline year-to-year, benefiting overall Equifax EBITDA margins. We are expecting adjusted EPS in 1Q 2022 to be $2.08 to $2.18 per share compared to the 1Q 2021 adjusted EPS of $1.97 per share. Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 18. At our Investor Day in November, we discussed the strong earnings and cash flow that can be generated by 2025 by Equifax executing our new long-term financial framework. We also shared a scenario for you to consider that assuming the U.S. mortgage market normalizes by 2025 to the average levels we saw over 2015 to 2019 and we deliver revenue growth just above the midpoint of our 8% to 12% framework growth rate, revenue in 2025 could be about $7 billion. And continuing to execute our cloud data and tech transformation at these revenue levels could deliver 39% EBITDA margins by 2025. Beyond 2025, we expect to see revenue expansion of 8% to 12% and deliver margin expansion of, on average, 50 basis points per year, reflecting our significant operating leverage and high variable margins. As shown on Slide 19, free cash flow accelerated significantly in 2021, reaching $866 million and 92% of adjusted net income. In 2022, excluding the $345 million payment on the U.S. consumer class action settlement made in January, free cash flow will exceed $1 billion and 95% of adjusted net income. As we discussed in November at our Investor Day, to the extent, we are able to deliver revenue growth and EBITDA margins I just referenced in 2025, we could generate $2.7 billion of EBITDA, $12.75 in adjusted EPS and $1.6 billion in free cash flow, almost double the $866 million that we delivered in 2021. The substantial increase in free cash flow creates significant capacity for M&A and also for a return of capital to shareholders through cash generation and increased debt capacity. Now I\u2019d like to turn it back to Mark. Mark Begor : Thanks, John. As highlighted on Slide 20, we remain laser-focused on our EFX2023 growth strategy to leverage the new EFX Cloud with innovation new products. EFX2023 is the foundation of our new 8% to 12% long-term growth framework and the foundation of the new Equifax. We continue to make significant progress executing the Equifax cloud data and technology transformation. We now have about half of our revenue being delivered from the new Equifax cloud. This will build meaningfully in 2022 as we expect to substantially complete our North America cloud migrations. We\u2019ve now completed almost 112,000 B2B migrations, over 10 million consumer migrations and 1 million data contributor migrations. In North America, our principal consumer exchanges are in production in the new Equifax cloud-based single data fabric and delivering to our customers. Our International transformation is also progressing and is expected to be principally complete by the end of 2023 with some customer migrations continuing into 2024. We remain on track and confident in our plan to become the only cloud-native data analytics and technology company. We\u2019re in the early days of leveraging our new EFX cloud capabilities, but remain confident that it will differentiate us commercially, expand our NPI capabilities, accelerate our top line growth and expand our margins from the growth and cost savings in 2022 and beyond. At our Investor Day in November, we discussed how the execution of our new EFX2023 strategic priorities, including the Equifax data and technology cloud transformation, will lead to stronger revenue growth, faster margin expansion and higher adjusted EPS growth. We introduced the new Equifax long-term financial framework shown on Slide 21, with total revenue growth of 8% to 12%, including 100 to 200 basis points of growth from bolt-on M&A. We also expect to deliver margin expansion, as John mentioned a few minutes ago, with 50 basis points per year over the long-term. That will help us deliver adjusted EPS growth of 12% to 16%, which combined with our 1% dividend yield target will allow us to deliver a total return to shareholders of 13% to 18% going forward. Reinvesting our strong outperformance and strategic and accretive bolt-on M&A is a key priority for the future. As shown on the left side of Slide 22, 2021 was a strong year for bolt-on M&A with eight acquisitions closed totaling about $3 billion that added $300 million to run rate revenue, excluding synergies. Our M&A priorities are clear and focused on expanding and strengthening the core of Equifax through, number one, expanding and strengthening our strongest and fastest-growing business, Workforce Solutions; number two, adding unique data assets; number three, expanding in the fast-growing $19 billion identity and fraud space; and number four, continuing to look to expand our credit bureau footprint globally. We expect to add 100, 200 basis points in revenue growth each year from bolt-on M&A. In 2021, we completed eight strategic and accretive acquisitions shown on Slide 23. We substantially strengthened and broadened Workforce Solutions through the acquisition of Appriss as well as Health e(fx), HIREtech and i2verify. And we strengthened our identity and fraud portfolio through the acquisition of Kount and our USIS differentiated data assets through both the Teletrack and Kount acquisitions. These were critical acquisitions for Equifax that we\u2019re now focused on fully integrating the businesses and driving synergies to accelerate our growth. Reinvesting our strong cash flow and accretive and strategic bolt-on M&A is central to our EFX2023 growth strategy and long-term growth framework. We\u2019re starting off 2022 \u2013 we\u2019re starting 2022 off strong with a bolt-on acquisition that we closed earlier this week. As outlined on Slide 24, Efficient Hire further strengthens Workforce Solutions by bringing expanded employer services to hospitality, building services and senior living. The acquisition also strengthens Workforce Solutions to better compete and penetrate the hourly and high-volume hiring market and provides us with incremental TWN records. Slide 25 highlights the tremendous growth of Workforce Solutions, both in revenue and EBITDA margins over the past five years. The very strong growth of the work number and the addition of Appriss Insights and expansion of the EWS Data Hub have dramatically expanded the Workforce Solutions addressable markets across new verticals of talent solutions, government, Employer Services, including onboarding as well as their core mortgage and financial services markets. Our ability to access these markets with our unique and still expanding TWN employment, income and talent data and services will allow EWS to continue to deliver above-market core growth and power EFX in the future. We\u2019re also leveraging the new EWS cloud-based tech platform for international expansion with the announcement I mentioned earlier of our new UK income and employment verification services. This adds to our EWS solutions in Canada, Australia and India. Workforce Solutions has grown from about 25% of Equifax revenue three years ago to over 40% last year and will likely grow to over 50% of Equifax in the coming years. The above-market growth in Workforce Solutions and depth and diversity of their people-based assets have moved Equifax well beyond the traditional credit bureau space and made us a faster growing and more diverse business than we were a short three years ago. As shown on Slide 26, the new Equifax is a customer and product-centric company that will deliver 8% to 12% revenue growth in the future by leveraging our Equifax cloud-native architecture centered on a single data fabric to enable seamless use of our unique data assets to deliver new products faster and more effectively. Executing on our EFX2023 growth strategy and delivering revenue growth consistent with the midpoint of our long-term framework will allow us to deliver $7 billion of revenue and 39% EBITDA margins in 2025, as John just mentioned a few minutes ago and as we shared with you in November. Wrapping up on Slide 27, Equifax delivered another strong base quarter with above-market growth in 2021, more than offsetting a declining mortgage market. We are operating exceptionally well and have strong momentum as we move into 2022. We\u2019ve now delivered eight consecutive quarters of strong above-market double-digit growth, reflecting the power of the new Equifax business model and our execution against our EFX2023 strategic priorities. Equifax is on offense. Workforce Solutions had another outstanding quarter and year, powering our results, delivering 29% revenue growth in the fourth quarter while integrating Appriss Insights and the three other 2021 bolt-on acquisitions that strengthened the core of our Workforce Solutions. Workforce is clearly our largest, fastest-growing and most valuable business. And Rudy and his team remain focused on driving outsized growth. USIS also delivered a strong quarter with 12% non-mortgage growth and about 6% organic non-mortgage growth, offsetting the impact of a sharp over 20% decline in the mortgage market. Sid and the USIS team remain competitive and are working and are winning in the marketplace. International grew for the fifth consecutive quarter with 6% growth in local currency as economies reopen and business activity resumes. We have high expectations for International as we move into 2022. We spent the last three years building the Equifax cloud and are in the early days of leveraging our new and uniquely Equifax cloud-based technology and single data fabric capabilities. As we move into 2022 and beyond, we will increasingly realize the top line, cost and cash benefits from these new only Equifax cloud capabilities. And we\u2019ve already added a strategic bolt-on acquisition to Workforce Solutions this week that combined with the acquisitions we made in 2021 are contributing 320 basis points or almost $160 million to 2022 revenue growth. We continue to build our pipeline as we look to add 100 to 120 basis points of revenue growth annually from bolt-on M&A. Our 2022 guidance with core revenue growth of 16% is well above our new 8% to 12% long-term framework. And 8% growth in total is aligned with our prior guidance despite a 21% decline in the mortgage market. Our ability to offset the additional 650 basis points of mortgage decline with stronger core growth reflects the breadth and strength of the new Equifax. Adjusted EPS is expected to be up 13% to $8.65 at the midpoint, which also aligns with the 2022 framework we reviewed with you in October. I\u2019m energized about our strong above-market performance in 2021, but even more energized about the future of the new Equifax in 2022 and beyond. We remain convinced that our new Equifax cloud-based technology, differentiated data assets in our new single data fabric and market-leading businesses will deliver higher growth, expanded margins and free cash flow in the future. I\u2019d also like to announce today that Trevor Burns is returning to the Equifax Investor Relations team. Please join me in welcoming Trevor back to IR and feel free to contact Trevor, Dorian or Sam with any questions. And with that, operator, let me open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from George Mihalos from Cowen. Your line is now live. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. This is Allison on for George. Congrats on the strong results and outlook. And thank you for taking my questions. I was hoping to drill in a bit more into the mortgage market estimate. Given how rates have been moving, I was curious if you can comment on how the 21.5% decline in mortgage market increase estimate was derived in terms of the 10-year yield in mortgage rates? And how comfortable you are with that estimate? Mark Begor : Yes. I\u2019ll start, and John, you can jump in. As you know, forecasting the mortgage market is quite challenging. The good news is we have a lot of history which we rely on, and we have a lot of data that we rely on. But I would \u2013 you make the point that it\u2019s obviously challenging. But we look at all of our data elements of the track record of new home purchases in the marketplace, the refi market. John went through some detail on the still sizable population of homes in the United States that will benefit from a refinancing. He also highlighted the significant increase in HPA or home price appreciation, which is I think 30% for most geographies across the United States. So the availability for consumers to access equity in their homes through a refinancing. Those certainly weighed in. And of course, offsetting that, as you point out, is the higher interest rates, which reduced the number of homes available for refi. So those were all the factors that we put into our models and our analysis. And we thought 21.5% was the right place, given everything we see today, obviously, down dramatically from the minus 15% we were using for really the second or the last portions of 2021 as we were looking forward to 2022. And then, of course, we\u2019re pleased that the core performance of Equifax is strong. And we can offset that with our core growth, particularly from Workforce Solutions from the momentum in the fourth quarter, the strong addition of records, which helps power their business and broadly the strong performance of Equifax. John Gamble : We also look closely at run rates. So really through January through early February, the run rates are consistent with what we\u2019ve talked about in our first quarter \u2013 the first quarter estimate down 24% wasn\u2019t changed that really materially from the estimate we gave in October. So we look closely at those run rates. We think they\u2019ve been relatively predictive. And we\u2019re also, as Mark said, we try to be very open about what we\u2019ve assumed. So that if you have a different view on mortgage, at least you\u2019ll have a very good view as to what we put into our numbers, and you can obviously act accordingly. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thank you for that. That\u2019s helpful color. And then just as a quick follow-up, shifting to EWS. How should we be thinking about pricing as a driver for 2022? Mark Begor : Yes. As you know, we don\u2019t talk about specific pricing actions, but all of our businesses use price on an annual basis to offset inflation, of course, but also reflect the value of the solutions that we\u2019re delivering. And we\u2019ve been quite clear in prior discussions with you and our other investors that Workforce Solutions has more pricing power because of the uniqueness of the assets they deliver and the scale of the database. So it\u2019s clearly one of the levers. But as you know, that\u2019s only one. They\u2019ve really ramped up their new product rollouts in the last 12 to 18 months, leveraging the cloud, particularly in the second half of 2021. And we talked about new solutions that we\u2019re bringing to market in the mortgage space, for example, where we have mortgage solutions that provide more history at a meaningfully higher price point than the single solution that we have or the co-borrower solution that we now have called Mortgage Duo that is priced over $175 per poll because it provides real value on co-borrowers. So those are examples of leverage that Workforce has. And of course, the other levers, the adding of TWN records, our TWN records being up 19%. The new relationships that we\u2019ve signed exclusively in the latter part of the year that we\u2019ll be adding to our records in 2022. As you know, because of the very large volume of inquiries that we get on a system-to-system basis or through the web, as we add new records, we\u2019re able to monetize those really instantly. So that 19% is another very meaningful lever for Workforce Solutions as we move into 2022. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live. David Togut : Thank you. Good morning. Appreciate all the helpful detail. If we start with the 136 million active work number records from Q4, add the three agreements you signed with payroll processors, you had additional work number records, how should we think about active work number records estimated for year-end 2022 and then the associated hit rate? Mark Begor : Yes. As you know, we don\u2019t give detail around kind of guidance on the records that we\u2019re adding during the year. We try to be very transparent about current period record additions. And as you know, those were added at different points if you think about 2021 during the year, so you get a year-over-year benefit in 2022 for the record. So the 19% increase will benefit the Workforce Solutions in 2022. And then, of course, these new agreements that we mentioned that we\u2019ve signed with major \u2013 some of the larger payroll processors on an exclusive basis, we\u2019ll be adding at different points during the year. It takes time to build the system integrations and to bring those into our data set. And then, of course, as you know, close to 60% of our records come from individual company relationships that we have from our Employer Services business. And that\u2019s a very active area for us to add records, which we do on a \u2013 kind of on a daily, weekly basis. Actually, John and I get a report every Friday of records that are added. And those are \u2013 we\u2019re really strengthening our ability to add records from individual companies as we build our Employer Services solutions, whether that\u2019s I-9, Work Opportunity Tax Credit, HCA, W-2. And as you know, we did three acquisitions last year that add to that space, including one this week, that grow our solutions and Employer Services business, but they also bring records. So we have a really a multisided approach and really scale focus on adding records. And just back on the payroll processors, we still have a pipeline of the relationships we don\u2019t have. We\u2019re in active dialogues with those as we\u2019ve talked about. We have real momentum. As you know, I don\u2019t know, in the last 18 months, we\u2019ve added some meaningful new relationships, including a large one in third quarter last year that we announced, I guess, a year ago on our fourth quarter call. And then we\u2019ve got the three that we added on an exclusive basis in the last few weeks that will be rolling in, in 2022. So a big focus on adding those records. And as you think about it, there\u2019s a long runway. I would encourage you to think about total records but also unique records. Remember, the 135 million is total records, but we have 105 million SSNs or unique individuals. So there\u2019s 30 million people in there that have multiple jobs. The path from 105 million to 155 million, 157 million or 158 million whatever the right number is now, nonfarm payroll, it\u2019s another 50 million plus individuals that we are focused on adding. And then, of course, we have a big focus of going beyond nonfarm payroll to really get those very valuable 40 million to 50 million gig records, meaning individuals that are self-employed. There is a second job beyond nonfarm payroll or someone who is just self-employed. And then also the 20 million to 30 million pensioner records that is another valuable source for income verification for those that are not in the workforce today. So you add those up, you\u2019re looking at something north of 100 million additional records we can add. If you think about the 105 million we have unique individuals and add that potential, we have the ability to still kind of double the TWN database, and we\u2019re focused on it. David Togut : Thanks for that. Just as a follow-up, John, for the first quarter, you\u2019re guiding Workforce Solutions revenue growth over 25%, which is well above the 15% guidance for the full year. Can you talk through the cadence of expected Workforce Solutions revenue growth throughout 2022? And what puts Q1 so far above the full year guide? John Gamble : Yes. The big \u2013 one of the biggest factors would be the fact that we did the large acquisitions in the second half of this year. So you wrap around the addition of that revenue as you get into the third quarter, but principally the fourth quarter. But overall, we expect Workforce Solutions to continue to perform extremely well and drive very high organic growth throughout the year. David Togut : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question Is coming from Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live. Kevin McVeigh : Congrats. On the Vitality Index, it seems like you\u2019re clearly outpacing that. And if I heard you right, it\u2019s about 10% in 2022. Maybe help us understand that. Is that just a function of some of the more recent product that\u2019s been brought to market or broader acceptance? Just what\u2019s driving that outperformance? Mark Begor : Yes, and yes. And I think you know, and I hope you get a sense that it\u2019s a huge priority of ours. We really ramped up our focus on new products, I\u2019d call it, two years ago when we added significant resources, meaning new people. I think as you know, we have for the first time now in the last two years a Chief Product Officer, who is on my leadership team. We\u2019re really driving, leveraging our differentiated data and the Equifax cloud. And what you\u2019re seeing is the \u2013 I would call it the early days or early innings of our ability to leverage the cloud. Of course, while we\u2019re more than halfway as far as kind of cloud complete, that will substantially accelerate in 2022, that half that is complete is starting to take hold, where what\u2019s happening is what we thought would happen is we\u2019re able to combine data assets, bring new solutions to market much more quickly. So it\u2019s a combination of resources and focus. We have a monthly deep dive, John and I with the product team around their pipeline and then the ability to leverage our new capabilities. This is why we invested in the cloud, why we invested in a single data fabric was our ability to ramp up new product introductions. And as you point out, going from 5%, 6% a couple of years ago vitality to we started last year hoping to do 8%. We ended at 9% vitality. And then as you point out, to be \u2013 have a goal in 2022 of 10%, that\u2019s $0.5 billion of new products introduced in the last three years. And we\u2019re very deliberate about how we define a new product. It has to be new-new. And we view that as a very attractive growth lever for us. As you know, new products and incremental revenue are very high incremental margins for our business. And it\u2019s inherent in our long-term framework that we rolled out in November, where we increased the low end of 100 bps and the high end 200 basis points of our total growth going forward that NPIs will be a meaningfully part \u2013 meaningful part of that. And when we talked in November, we said our long-term goal is to get to 10% vitality, and we\u2019re chasing that this year. And we \u2013 as we talked a few minutes ago, our goal is to deliver 10% vitality in 2022. Kevin McVeigh : That\u2019s great. And then just one quick follow-up. If you said this, I apologize, but what mortgage rate do you have embedded in the assumptions for 2022? John Gamble : So, I don\u2019t have a specific forecast for mortgage rates, right? What we do is, I think we have an earlier question, right? We look at the current forecasts that are out there for the 10-year. And we try to consider those in the decisions we make, right? So right now, I think if you took a look at the Bloomberg average, you\u2019d see an expectation that we\u2019re going to see the 10-year go up, say, somewhere between 35 basis points and 50 basis points. So, we make an assumption that probably you\u2019re looking at mortgage rates moving in a similar direction. To be fair, as Mark said, forecasting the mortgage market, incredibly hard and actually tying the movement in the mortgage market to the 10-year, also incredibly hard. But that\u2019s basically what we\u2019ve assumed in the practice. Kevin McVeigh : Thank you very much. Operator : Next question is coming from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Andrew Steinerman : Hi, John, I was just hoping you could provide mortgage revenues as a percentage of total revenues in the fourth quarter. And if you could give mortgage revenues again for fourth quarter for USIS and EWS as a percentage of revenues? John Gamble : So I can get \u2013 the first one I have, it\u2019s 27%. I think we did give in the script some detail on mortgage revenue for EWS and USIS, specifically. But for Equifax, fourth quarter mortgage was 27% of total revenue. And for the full year, it was 32%. And Andrew, just as an FYI, a little later today, we\u2019ll post the supplemental deck. And in that will be the updated pie charts that show revenue by segment for Equifax in each of the business units. Andrew Steinerman : Right. And I think the pie charts are annual, right? John Gamble : Yes, sir. Andrew Steinerman : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is now live. Mark Begor : Good morning, Manav. Manav Patnaik : Good morning, Mark. I just wanted to focus on \u2013 obviously, EWS is going well, et cetera, the mortgage market. Can you just talk a little bit about the USIS non-mortgage businesses and some of the trends and stuff you\u2019re seeing there? It sounds like the consumer is healthy, but just was hoping for that outlook on your end. John Gamble : Sure. I can start, and I\u2019m sure Mark will jump in, right? So, we had nonmortgage organic growth of about 6%. We had total growth of about 12%, right? I think as Mark mentioned in the script, we\u2019re seeing very good growth continues in insurance. We said up double digits, up high single digits in commercial, high single digits in identity and fraud. So again, we think very good performance. Mark Begor : Strong growth in marketing, which we translate as we go into 2022 into online. John Gamble : Absolutely, right. So with FI, obviously, we saw very strong growth, as Mark said, in FMS, which we think is going to translate into strengthening growth as we go through all of 2022. We\u2019ve also had, as Mark mentioned in his comments, really nice new business wins in USIS, a lot of that around FI. And then we\u2019ve had actually some several significant wins with larger FIs that should ramp as we go through 2022. So, we think we\u2019re going to see nice increases on organic growth as we move through 2022, both in total organic growth, but organic growth specifically to FIs. And as we look at identity and fraud, we saw really nice growth in, let\u2019s call it, our new identity and fraud products, our identity foundry and really Kount-based products. As we got into the fourth quarter, growth there was well over 20%. We are going through a little bit of a transition. We\u2019re transitioning off some of our older legacy based products under those new products. So you see some choppy growth, although up high single digit, certainly isn\u2019t bad. And \u2013 but we\u2019re seeing very good growth in the Kount-based products and the products that are based on the new identity foundry that we\u2019ve talked to you about in the past, which is all built on data fabric. So, we feel like the 6% that we talked about in organic in the fourth quarter was relatively good performance. As we indicated, it\u2019s probably going to be about similar to that in the first, but we\u2019re expecting to see nice improvement as we go through next year. Mark Begor : I\u2019ll just add, Manav, that we\u2019re also pleased with the traction we\u2019re starting to see and we have been seeing around kind of our competitive positioning with the cloud, the capabilities of the cloud that we deliver that we think differentiate Equifax. Of course, we think we have data our competitors don\u2019t have. And those discussions around competitive takeaways or competitive wins are continue to pick up momentum by Sid and his team. So, we think that\u2019s another positive going forward as they get closer to being cloud-native and fully delivering those differentiated service levels and capabilities to our customers. We think that\u2019s going to be a positive for them going forward. Manav Patnaik : Got it. And Mark, just on the International workforce expansion, the new countries that you had announced, can you just help us in terms of time line what we should be expecting? I\u2019m guessing your new tech and cloud infrastructure perhaps will help it get to a size faster than what we witnessed in the U.S.? Or should we be thinking differently? Mark Begor : No. It\u2019s \u2013 you and I talked before, and we\u2019ve talked with our investor base many times about our goal of expanding workforce globally. We paused International expansions while we were building out the tech stack, and that\u2019s now built. UK is our first move there. The technology is live. We\u2019re, I believe, close to ingesting records, meaning starting to have contributors contribute into our UK, TWN database. So that\u2019s happening as we speak. That was kind of built up over the last number of months. And as you point out, we now have the ability to go into international markets more quickly, more economically with a cloud-based technology stack. Of course, this adds to our Australian business, where we\u2019re ingesting and actually delivering solutions in the marketplace, same in Canada and same in India. And we do have a strategy to expand to other markets globally. We\u2019re \u2013 we haven\u2019t announced anything yet, but we see that as an opportunity. Maybe to close that point is that the financial impact of it is it will be de minimis in the scale of workforce and Equifax in 2022. Meaning it will be small, but we expect it to grow over time. Where it will be meaningful is going to be a couple of years probably when you think about those international expansions. But in each of those markets, what it does for our credit file business, think UK, Australia, India and Canada, is it makes them more competitive because we bring a solution now of not only the credit report in Canada or the UK, but then we can couple in, just like we\u2019re doing in the United States, an income and employment verification. So that\u2019s another positive of going into markets that we\u2019re already in. And of course, as you know, in a number of those markets like UK and Australia, we have very large market positions. So the addition of the income and employment data is positive for us. So it\u2019s clearly a part of Workforce Solutions growth strategy going forward is to U.K. is our \u2013 is the move we announced a couple of weeks ago. And we\u2019ll look for other markets to expand our workforce business into, because we believe \u2013 we view it as a global franchise, of course, which is anchored quite strongly in our very, very large U.S. business. Manav Patnaik : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Mark Begor : Hey Toni. Toni Kaplan : Good morning. Workforce margins really stepped down this quarter. Mark, you were clear on the three pieces. The acquisition dilution dissipating and cloud transfer transformation being over, that makes sense to me as to why those won\u2019t continue. But around the ramp of new contributors, that was really strong this quarter, which is a great thing. And it\u2019d be great if that continues. So I guess, how much was that record ramp impacting the margins? And next year, can you still achieve mid-50s if that ramp sort of continues to grow? I just want to make sure also that there isn\u2019t anything competitively changing that impacted. Mark Begor : No, no, no. I think we said two or three times in our earlier comments that we have clear expectations that workforce will in 2022 achieve their kind of historical margins or I think we said it or above. It\u2019s not unusual, and you followed us for some time. You may remember in, I think, third quarter of 2020, going back maybe to \u2013 was there in 2019, we also had maybe an instance like this, there\u2019s a little bit of lumpiness when you\u2019re adding a bigger payroll processor. And there\u2019s a lumpiness in some in-quarter costs to complete those integrations. Sometimes we help support partner, meaning we help pay for some of those integration costs, we have some incremental costs on our side. But you\u2019ve seen in the past that those quickly are dissipated, meaning they are onetime. And we \u2013 we\u2019ve factored into what is going to happen in as far as record additions that we can see now in 2022 in kind of the comments we had earlier around our expectation that workforce margins will kind of return to that mid-50s. John Gamble : Yes. And we indicated they\u2019ll step back to 55% in the first quarter, right? So, I mean \u2013 so we feel very good about the fact that these each of those three factors that Mark talked about, we can address, and we will address them very quickly. And they were all substantial, right? So, you can think about them all being relatively consistent in size and significant to what affected us year-on-year, but we expect to be back at 55% in the first quarter. Toni Kaplan : Okay. That\u2019s great. And my follow-up is also on workforce. I was hoping you could talk about just competition there, if anything has changed with regard to sort of more players coming in or some of your large bureau competitors are looking at this as an area that they can expand in. So can the market \u2013 is market growth going? Can that lead to you and others being successful? Or is this really going to come down to plating to retain market share? And just talk about sustainability and exclusivity and stuff like that. Mark Begor : Yes, it's a great question. We talked about it many times in prior calls. We got a lot \u2013 we have a lot of confidence in the scale of our underlying business model. And as you pointed out, there are some others that are trying to enter this space. We think it's going to be quite challenging to obtain records, start with that, think about the tens of thousands of integrations that we have. Remember, the integration of income and employment data is a separate integration from existing credit file integration. So those have to be built. But just start with records. The 19% growth that we had, the 135 million, 105 million uniques. We added a large payroll processor last year in the third quarter that was exclusive. We've added three more \u2013 we\u2019re adding three more that are all exclusive. And of course, exclusive means they're only going to work with Equifax and Workforce Solutions. So that's quite challenging. And remember, too, that the 60% of our records we've accumulated over 15 years of building up those relationships through the very large Employer Solutions business we have or providing all those services to HR managers and companies for W-2, I-9, Work Opportunity Tax Credit, HCA, et cetera, those solutions, that's a very long-term scale kind of business to build out. So while we know there are others in the space, we think our market position is quite strong, and we got a lot of confidence in maintaining that position going forward. And it really starts with the ability to build out a data set that looks like Equifax's we think that's very, very hard to do. John Gamble : The other thing I'd just add is that if you think about the markets we're addressing, our penetration in those markets still has a long way to run, right? As Mark mentioned in his comments on mortgage, which is where we're the most highly penetrated, it's still just over 60%. And when you go into talent solutions and government, and it's important to remember in both of those segments, right, it's not just current record, it's depth of records, so that's extremely important, right? History makes an extremely \u2013 is extremely important in both our government services and importantly, our talent solutions businesses. There, our penetration is, in most cases, well under 25%, right, and growing very rapidly. And the reason it's growing rapidly again is because of the depth of records we're now able to provide, which we couldn't provide two-years ago. So we think there's huge opportunity in those nonmortgage businesses to substantially grow our share. And right now, we're competing against, in many cases, pay stubs or more manual processes to collect the information. So we feel very, very good about the opportunities to grow within the market segment by basically providing instant verifications within those market segments where they're not available today. Mark Begor : Toni, maybe to add one more point on it. We hear more about competitors from these calls than we do in the marketplace, if you understand that point meaning, we hear that from our investors and so on, but we really don't see them in the marketplace. They just don't have the scale to play either on the record additions or on delivering solutions to our customers. We've been in this business for 15 years. We've invested $1 billion \u2013 actually, more than that, we're up to like $3-plus billion probably in the business since we owned it when you add M&A. And then on the technology side, think about it, we put $300 million into the business incrementally in the last three years. It's a massive investment, and you have to have real scale to be able to play at the level we're playing at. Toni Kaplan : Perfect, thanks. Congrats, and welcome back to Trevor. Mark Begor : Thanks. Operator : Thanks. Your next question is coming from Kyle Peterson from Needham Company. Your line is now live. Kyle Peterson : Hey, good morning. Thanks guys. Just one quick one for me. Just I want to see if you guys could provide a little more color and thoughts on the impact of buy now pay later now being kind of included in your credit reports. Do you think the opportunity there is more on the volume side of kind of increasing the pool of customers out there that are being scored particularly upgrading kind of thin-file customers to more kind of standard and thick file? Or do you think it's more of an opportunity to potentially have some pricing leverage down the road just as you get more data points and just more data that can be used by some of these potential lenders? Mark Begor : Yes, it's a great question. It's really all of the above. We have a relationships all over the globe with the BNPL players. As you know, they're growing rapidly. We're selling them identity data, think Kount or other identity because you got to verify a consumer before you offer that for payment loan, for the blue jeans or whatever they're buying. We're also selling them some credit data in different markets, including the United States, particularly as they go to bigger-ticket transactions. If you're financing a pair of blue jeans for $100, over four-payments, there's a credit exposure to that. It's very different than you're doing a refrigerator. That's a $1,000 refrigerator or something. And so there's a trend there where you're seeing more credit data being used for BNPL players as customers. On the data side, it really follows our focus on just building out our data assets. And there are a lot of data elements, as you point out, in BNPL players. And actually, with all credit fans, it's very popular, for example, with millennials, which typically have thinner credit files. They may be good credit, but they have thin credit files. Meaning they only have one bank card or two bank cards or whatever. So that BNPL data will be very valuable. We're also going down the path of adding rental data. So we're accumulating rental payment data. That's another valuable asset. And of course, in the alternative data side, meaning outside the credit file, we have really scaled data assets at Equifax that we're putting in our single data fabric and bringing to market as new solutions like our NCTUE cellphone utility payment data, which is very valuable as another trade line for thin or no hit \u2013 thin file or no hit customers. And then on the pure alternative data, we bought DataX a couple of years ago in 2018. And then we acquired last year, Teletrack. And we'll now have the largest data set at something like 80 million Americans outside of the credit file their data from rent-to-own companies, their payment data from auto lenders, subprime auto lenders, sales finance companies, furniture companies, payday lenders. So a very, very rich data set that's additive to the credit file, just like this BNPL data, just like our NC+ data, just like rental data. So it's a broad focus for us. And the cloud capabilities we have in the single data fabric really allow us to bring these new data sources into our environment, into our database. And of course, as you know, we have \u2013 we've built out and now are adding to our single data fabric where we're going to have data keyed and linked for an individual. Every data element that we have will be put together that way, which is, again, as a part of the benefits of our big cloud investments that we're making. Kyle Peterson : Great, that\u2019s really helpful. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ashish Sabadra from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow up on an earlier comment around the expansion of Workforce Solution into nonmortgage. I was wondering if you could give some color on the pipeline for new clients and government sector, talent solution as well as auto, personal consumer loans. Any color on those fronts on the pipeline, how does that look for new clients? Thanks. Mark Begor : Yes. As you heard from our comments earlier, that's a very fast-growing space for us, which I think you were broadly talking about our nonmortgage portion of Workforce Solutions, which is growing very, very strongly. Government is a big vertical for us. We've been expanding there. Appriss makes us stronger. We signed and launched the SSA contract last year. That's ramping. So that's another new solution. We see a lot of potential in government. Talent is a very big space for us with big potential. In my comments earlier, I shared the point that we only today see one in 10 inquiries around the hiring process. So big runway, and that business has been growing strong, strong double digits in the hiring space. And we see big potential when you combine some of the Appriss data, the National Student Clearinghouse education data and of course, as John mentioned, the work history we have. We have a history on individuals because we've been accumulating records over the last 10-plus years, and we average something like 5.5 jobs for every American. So that work history is extremely valuable in that hiring process for 75 million people a year were hired. So that's a big growth area for us. We talked about Employer Services or Employer Solutions, where we're delivering HR compliance generally solutions to HR managers to do that work for them. A lot of those \u2013 a lot of that work today is in-sourced. We pick up the outsourcing of it either directly or through our partners. And that's another area that's been growing. And of course, we've done a bunch of M&A there that strengthen us. And the three bolt-on acquisitions last year of HIREtech, i2verify and Health e(fx) and then the acquisition we announced and closed this week of Efficient Hire, those strengthen us in that space of delivering those W-2, I-9 verification, Work Opportunity Tax Credit, all those other solutions, to HR managers. Of course, they bring records to us, which is very valuable. So we see a really very attractive growth potential. And then in Financial Services, to your question, we've been growing very strongly outside of mortgage. Auto is a space that's growing for us, using our income and employment data along with credit data. Personal loans, we have very strong penetration there that \u2013 using income and employment data. And then in cards, we've got a couple of big issuers now that are combining our income and employment data with the credit file at origination, and we expect that to grow also. So that's a new opportunity for us. So a lot of potential for Workforce Solutions. And of course, most of the verticals we just talked about are way different than our traditional credit bureau verticals, meaning we\u2019re in spaces that are growing faster than our core credit bureau space. But they also diversify Equifax very, very broadly. From being historically more traditional financial services, we\u2019re now much more diversified than we will be in the future as we grow. Ashish Sabadra : That\u2019s great color. Congrats on that. And maybe if I can just ask kind of a follow-up question. You mentioned significant competitive wins on the core credit bureau side as well. I was wondering if you could provide any color on that front. How much of that is being driven by the differentiated income verification that you have using that as a land-and-expand strategy? And any other color where you\u2019re seeing this competitive win, traditional FIs, fintech? Any color will be helpful. Thanks. Mark Begor : Yes. We didn\u2019t talk about specific wins, but we did talk about when I used the term momentum by our USIS team competitively. And that\u2019s really driven by areas that you talked about. It\u2019s our differentiated data, which, of course, we\u2019re expanding. It\u2019s the build-out of the single data fabric, which makes our data more accessible. We have more data than our competitors and then we have it in a way that\u2019s more easily utilized and then the cloud capabilities and cloud functionality that is increasingly in the marketplace. We\u2019re seeing that give us a leg up in those competitive discussions that we view as positive going forward for USIS and for Equifax. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks and congrats once again on a strong quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Andrew Nicholas from William Blair. Your line is now live. Andrew Nicholas : Hi, good morning. First question, I wanted to follow up again on talent solutions. Mark, you mentioned a few times now that you get an inquiry on one in 10 hires in the United States. I guess I\u2019m wondering what drives that number higher or the factors that could drive that higher? Is it primarily adding client relationships? Is it adding records and increasing hit rates? Or is there a component of that is dependent on employers themselves increasingly including income and employment verification screens in their onboarding process? Just trying to get a sense for drivers and maybe what falls within Equifax\u2019s control? Mark Begor : Yes. Just to clarify, we don\u2019t do income verification. It\u2019s really employment history that we deliver there. And the one item we just wanted to point out there\u2019s a lot of runway in this. We have a large business. It\u2019s growing very rapidly in the talent solutions space as we continue to grow. And the drivers are really driven by first, it\u2019s our work history that we have. We have well over 0.5 billion total records, which is \u2013 think about that 5.5 jobs on the average American. So if you don\u2019t come to Equifax, you\u2019ve got to go manually to each of those companies in order to verify that. So the one-click instant kind of data element for Equifax is from Workforce Solutions is what\u2019s driving the growth. We\u2019re also productizing it. We\u2019re in the early stages of bringing new solutions to market that really solve our customers. In this case, it\u2019s either a background screener typically, but it could also be an individual company. But it\u2019s really how do we help them complete their job more quickly. And speed is really important. It always has been in the hiring process. You think about it, when someone\u2019s being hired for a new job, there\u2019s typically an open job there. And the hiring manager wants them to start quickly because there\u2019s work to be done, whether it\u2019s in a fast food restaurant or in a warehouse or a white-collar job, speed is very important. And if we\u2019re able to deliver that instant decision that shortens that time between offer of employment and start of work, it\u2019s really a big opportunity. So we\u2019re going to in 2022 bring new solutions that will likely be more job category based. Meaning we\u2019ll combine our work history, which is the foundation of that, meaning where you worked in the past, adding to educational data that we now have from National Student Clearinghouse. You have the criminal justice data that\u2019s typically used in a background screen. We can package that up in individual solutions. So it\u2019s really a very attractive growth opportunity for us that \u2013 and what really drove the solution is it starts with our big database. Having that 0.5 billion records in that work history gives us something that\u2019s incredibly unique that no one else has. And as we productize it with some of the other data elements, that will be a way to continue to grow. And we\u2019d like to do more M&A. Appriss is a big example of that. That brought the criminal justice incarceration data and also medical credentialing data. There\u2019s other data elements that we\u2019d like to either partner or add to. And of course, we mentioned a couple of times that we added the education data, which a lot of white-collar jobs, there\u2019s a requirement to verify where you go to school. And we can do that instantly now, and we\u2019ll productize that in combining the multiple data elements we have to help speed up the decisioning for our customers. So we see big growth potential here. John Gamble : What\u2019s happening in talent feels a lot like what happened in mortgage. If you look back over time in mortgage as the depth of the database increased substantially, our penetration went up very, very rapidly. And that\u2019s what drove a lot of growth. And as Mark described, the depth of TWN but also all these other data assets has now made our ability to respond with a more complete response and talent, which is obviously harder because there\u2019s more information there has improved dramatically over the past two to three years. And so that\u2019s why even before acquiring Appriss, we were talking about organic growth rates that were on the order of 100%, right? So we feel like we\u2019ve hit an inflection point in talent as well. Andrew Nicholas : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then for my follow-up, just on international opportunity within Workforce Solutions. I know you asked \u2013 or a question was asked on that earlier. Just wanted to ask on kind of the mix between organic and inorganic growth there. I know to this point, it\u2019s been limited in terms of M&A, but is that part of the strategy? Or in the near to medium term, is that primarily an organic effort adding to kind of the UK and Australian capabilities? Thanks. Mark Begor : It\u2019s definitely an organic focus. We\u2019d love to do some M&A, but there\u2019s really nothing out there. There are others that do this that we\u2019ve seen or found. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re leveraging our core technology. It\u2019s now cloud based. We also have relationships with multinationals, where we\u2019re doing their income employment verification here in the United States, and they have operations in other countries, so they want us to do it there. So that\u2019s kind of a base load that we can add to the data set organically. And then same thing with either leveraging our existing payroll partnerships here in the United States are working with new HR providers or payroll processors in those markets to add records. That\u2019s all the approach. So it\u2019s definitely organic. Andrew Nicholas : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Simon Clinch from Atlantic Equities. Your line is now live. Simon Clinch : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question today. Just on that last question. I wanted to follow on with the international opportunity Workforce Solutions. Could you talk about the ability or necessity for you to sort of establish the same kind of strength of competitive moat you have in the U.S. in international markets to make this work? Or is it \u2013 is the environment sort of different in terms of how you need to build this? Mark Begor : Well, our goal would be to have a similar competitive strength globally. We think that we have a lot of opportunities to do that. In many of our markets that we\u2019re in today, we\u2019re really the only one doing it. The couple of markets, I believe in the UK, Experian has talked about trying to do something like what we\u2019re doing but not in other markets. But we think we have a lot of competitive strengths. We\u2019ve got a technology stack that we\u2019ve invested hundreds of millions of dollars, and it\u2019s now cloud-based. We have the relationships that I talked about, and we have the know-how. So we\u2019re going to approach it. These take time to build. It takes time to build out the records and the record contributors. Remember, it took us over a decade to get Workforce Solutions to some level of scale in a big market like the United States. We\u2019ll likely be able to do that more quickly in these other markets because of the leverage we have in our technology and relationships in the marketplace. But it will definitely get built out. And we\u2019ll likely do other markets beyond the four that we\u2019re in. That will be a part of our growth strategy. Simon Clinch : Understood. Okay. And just as a follow-up, just going back to the mortgage market and the outlook you provided. I guess I\u2019m quite interested in what \u2013 maybe we could explore the levers you have to pull within your mortgage franchise in periods if the mortgage market were to be significantly weaker than you anticipated in your guidance? What are the things you can do to try and mitigate some of that downside within? Mark Begor : Yes, sure. I would argue it already, at least our outlook is significantly weaker. We, a few months ago, thought it\u2019d be down 15 for 2022, and now we\u2019re down 21.5. That\u2019s meaningfully different than \u2013 I think it\u2019s quite powerful that Equifax has the momentum from the fourth quarter and the strength to offset that. We\u2019re very pleased with that. It shows the strength of the underlying business. We finished the fourth quarter quite strongly and had momentum coming into the year. We would look to continue to outperform going forward. We can\u2019t predict that at this stage because we are working with it down 21.5. But when you combine the down 21.5 with the decline in 2020, the mortgage market has moved substantially at least in our forecast towards the normalization. And then we think a lot, and I\u2019m sure you do too, about there\u2019s obviously the interest rate impact, which is primarily what factored into our reset of the mortgage market. But still offsetting that is a very sizable home price appreciation that we\u2019ve never seen in kind of the last 20 years that is a positive that we think could dampen at least further declines. It's hard to forecast what's going to happen with interest rates, but there's a lot of equity for consumers to access. And historically, when consumers have that ability to do cash-out refis, they will do that to do home improvement, to do vacations or other things they're going to do. So those are some of the elements that we think about. But just on our so-called updated guidance with mortgage down meaningfully from where we thought a few months ago and then the ability to offset that, we think that shows the strength and breadth of the underlying Equifax business. John Gamble : And we're like most companies, right? We run a broad group of risks and opportunities against our plans. And we wouldn't \u2013 we try to cover our risk across the entire company, right? And obviously, mortgage market is a risk that everyone is dealing with in our industry. And we work across Equifax to drive growth through more MDI, everything Mark's already talked about, to give us opportunities to cover additional risk. Simon Clinch : That's great. Thanks very much. Mark Begor : Thanks, Simon. Operator : Thank you. Your next question today is coming from Hamzah Mazari from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Mario Cortellacci : Hi. This is Mario Cortellacci on for Hamzah. Just my first question, I know you guys already talked about some of the competition within EWS. But just, I guess, we're also hearing that new entrants are getting into that verification space. And just wanted to get your thoughts on, I guess, other competitors getting D1 certification and maybe then getting access to records at cheaper costs. Does that hold any water from your perspective? And then also, could you just talk about the consent mechanisms and how your business could be different from some of those new entrants again around consent? Mark Begor : Yes. I think you're talking about versus what you would call our traditional competitors. I think you're talking more about some of the fintechs that are doing consented data kind of acquisitions. And we have solutions there, too. We have a partnership with Yodlee here in the United States. We have in other markets where we do consented data. There's a lot of friction involved in consented data. And it starts with you have to disrupt the process as a mortgage process or a credit card process or an auto process to ask the consumer to give their user ID and password for their bank account or their user ID and password for their payroll processor or their user ID and password for their employee benefits site at their company. And there's just a lot of fallout of consumers that aren't willing to do that. And we've just seen \u2013 it's certainly a niche that we're playing in, but it's one that we haven't seen real traction in. And then second is the fact that most of our customers, actually all of them, want instant verifications. Meaning just pinging our database and we send back the element, you don't have that friction and time. It could take hours, days, who knows dependent upon a digital process, to have that consent process take place. So that the instant verification is when we're in a workflow with our customer, meaning they're processing a mortgage, it gets to a certain point, they ping our database. And we deliver in milliseconds the verification of that. So I think it's a niche, but we really don't view them as competitors. As John pointed out earlier in the conversation, we still think about our biggest competitor being paper paystubs. That's the one that we continue to displace through instant. Again, there's friction with paper paystubs. Someone's got to go get them. There's a lot of fraud involved. We do that instant verification. You asked a question about access our records at a lower price. We've said many times, including the three new relationships we signed late in the year, that our relationships are exclusive. And exclusive means exclusive, meaning they're not accessible by others, which is the way we want to have those relationships kind of broadly and our partners do also. And then remember, 60% of our records come from individual companies. Those are very hard to access even through a consumer-consented process. And then I'll just end I think with your question about our consent process. As you know, we authenticate anyone who uses our data, and we require anyone who uses our data to follow Fair Credit Reporting Act processes where the individual, the consumer has to consent to access to their data. So no data is used without a consumer consenting in Workforce Solutions, of course, or in our credit file business. And that's inherent in the security and privacy processes that we have. And on top of that, we're credentialing or authenticating the company that's using the data, which is another element in ensuring that they follow the Fair Credit Reporting Act processes. Mario Cortellacci : Understood. And then \u2013 so it sounds like these new fintech entrants are, like you say, more of a niche. But you guys are also, I guess, pursuing M&A opportunities. You did the Efficient Hire deal as well. And I guess just maybe you could talk about some of the other Workforce Solution, M&A deal that you could pursue? And do those new fintech entrants pose any competition that could help \u2013 that could drive up valuation for those deals? Mark Begor : We don't think consumer-consented income and employment verification is an M&A target for us. We already have the ability to do it ourselves through other partnerships we have. And we view it as a niche, although we bought a consumer-consented business in the U.K. really because of open data. But that was one that really is more U.K.-centric. The other acquisitions we've done were really to strengthen our Employer Services or solutions business, where we provide compliance and regulatory services to HR managers. And that's a big business for us. It's one where they typically do that themselves and then outsource to someone like Equifax because we can do it with a higher degree of accuracy, privacy, efficiency. And that's W-2 management. It's I-9 verification. It's Work Opportunity Tax Credit, Employee Resource Credit, HCA, et cetera, those compliance services, I-9 verification. So we provide those services. And the three and now four acquisitions we've done with Efficient Hire that we did this week really strengthen us in those services elements to the HR manager. And then as a part of that solution, we also get TWN records. So it's another way for us to obtain records. So that's really our M&A focus there. There aren't a lot of those opportunities. Of course, we acquired another very attractive one this week in Efficient Hire and of course, three last year, as we pointed out. And then the other M&A focus for us is around our talent data hub. And that's the Appriss acquisition that we closed on in October, really attractive team and business that we brought in and brought in unique data at scale around incarceration and criminal justice and also medical credentialing data. And that's an area where we've been very clear that we'd like to do more M&A both in Employer Services, like Efficient Hire this week. We'd also like to do more M&A around data that's used in the hiring process like Appriss to build out the Equifax data hub. Mario Cortellacci : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Mark Begor : Hey, George. George Tong : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. As you think about your TWN database, approximately what portion of records there are covered by exclusive relationships with payroll processors and software providers? Just trying to get a sense for if a competitor were to try to replicate a portion of your scale in verification, could they quickly scale by also partnering with some of the payroll processors or software providers that you partner with? Mark Begor : Yes. And George, I would add to the question maybe to complete it. Also the records we obtained directly through individual companies to kind of complete the equation. Now you can decide how you define those. We think of those as they're not exclusive, meaning individual companies which is 60% of our records, but they're very sticky to Equifax and our view is HR managers aren't going to share those records with two companies. And remember, we generally obtain individual company records because we're providing unique services to that HR manager, whether its unemployment claims, W-2 management, et cetera. With regards to the 40-plus percent from partners, we've been very clear that the vast, vast, I'll say vast twice, majority of those relationships are exclusive, and exclusive means exclusive there. And our intention is to have them all be exclusive over time. They're not all exclusive. And as you know, the relationships \u2013 all the relationships we've added in the last two years have been exclusive, including the three that we signed in December. And it's our intention for them to be exclusive as we sign them going forward. Does that help? George Tong : Yes. Very helpful. Thank you. And then secondly, on margins, you're expecting up to 200 bps of margin expansion this year. And part of the flow-through on margin performance assumes reinvestments back into the business. So you talked a lot about new product innovation. Any other areas of investments, maybe specific areas around cloud or tech or infrastructure, et cetera, that you're putting money back into the business in order to support the growth? Mark Begor : Yes. You're always making investments. I think you pointed out one is clearly our priority of ours is to continue to invest in product capabilities and resources, and new products require some investment. And of course, the 200 that you mentioned is net of those reinvestments that we're making this year, which we're continuing. And you know that we've been investing in product capabilities really for the last couple of years as we've been growing out that capability. Data analytics is another area that we're investing in, whether it's new data being contributed like the BNPL data that requires some investment or new contributors to TWN, rental data, et cetera. So that's a priority of ours as we're investing. We've got some commercial footprint investments that we're making in 2022, as you would expect, to continue to grow our commercial coverage, which is quite strong but are intended to make it stronger. And then, of course, we're continuing to complete the cloud transformation that underlies that investment and also receive the net benefits as we decommission some of our legacy infrastructure during 2022, which will be a positive for us and reflected in that 200 bps. Anything, John? John Gamble : No. George Tong : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Your line is now live. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two questions. I think one probably for John and one for you. Maybe just starting with John. Just in terms of the growth, there was an improvement in the expectations from the core non-mortgage from the 3Q to the 4Q, and it's very helpful in terms of maintaining the guidance. I wanted to ask, is there a part of the non-mortgage business that accelerated materially over the last 3.5 months or so? Or is it that we're kind of further into \u2013 closer to delivering on the 2022 numbers as you're already getting into the year? Or do you have more visibility? Do you feel more comfortable with that? Maybe you can comment on that first? John Gamble : Sure. So I think Mark talked about it, right? And we saw a real acceleration in record additions and product launches, right, at EWS specifically, right? So I think that's where we saw acceleration. Certainly, as you get closer to a period, right, you get more visibility, and that's part of it. But no, we really did see very nice improvement in growth as it relates to record additions and things that would be very beneficial in 2022 in Workforce Solutions that affects not only mortgage, but also all the other non-mortgage areas that we talked about and also those three substantial payroll providers that we indicated we signed that have not gone into production yet. So it gives us more comfort in the pace of new record addition as well, which also adds to new products, right? I mean, as we get deeper data sets, more history, new product launches accelerate. So all of those things work together to give us confidence, that we can that cover that 6.5% incremental decline in the mortgage market. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Great. Thank you. And then just overall, how are you guys thinking about inflation impact beyond like the very near term? The impact on the consumer in terms of higher cost of living for just basic staples and things like that, how do you think that's going to interact with kind of the view of the banks on credit and their willingness to lend? Right now, things are pretty loose. But if this kind of continues for the two, three more quarters, do you think that, that's going to have a longer-term impact in terms of just kind of the credit cycle on the consumer side and how that would impact that side of the business? Mark Begor : I think you got to kind of layer another leg on that is how might it impact the economy. But as you know, while inflation is up, wages are up also. And job growth is up, people are working. During the last 24 months, they've strengthened broadly their credit position, meaning that a lot of the stimulus money has been used to make men pays and pay down credit card balances. So as we enter 2022, you've got a consumer that broadly is much better positioned than they were two years ago when we entered COVID. So I think that is a positive for our customers and a positive for us. The other thing that, again, going beyond the consumer is that a lot of our customers have experienced deleveraging, meaning customers paying down balances. So they're focused, and you've seen that in our FMS marketing revenue, they're focused on going after new customers that generally are more creditworthy. I think on a \u2013 over the last two years, credit scores have gone up something like 20 points on average because of the stimulus money and now increasingly, people are working. So that's how I would think about it that we're still in a pretty attractive environment. Now how long does inflation hold up? What happens \u2013 what does the Fed do with interest rates beyond what they've kind of indicated? I think those are all different factors. But my expectation is 2022 should be pretty good for the consumer, meaning they're strong and then good for us because our customers are going to be looking to grow their business with those consumers. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from George Gregory from BNP Paribas. Your line is now live. George Gregory : Thank you very much for taking my question. I wanted to dig in a little bit, please, to the verification non-mortgage trend, please. I think, Mark, you called out Q4 non-mortgage organic growth of around 30%. When I compare that to the second quarter, I think in the second quarter, it was total growth of around 65%. I don't think there was a great bit of nonorganic growth in that. When I look at the two year stack, that would seem to suggest that maybe a little bit of deceleration despite presumably the SSA contract, which has been ramping up into the fourth quarter and \u2013 the growth from the new records. Just wondering if you could maybe elaborate on that sort of sequential trend? And if there was anything that would have held the fourth quarter back relative to that very strong second quarter, please? Thank you. John Gamble : Let me just \u2013 I know Mark jump in, but let me just give you some background rate. So the \u2013 so I think we're seeing very, very good growth in talent solutions and government, organic and inorganic. And part of what you're seeing is just a year-over-year effect. If you went back and looked at our results last year, you started seeing accelerated growth in talent solutions as you got into late third quarter and really fourth quarter of last year is my recollection. So I think part of what you're seeing is just a year-over-year effect. And it was \u2013 we started to see \u2013 really see the acceleration in the growth of some of those non-mortgage businesses. As records grew, it's kind of everything we talked about before. So we feel very good about the growth of non-mortgage across verification services and its direction and pace. Mark Begor : I would add, these numbers are quite exceptional, right? Those kind of growth rates. And as we look at quarter \u2013 year-over-year kind of growth on a quarterly basis, they're growing over kind of exceptional performance. And just adding to it, clearly, outperforming the long-term framework we put in place in November for Workforce Solutions of 13 to 15, which is kind of how that \u2013 their piece of our 8 to 12 going forward, they're clearly outperforming that. And there's a lot of factors there, whether it's records, penetration, new product rollouts. They've been performing very, very strongly. And then we expect that to continue to have a very strong 2022 from workforce. George Gregory : Thank you, John. Thank you, Mark. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners. Your line is now live. Craig Huber : Thank you. My first line of questions, I apologize if you already covered this, your sort of outlook for your business for credit cards, autos, and personal loans. I mean given the higher rates this year of inflation, what is sort of your outlook for those three segments for you guys? Mark Begor : You're talking about the market growth versus our growth? Craig Huber : Why don't we talk on your growth, what I mean. Credit cards, auto loans. How do we think about that this year? Mark Begor : Yes, we typically don't give actual segment growth like that as a part of our guidance, but let me just give some color about how we think about those verticals is that there's a couple of questions ago, I talked about cards and so on. We think card growth will be positive for us and for the industry in 2022 as card issuers are looking to rebuild their balance sheets after they come down. P loans is another one that should be positive in \u2013 for the industry in 2022. There was some real tightening in 2020 as we went into COVID. That started to relax as we got into the mid parts of 2021. So that should be a benefit. Auto is broadly strong from a consumer demand standpoint, but you've got the supply chain issues, meaning there aren't available autos, which have dampened some of that. Whether those supply chain issue's sorted out is hard to see, not my strength. But there's underlying consumer demand there that's quite strong. John Gamble : The only thing we did say is in our 2022 guidance for USIS non-mortgage, which includes more than the three segments you just referenced, it includes identity and fraud. It includes commercial and some other segments, we had said basically high single digits, up 6% to 8%. So consistent with our long-term framework. Craig Huber : And my follow-up question, you guys have obviously talked a lot about new businesses you guys keep rolling out here to your credit and stuff. How do you think about margins for those businesses when you roll them out? Are they almost at the segment level pretty soon, given your infrastructure you have in place, the data you already have? Or said differently, how long does it generally take when you roll out new products for it to get to the segment level margins? And how should we think about? Mark Begor : Generally, we think about new products is generally being quite accretive to our margins because they're generally \u2013 think about our Vitality Index of $500 million of growth over the last three years. Those are generally incremental revenue, and they have high incremental margins. So that's kind of how we think about it. So they deliver margin pretty quickly that are accretive to our historical growth rates. And that's why we're so focused on new products because they drive our top line and then the incremental nature of that growth is expanding our margins. Craig Huber : Great. Thank you guys. Mark Begor : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Dorian for any further or closing comments. Dorian Hare : Thank you for joining today's call. We look forward to engaging with you further in meetings and conferences during the quarter. And of course, we look forward to convening again when we report our Q1 earnings in April. This does conclude the call. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello, and welcome to the Equifax First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead. John Gamble : Thanks and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; and Trevor Burns, Head of Investor Relations. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the IR Calendar section of the News and Events tab at our IR website, www.investor.equifax.com. During the call today, we will be making reference to certain materials that can also be found in the Presentations section of the News and Events tab at our IR website. These materials are labeled Q1 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Also, we will be making forward-looking statements, including second quarter and full year 2022 guidance to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors that may impact our business are set forth in our filings with the SEC, including our 2021 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. We will also be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of underlying operational performance. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and can be found in the Financial Results section of the Financial Info tab at our IR website. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter of 2021, we eliminated our GCS operating segment and moved its lines of business into Workforce Solutions, USIS, and international in Canada and Europe. As a result, Equifax now has three operating segments. You can find reconciliations of our 2020 and 2021 prior business unit operating segment results to this new structure in the 4Q '21 earnings release Q&A. Equifax has a non-controlling ownership interest in a Credit Bureau in Russia. We are providing no operational or financial support to the company. In the first quarter, we wrote off our investment and reflected a $19.5 million one-time charge. And beginning with the first quarter of 2022, we are no longer reflecting income from the venture. Also in the first quarter, Equifax deposited the remaining balance of $345 million into the restitution fund for the U.S consumer class action settlement. Now, I would like to turn it over to Mark. Mark Begor : Thanks, John. Equifax is off to a very strong start in 2022 and delivered a record $1.36 billion of revenue which was up 12% and well above the levels we discussed with you in February. We continue to execute very well under delivering strong core revenue growth while delivering on our key EFX 2023 strategic initiatives. However, as we look to the remainder of 2022, we are reducing our full year financial guidance reflecting the likelihood of a much more substantial decline in the U.S mortgage market than we expected in February. Over the past several months, mortgage rates have increased more rapidly and expected with the 30-year mortgage rate reaching over 5% last week, a 10-year high. And there's increased expectation for further increases in U.S interest rates as we move through 2022 as the Fed manages record levels of inflation. As a result, our guidance now reflects the likelihood of a much more rapid and significant decline in mortgage originations than we expected a few months ago. With U.S mortgage credit inquiries for the -- over the last 9 months of '22, declining on the order of 37.5% or 38%. Over the last half of 2022, we expect U.S mortgage credit inquiries to be down 40%, which we believe is equivalent to mortgage originations being down more than 40% and is in line with most market forecasts including NBA and Fannie Mae. This level of mortgage market credit inquiries over the last half of 2022 is approaching 25%, below the 5-year average levels we saw prior to the beginning of the pandemic in 2020 and also pulls forward the mortgage market declines we had expected in 2023 into 2022. U.S mortgage credit inquiries in early April are beginning to show some of this weakening and are at levels somewhat weaker than we saw in the first quarter, but are not anywhere near the levels of decline we've included in our guidance. However, given the recent substantial increase in mortgage rates and expectation for further rate increases, high inflation and the war in Ukraine, our guidance reflects the much higher likelihood of a more significant decline in U.S mortgage market as we move through the second quarter, and continued significant sequential declines as we move through the balance of the year. We thought it was prudent to de-risk our guidance for the mortgage market and pull forward from 2023 the normalization of the mortgage market into '22. For the full year, this results in U.S mortgage credit inquiries being down about 33.5% for the year, which is almost 10% below the 5-year average levels we saw prior to the beginning of the pandemic and 2020 and about 12 percentage points below the 21.5% decline in our February guidance. For the balance of the year, this equates to a 37.5% reduction versus the same period in 2021. And as I mentioned earlier, a run rate of 40 -- minus 40%, which is 25% below the 5-year pre-pandemic levels in the latter parts of 2022. The impact on our revenue guidance of this additional 12% reduction in the mortgage market is over 350 basis points or over $175 million. We expect to offset just under half of the mortgage revenue declined with stronger core revenue growth that will now exceed 17% from stronger workforce solutions performance and NPI rollouts, which is an increase of about 150 basis points or $175 million for the year. Broadly, Equifax is operating very well with our first quarter core growth of 21%. Together this results in a reduction in our full year revenue guidance by $100 million to a midpoint of $5.2 billion, which is still up a solid 6% after absorbing an over $500 million decline from the mortgage market. The $100 million reduction in revenue and the elimination of income from our non-controlling interest in our Russian joint venture of $0.12 a share, drives our guidance for EBITDA margin expansion in '22 to about 125 basis points increase, but a reduction of 50 basis points from our prior framework. This also results in guidance for our adjusted EPS to a midpoint of $8.15 a share or reduction of $0.50 per share. As I mentioned, at these levels, we still deliver solid '22 revenue growth of 6% and adjusted EPS growth of 7% despite a significant mortgage market decline impacting our revenue by almost 10.5 points, or over $500 million. Our ability to deliver 17% core revenue growth reflects the underlying breadth, depth and strength of the Equifax business model, and is well above our new long-term growth framework of 8% to 12%. John will provide more details on our view of the mortgage market and our guidance shortly. Turning to Slide 4, the first -- in the first quarter, we delivered revenue and adjusted EPS above the high end of our guidance range. Revenue at $1.36 billion was up 12% with our organic constant currency growth of 8%, and was the highest quarterly revenue in our history, and our ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. This was delivered despite a U.S mortgage market or credit inquiries were down 24.5% in the in the quarter about as expected. Core revenue growth of 21% and core organic revenue growth at 17% were both very strong and well above our new long-term financial framework. Our growth was again powered by our U.S businesses Workforce Solutions and USIS. In total, Workforce Solutions and USIS generated $1.08 billion in revenue, almost 80% of Equifax total revenue, with 14% total and 7.5% organic revenue growth, again, despite the 24.5% decline in the U.S mortgage market inquiries. Non-mortgage U.S revenue represented over 60% of total U.S revenue and delivered growth of over 32% total, with organic growth of just over 18%. International also delivered strong revenue growth of 10% in local currency, above the high end of their long-term framework of 7% to 9%. First quarter adjusted Equifax EBITDA totaled $484 million, up 12% and EBITDA margins of 35.5% were in line with our expectations for the quarter. Adjusted EPS at $2.22 a share was up a strong 13% from last year and above the guidance of $2.08 to $2.18 we provided in February, driven by strong revenue growth and progress in realizing the benefits of our cloud technology transformation. We continue to accelerate our EFX cloud data and technology transformation in the quarter, including migrating approximately an additional 10,700 customers to the cloud in the U.S and approximately 1,500 customers internationally, as well as decommissioning two significant data centers this month. As you may have also seen, we recently issued our second annual security report, which is another important illustration of our ESG commitment and the power of our EFX cloud transformation and cloud technology and data transformation. In 2018, we committed that Equifax will become an industry leader in security. Our latest report highlights our investments in market leading cybersecurity capabilities and talent that enable us to detect and respond to threats with more speed and precision. We view our leading security capabilities as another competitive advantage for Equifax. Leveraging our new EFX cloud infrastructure, we continue to accelerate new product innovations. In the first quarter, we released about 30 new products continuing momentum from 2021 where we launched a record 151 new products. We're seeing increasing commercial traction and revenue generation from these new products leveraging the new Equifax cloud. In the quarter, our vitality index defined as revenue from new products introduced in the last 3 years exceeded 12%. This is over a 300 basis point improvement from our 900 -- 9% vitality index last year, and the highest level for Equifax in the last decade. For 2022, we now expect a vitality index of over 11%, up 100 basis points from the 10% guidance we provide in February -- we provided in February, which will fuel our growth in 2022, 2023 and beyond. In the first quarter, we invested our strong free cash flow in two strategic bolt on acquisitions, with a focus on accelerating growth in Workforce Solutions with the acquisition of Efficient Hire and expanding our geographic footprint with the acquisition of Data-Credito, the largest Credit Bureau in the Dominican Republic. Bolt on acquisitions that broaden and strengthen Equifax are strong leverage to accelerate our growth and are central to our long-term growth framework to add 100 to 200 basis points to our revenue growth from strategic bolt on acquisitions. Even facing the macro mortgage market headwinds, we are energized by our strong start to 2022 and are clearly seeing the momentum from our EFX 2022 growth strategy leveraging our new EFX cloud capabilities. Turning now to Slide 5. In the first quarter, Equifax core revenue growth, the green sections of the bars, grew very strong 21% which was above our expectations and substantially above our long-term framework -- financial framework of 8% to 12%. Core organic revenue growth of 17% in the quarter was also substantially above the long-term framework. Non-mortgage growth in EWS and international as well as the U.S drove about two-thirds of our core organic revenue growth in the quarter. Strong 27% core mortgage outperformance in Workforce Solutions drove the remaining third of first quarter core organic revenue growth. With our strong 21% core growth in the first quarter, and accelerating NPI rollouts, we now expect 2022 core revenue growth of over 17%, which is up about 150 basis points from our February guidance and 250 basis points from our original 2022 framework. This is driven by broad base strong performance across Workforce Solutions, as well as strength in international, Kount Identity and Fraud, Appriss Insights and accelerating NPIs. As detailed on Slide 6, core mortgage revenue growth in first quarter was up a very strong 17%, driven by Workforce Solutions with their core mortgage revenue growth of 27% and 2% of USIS. Due to the strong core revenue growth, our first quarter mortgage revenue was down only 7% despite the 24.5% decline in overall U.S mortgage market. Core mortgage growth of 27% at Workforce Solutions was consistent with our guidance in February and driven by twin record additions, new products, increased system-to-system integrations and increased penetration. Turning to Slide 7. Workforce Solutions continues to deliver outstanding core revenue growth, delivering over 40% growth for the fourth time in the last five quarters. This is very strong performance is driven -- this very strong performance is driven by Workforce Solutions, consistent execution across their key growth levers. First, growing the work number database. As we mentioned in February, we signed three new exclusive arrangements with large payroll processors late last year that we expect to implement starting in the second quarter. And we signed another new exclusive payroll processor agreement last month that we expect to also bring on board in 2022. We ended the quarter with 135 million total current records, which was up 19% from last year. There are 104 million unique individuals deliver high hit rates and represent about 65% of U.S nonfarm payroll. The flat sequential performance from year-end was also very strong as we offset reductions of approximately 3 million records from the normal seasoning hire declines from the fourth quarter with new record additions. As of today, we're already back to over 136 million records as we have begun boarding records from one of the new exclusive payroll processor agreements we signed late last year. And as a reminder, almost 50% -- 55% of our records are contributed directly by individual employers. Second, EWS's increasing penetration in their key verticals of mortgage, talent, government and consumer finance, with all four verticals having significant opportunity for continued expansion by leveraging our expanded data hub strategy for the fast-growing talent and government markets driving over 80% core growth in these verticals. Third, EWS is delivering increased average revenue per transaction through both higher value new product rollouts and increasing the value or pricing of existing products by expanding the depth and breadth of our data coverage. And finally, Workforce Solutions expanding their system-to-system integrations. Currently more than 75% of our mortgage transactions are system-to-system, up over 2x from 2019. As you know, we get a 20% plus lift in mortgage polls when we convert our customers from the web to system integrations. In talent solutions, system-to-system now represents more than 80% of our transactions. And last, Workforce Solutions continues to add capabilities in records through strategic bolt on acquisitions. Over the past 2 years, we've completed five bolt on acquisitions supporting EWS growth, including Appriss Insights last fall and Efficient Hire a few weeks ago. The strength of Workforce Solutions and unique system value of their twin income and employment data was clear again in the first quarter. Rudy Ploder and EWS team delivered another outstanding quarter with 33% revenue growth, well above their 13% to 15% long-term framework and are positioned to deliver a very strong '22 and continue above market growth in the future. Turning to more details and Workforce Solutions on Slide 5, another exceptional quarter delivering record revenue of $649 million, their first quarter above $600 million. Revenue growth was up a very strong 33% with organic revenue growth of 20% despite the significant decline in the U.S mortgage market. Core revenue growth was a very strong 45% in the quarter with core organic revenue growth of 34%. Non-mortgage is now 60% of Workforce Solutions revenue, delivering organic growth of over 30%. Verification Services revenue was over $500 million for the first time, with strong growth driven by non-mortgage verticals that represent almost 50% of Verifier revenue and delivered 90% total and 50% organic growth. The inorganic growth was driven by the acquisition of Appriss Insights that performed very well during the quarter, driven by higher volumes, product penetration and new customer wins. Talent and Government Solutions, which now represent 30% and almost 40% of Verifier non-mortgage, respectively, both had outstanding quarters and combined were up a very strong 100% total and over 55% organic growth. The continued expansion of the Workforce Solutions data hub and the fast growing $5 billion Talent and $2 billion Government TAMs is driving strong double-digit organic growth in both verticals, leveraging Workforce Solutions over 540 million historical records for new products. The introduction of the unique Appriss Insights National Student Clearinghouse data and other talent related data assets, strengthens our ability to deliver new solutions leveraging the EWS data hub. The non-mortgage consumer lending business principally in banking and auto showed strong growth as well, up 40% in the quarter. Increasing records penetration, system-to-system integrations are driving growth in auto, card and consumer finance and debt management grew over 25% in the quarter. As mentioned earlier, mortgage revenue for Workforce Solutions was up 3% versus last year, 27 points stronger than the overall U.S mortgage market decline and consistent with our expectations that EWS would outperform the mortgage market by approaching 30 points in 2022. Employer Services revenue of $136 million was up a strong 33% in the quarter. Combined our unemployment claims and employee retention credit businesses had revenue of $50 million, up 6% last year, but down 7% sequentially as expected. We expect total UC and ERC revenue to be down about 25% for all of 2022 driven by lower jobless claims and ERC as the COVID federal tax program runs out. Employer Services non-UC and ERC businesses had revenue of $86 million, up over 55% versus last year with strong organic growth of over 15%. Our I9 business driven by our new I9 anywhere product continue to show very strong growth, up over 55%. In the first quarter, our I9 and onboarding business made up over -- made up almost 25% of Employer Services, non-UC and ERC revenue. Our combined Health e(fx) business, which is the combination of Equifax workforce analytics and our Health e(fx) acquisition that we acquired in the third quarter last year represented about 45% of Employer Services non-UC and ERC revenue in the quarter and delivered total growth of just under 70% with organic growth of about 1% as expected. As we discussed, the seasonality of ACA revenue was concentrated in the first half of the year. Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margins were 54.6%, consistent with the guidance we provided February and very strong. The decline in margins versus last year was principally driven by the addition of Appriss Insights and Health e(fx). And as expected, initial margins from these acquisitions are dilutive to Workforce Solutions. As we move through 2022 and drive synergies, this dilutive impact will be mitigated. As shown on Slide 9, continued expansion of the Workforce Solutions data hub is a key strategic focus for Workforce Solutions and the engine driving future growth in the fast-growing Talent and Government Solution markets. Talent Solutions delivered 145% total and 80% organic growth in the quarter. And we began introducing new multi data talent products in the quarter with new product introductions expected to accelerate as we move through 2022 leveraging the Equifax cloud. We also saw strong growth in the government vertical with revenue up 89% total and 39% organic with significant new wins at the state level and continued growth of our large SSA contract. As I mentioned earlier, Appriss Insights performed very well, delivering 20% growth in the quarter from increased volumes, new customers and success with existing products. More broadly, we expect revenues from NPIs to increase as the integration of Appriss Insights continues in the back half of 2022. Shifting now to Slide 10 and USIS, their revenue of $433 million was down 6% compared to first quarter last year, and slightly below our expectations. The decline was driven by the reduction in USIS mortgage revenue, which were $140 million, and is about 30% of total USIS revenue when it was down 21% for the quarter. Positively, this was about 300 basis points stronger than the overall mortgage market decline of 24.5%. Importantly, USIS delivered their fifth consecutive quarter of growth in B2B non-mortgage revenue at $242 million, which represents over 55% of total USIS revenue, and was up 4% with organic revenue growth of 2%. This was somewhat lower than the mid-single-digit organic growth we discussed in February due to the timing of deal closures in their financial marketing services business. Importantly, B2B non-mortgage online revenue growth, which excludes FMS was strong, at up 10% with 6% organic growth. During the quarter, we saw double-digit growth in insurance, commercial and identity and fraud, and auto and direct-to-consumer both showed high single-digit growth. In telco and banking and lending grew in the mid-single digits. Kount had an outstanding quarter with organic revenue growth approaching 50%. The Kount teams now delivered two consecutive quarters of very strong new deal bookings and along with the monetization of synergies between the Kount and Equifax customer and product base and continued vertical expansion. Our core new product growth continues to be very strong in Kount and the team continues to execute on the development of joint solutions, leveraging both Kount and Equifax data that we believe will drive strong growth in '22 and beyond. Financial Marketing Services, our B2B offline business had revenue of $46 million, down 14% from last year's 12% growth. Importantly, we continue to see growth in marketing related projects, but our batch business was below our expectations. As we discussed in the batch -- in the past, our batch or portfolio review project business can be choppy as the revenue is often driven by larger one-time offline data licensing projects. We expect to return to growth in second quarter driven by growth in marketing pre-screen and in the portfolio review solutions inside of FMS. USIS Consumer Solutions business, the U.S D2C business from GCS, it was combined with USIS in the fourth quarter had revenue of $51 million, up 2% year-over-year, which was below our expectations. With their cloud transformation complete, the team is now focused on delivering best-in-class consumer experiences, leveraging the cloud to roll out new products, and leveraging B2B relationships in traditional financial services credit unions and new fintech players to return the business to growth. The USIS sales team had a strong quarter with a number of key wins resulting in a healthy win rate. The new deal pipeline remains very strong with the overall pipeline slightly higher than the fourth quarter. And USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 39.3% in the quarter, about flat with fourth quarter and slightly better than our expectations. Turning to Slide 11, our investments and acquisitions of Unique data assets are positioning U.S for sustainable long-term non-mortgage growth. Our Unique data goes far beyond traditional credit data and contains alternative data covering telco payment history, specialty finance transactions, cash flow and bank transaction, wealth data, e-commerce transactions and unique commercial business data. These Unique and only Equifax datasets provide scores analytics and insights that allow lenders to increase approval rates, expand credit lines and reduce losses, particularly with underbanked consumers. These differentiated alternative data assets are important growth lever for USIS to deliver new solutions that will help expand access to credit and the over 60 million on and underbanked population in the United States. Earlier this week, Equifax announced the new data partnership with Fiserv, a leading global provider of payments and financial services technology solutions to leverage their unique data assets in combinations with -- in combination with Equifax data to deliver new solutions to the market. We intend to co-innovate with Fiserv to develop solutions that will help financial institutions and other businesses embrace the power of expanded data and real-time data insights to drive speed, the Kount acquisition mitigate risk and improve overall customer experience with an initial focus on small business commercial solutions. We're very energized about our new partnership with Fiserv. Shifting now to international on Slide 12. Their revenue of $281 million was up a very strong 10% on a local currency basis. Europe revenue was up 6% -- 16%, driven principally by our U.K debt management business. We've seen significant increases in debt placements from the U.K government over the past several quarters that we expect to continue. As you recall, in December, Equifax was awarded a 4-year extension with the U.K on their government debt resolution contract with an estimated value of $136 million, with an incremental $90 million of potential incremental sales from analytics and other CRA related solutions. Our European CRA business was up 2% in the quarter driven by growth in identity and fraud insurance and telco and partially offset by the U.K direct-to-consumer business which was below our expectations. Asia Pacific revenue was up 6% driven by strong growth in our Australia commercial business, verification services, and identity and fraud. Latin America was up a strong 23% driven by double-digit growth in Chile, Argentina, Mexico and Central America. The team's strong new product introductions over the past 3 years and pricing actions continue to benefit growth across the region. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of growth for Latin America. Canada was up 2% and below our expectations driven by lower volumes in consumer direct and mortgage market declines from higher interest rates. And auto was flat for the quarter. International adjusted EBITDA margins at 25.4% were down 150 basis points, primarily due to the elimination of equity income from our Russian joint venture that John discussed. Excluding this impact, EBITDA margins would have been about flat with last year and slightly -- and up slightly from our expectations. As shown on Slide 13, we're off to a very strong start with our new product vitality index over 12% in the first quarter, which is above our 10% goal for the year and the highest vitality index since we began tracking this measure over 10 years ago. Building on the record 151 new product introductions last year, we delivered about 30 new products so far in 2022, which is on a similar strong pace to the fourth quarter. Some of the more significant new product launches are detailed on the slide. Leveraging our new EFX cloud capabilities to drive new product rollouts, we expect to deliver vitality index in 2022 of over 11%, which equates to over $550 million of new product revenue this year. The 11% vitality is up 100 basis points from our February guidance and up 200 basis points from our strong 2021 results. NPIs are central to our long-term growth framework in driving EFX top line growth. As detailed on Slide 14, reinvesting our strong cash flow in accretive and strategic bolt on M&A is central to our EFX 2023 growth strategy and our new long-term growth framework. We expect to add 1% to 2% of revenue growth each year from strategic bolt on M&A. And we're starting '22 strong with two strategic and accretive bolt on acquisitions, Efficient Hire and Data-Credito. Efficient Hire further strengthens Workforce Solutions by bringing expanded Employer Services to hospitality building services and senior living markets. The acquisition also allows Workforce Solutions to better compete and penetrate the hourly and high-volume hiring market, and of course provides us with incremental twin records. Data-Credito is the largest consumer credit reporting agency in the Dominican Republic that adds to our strong market presence across Latin America. Since the beginning of 2021, we've completed 10 strategic bolt on acquisitions that strengthen and broaden EFX and that fit our M&A priorities. Number one to expand and strengthen our strongest and fastest growing business Workforce Solutions. Number two to add unique data assets. Number three to expand in a fast growing $19 billion identity and fraud space; and number four to work to expand our global credit bureau footprint. We're well down the path of integrating the acquisitions in the EFX cloud and driving synergies to accelerate our growth. And with that, I'll turn it over to John to provide more detail on our second quarter and our full year 2022 guidance. John Gamble : Thanks, Mark. As Mark discussed earlier, we have updated our view of the U.S mortgage market reflecting the significant changes in current and expected future levels of U.S interest rates. As shown on Slide 15, in 2022, we are now expecting declines in U.S mortgage credit, increase of 33% in the second quarter and 40% in the third and fourth quarters of 2022, which we believe is consistent with mortgage originations being down over 40% and is consistent with market forecasts. As we saw in the first quarter, the decline in mortgage inquiries was less than the expected mortgage originations, we believe driven by increased shopping by consumers as rates began to rapidly rise. We expect to see some of the same behavior, but at lower levels as we move through the remainder of the year. As we have shared in prior quarters, Slide 16 provides a view of both the number of home mortgages that would have a rate benefit from refinancing on the left, and a view of the levels of home purchases on the right. Our updated assumptions for U.S mortgage market credit inquiries, we believe are consistent with the trends these charts reflect. The left side of this -- the left side of the slide provides a perspective on the number of home mortgages for which a refinancing would provide a rate benefit, the in-the-money population of mortgages. The in-the-money population as of mid-April when the 30-year fixed rate was about 5% is about 3.3 million homes, down about 80% from the levels we saw in January when rates were 3.6%. As the in-the-money population declines, mortgage refi is increasingly driven by cash out refis, that are often executed with no rate benefit or rate increase. For prospective, for Black Knight data from February 2022, about 25% of refinancings were by borrowers that had an increase in our borrowing rate. As shown on the right side of Slide 16, the pace of existing home purchases continues at historically high levels about consistent with the levels we saw in 2021. Our assumptions for the U.S mortgage market over the last 9 months of 2022 are consistent with the trends just discussed. We have assumed that U.S mortgage purchase market volume stays strong, but declines in the second half by 5% to 10% from the levels we saw in 2021. We're assuming that the U.S refinance market volume declined substantially with volume increasingly driven by cash out refis. We expect refi volume to be down over 50% in 2Q and over 60% by 4Q with significant sequential declines in each quarter. Refinance will be about one-third of total mortgage volume in the second half at the lowest levels we have seen over the last 10 years. Slide 17 provides a revenue walk detailing the drivers of the 6.2% constant currency and 5.6% total revenue growth to the midpoint of our 2022 revenue guidance of $5.2 billion. The 33.5% decline in the U.S mortgage market is negatively impacting 2022 growth by about 10.4%. Over 350 basis points and $175 million more negative than the levels we discussed in February. When combined with the expected declines in the Workforce Solutions unemployment claims and ERC business that we have discussed with you in February, total headwinds in 2022 revenue growth were about 11.5 percentage points. As Mark discussed earlier, core revenue growth is expected to be over 17% and up 150 basis points from the levels discussed in February. Core organic revenue growth is up 120 basis points with the remainder coming from the acquisition of Data-Credito. This stronger core revenue growth drives about $75 million in revenue benefit, offsetting just under half of the impact of the weaker mortgage market. Non-mortgage organic growth is driving almost 60% of the growth. The largest contributor continues to be Workforce Solutions with strong organic growth and talent solutions, government and employee boarding solutions including I9. International and USIS non-mortgage are also expected to drive core growth. Slide 18 provides an adjusted EPS walk detailing the drivers of the expected 7% growth to the midpoint of our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance of $8.15 per share. Revenue growth of 5.6% at our 2021 EBITDA margins of about 33.9% will deliver 8% growth and adjusted EPS. EBITDA margin expansion of about 125 basis points is expected to drive about 6% growth and adjusted EPS. The reduction in EBITDA margin expansion by over 50 basis points from our prior guidance is driven by both the elimination of equity income from our Russian JV, which was reducing margins by over 30 basis points, as well as from the negative margin impact of the net loss of $100 million of high margin online revenue. We are on track to deliver the reductions in tech transformation expenses and savings from migration to our cloud systems that we discussed with you in February. Consistent with our guidance from February, depreciation and amortization is expected to negatively impact adjusted EPS by about 3%. D&A is increasing in 2022, as we accelerate putting cloud native systems into production. The combined increase in interest expense and tax expense in 2022 is expected to negatively impact adjusted EPS by about 4 percentage points. Interest expense is higher in 2022 by about $26 million and higher than our expectation in February by about $6 million. Our estimated tax rate used in this framework of 24.7% does not assume any changes in the U.S federal tax rate. Slide 19 provides the specifics on our 2022 full year guidance, which I also just discussed. At a BU level, our updated view of U.S mortgage impacted both EWS and USIS. EWS is expected to deliver revenue growth of about 15%, as stronger non-mortgage growth is expected to be over 35% partially offsets the impact of the weaker mortgage market. EWS EBITDA margins are expected to be about 54%. USIS revenue is expected to be down 6% to 7%, reflecting the greater 33.5% assumed decline in the U.S mortgage market. Consistent with February, non-mortgage revenue is expected to be up 6% to 8%. USIS EBITDA margins are expected to be about 38%, reflecting the impact of the weaker mortgage market. Consistent with our February guidance, combined EWS and USIS mortgage revenue is expected to outperform the overall market by almost 20 percentage points. And international revenue is expected to deliver constant currency growth of about 79%. International EBITDA margins are expected to be up over 50 basis points. The decline from our February guidance is due to the impact of the loss of income from our Russian JV. Absent this item, our guidance for international EBITDA margins is unchanged. Slide 20 provides our guidance for 2Q '22. We expect revenue in the range of $1.31 billion to $1.33 billion. Acquisitions are expected to positively impact revenue by 4.4%. 2Q '22 EBITDA margins are expected to be flat to down sequentially. Looking at business units in the second quarter, Workforce Solutions revenue growth is expected to be up almost 20% year-to-year with mortgage down mid-single digits and very strong non-mortgage growth continuing. EBITDA margins are expected to be about flat sequentially. USIS revenue is expected to be down about 6%. Non-mortgage is expected to be up 6% to 7%, partially offsetting mortgage revenue down just over 30%. EBITDA margins are expected to be about 38%, reflecting lower mortgage revenue. International revenues expected to be up about 10% year-to-year in constant currency and EBITDA margins are expected to be up slightly sequentially. Corporate expenses expected to be about flat sequentially. We're expecting adjusted EPS in 2Q '22 to be $1.98 to $2.08 per share, compared to 2Q '21 adjusted EPS of $1.98. We believe both our second quarter and full year 2022 guidance are centered at the midpoint of the revenue and adjusted EPS ranges we provided. Now I'd like to turn it back over to Mark. Mark Begor : Thanks, John. As highlighted on Slide 21, we remain laser-focused on our EFX2023 growth strategy to leverage new EFX Cloud for innovation new products. EFX2023 is the foundation for our new 8% to 12% long-term growth framework. We continue to make significant progress executing the EFX data cloud and technology transformation. And we now have over half of our revenue being delivered from the new Equifax cloud. This will build meaningfully in 2022 as we expect to substantially complete our North American cloud migrations. We completed over 120,000 B2B migrations, over 10 million consumer migrations and 1 million data contributor migrations.  In North America, our principal consumer exchanges are in production on our new cloud-based single data fabric and delivering to our customers. Our International transformation is also progressing and is expected to be principally complete by the end of 2023 with some migrations being completed in 2024. And we're in the early days of leveraging our new EFX cloud capabilities, and remain confident that it will differentiate us commercially, expand our NPI capabilities, accelerate our top line growth and expand our margins from the growth and cost savings in 2022 and beyond. We remain on track and confident in our plan to become the only cloud native data analytics technology company. As shown on the next slide, Equifax is increasingly much more than a Credit Bureau and focused on faster growing identity and fraud, talent, employer and government verticals. The consistent execution of our strategy over the past 4 years and the strategic bolt on acquisitions we completed in '21, and so far in 2022, are all aligned with our strategy and in faster growing markets. In 2022, over 50% of Equifax revenue is expected to be outside our traditional consumer and commercial Credit Bureau Market segments, principally in Workforce Solutions and our identity and fraud businesses. These businesses represent about two-thirds of our 45 billion addressable markets in identity and fraud, talent, government, and HR services as well as the employment and income portions of our credit businesses, with growth rates twice as fast as our traditional credit markets. As we move forward, these businesses will increasingly become larger portions of Equifax and drive our top line growth. As shown on Slide 23, very strong 17% core revenue growth in '22 and 22% growth -- core growth last year is driven by our outperformance in higher growth vertical markets. We are a different company today with over 40% of Equifax revenue, delivering over 10% growth. And even more powerful are the businesses delivering over 20% growth in fast growing markets, including Workforce Solutions, which is up 30% -- 33% in the first quarter, with their talent businesses approaching 150%; their government business up about 90%; their consumer lending business up 40%; and I9 anywhere over 50%. Our Kount business and the identity and fraud space delivered almost 50% growth in the fast-growing market. Our Appriss Insights business was up over 20% and our 11% NPI vitality index is fueling our growth. These faster growing verticals in new markets like talent, government and identity and fraud are driving our top line and allow us to outgrow underlying market macros. Wrapping up on Slide 24, Equifax delivered another strong and broad base quarter with 12% overall growth and 21% core growth, more than offsetting the 25% decline in the mortgage market with broad based performance which was above your and our expectations. We are operating very well with strong momentum and now have delivered nine consecutive quarters of strong above market double-digit growth reflecting the power of the new Equifax business model and our execution against our EFX2023 strategic priorities. Equifax is resilient and on offense. We have strong momentum and are delivering the strongest results since the 2017 Cyber Event and arguably the strongest results in the past 10 years at Equifax. At our Investor Day last November, we discussed how the execution of our EFX2023 strategic priorities including the Equifax data and technology cloud transformation, would lead to stronger revenue growth, faster margin expansion and higher adjusted EPS growth. And as you know, we introduced the new long-term financial framework with total revenue growth of 8% to 12%, including 100 to 200 basis points of growth from bolt on acquisitions. We also expect to deliver margin expansion of 50 basis points per year over the long-term that will help us deliver adjusted EPS growth at 12% to 16%, which combined with our 1% dividend yield target will allow us to deliver a total return to shareholders of 13% to 18%. The rapidly changing and unprecedent environment makes forecasting the impacts of the U.S market -- mortgage market incredibly challenging. We do not take guidance changes lightly. But we thought it was prudent to de-risk the year by reducing our U.S mortgage market credit inquiry outlook to down 37.5% for the balance of the year, resulting in a full year decline of 33.5% in our mortgage market. This includes a decline in the mortgage market of 40% in the back half of '22, which is approaching 25% below the 5-year run rate levels from prior to 2020 and pull-forward the market declines we'd expected in 2023 into 2022. We also believe this equates to mortgage originations being down more than 40% in the back half of 2022, which is aligned with most market estimates. We feel this is a prudent and balanced framework given the unprecedented macro environment. Against the declining mortgage market, Equifax is resilient and continues to deliver strong results. Our updated outlook deliver 6% growth offsetting more than $500 million over 10% of mortgage market decline, with strong core revenue growth of 17% in 2022, which is up 150 basis points from our February guide, and over 250 basis points from the framework we shared with you at our Investor Day in November. Our ability to offset the 33.5% decline in the mortgage market and deliver 6% total growth, driven by 17% core growth is powerful. Looking back at the '08, '09 global financial crisis, which is the last time we saw a macro event like this impacting the mortgage market, Equifax revenue was down 6% versus the 6% growth we will deliver in our 2022 framework. We're different company today. A more diverse, resilient, faster growing higher margin, higher free cash flow company, a new Equifax with stronger growth levers. Workforce Solutions is our strongest and fastest growing business and will be north of 45% of our revenue in 2022 with a run rate -- runway to move past 50% of Equifax revenue in the near future. A 33% growth in the first quarter is over 4x the growth rate of the rest of Equifax and the 55% EBITDA margins are over 15 points above our average and highly accretive to Equifax. Workforce Solutions has multiple levers to deliver their 13% to 15% long-term growth rate, which is highly accretive to Equifax. Our core non-mortgage market growth is very strong at 21% in the first quarter and 17% in our new 2022 guidance and above our new 8% to 12% long-term framework. We think about core revenue growth as a strong indicator of the breadth, depth and strength of the underlying Equifax business model. We expect our mortgage teams will continue to outperform the market decline by almost 20 percentage points in 2022, consistent with our February guide, with Workforce Solutions outperforming by approximately 30 points from pricing NPIs new twin records, new customers and system-to-system integrations. And as you know, we're in the early days of leveraging the 50% of Equifax that's now in the Equifax cloud environment and we're just starting to realize the top and bottom-line benefits from the cloud. As we move over the coming months and quarters to be fully cloud native, the top and bottom-line benefits will really kick in over the next 2 to 3 years and drive our top line while enabling us to achieve our 2025 margin goal of 39%. And as we talked on the call this morning, we're ramping our new product capabilities, leveraging our differentiated data assets in the Equifax cloud. Our vitality index in 2022 will now be 11% or over $500 million, which is up 9% last year and 100 basis points from our start in 2021. NPIs are fueling our growth. And last, our 10 bolt on acquisitions in the last 15 months are adding $375 million to our run rate revenue. But more importantly, the M&A synergies will be kicking in during 2022 and 2023 as we complete our integrations and drive our NPI rollouts. To be clear, we believe Equifax continues to operate at a very high level. There's no change in our long-term outlook for Equifax. The change in our mortgage market framework simply pulls forward the market normalization into 2022. We remain confident in our 8% to 12% long-term growth framework and 50 basis points a year of long-term margin expansion that we rolled out at our Investor Day in November. And there's no change to our 2025 goal of $7 billion of revenue and 500 basis points of margin expansion to reach EBITDA margins of 39%. We are a new Equifax. A more resilient, more diverse higher growth and higher margin company. I'm energized by our strong first quarter performance, but even more energized about the future of the new Equifax. I'd like to close by welcoming Trevor Burns back to the Equifax leadership -- senior leadership team. We announced earlier this week that Dorian Hare has taken another position outside of Equifax and we wish him well. We'd like to thank Dorian for his service, leading Investor Relations for the past 2 years. Trevor will now reassume the lead responsibilities for Investor Relations effective immediately. And with that, operator, let me open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is now live. Manav Patnaik : Thank you. Good morning. I appreciate and I applaud the de-risking of the mortgage. I just had a question around the incremental or decremental margins there. John maybe of the $0.50 EPS reduction, it sounds like $0.12 is from the Russia write-down. So is the remaining all on the mortgage side, I was just hoping you would help us understand that a bit. John Gamble : Yes. So, the remaining revenue decline of $100 million, right is the revenue decline offset by $75 million of non-mortgage growth, but it's all online, revenue decline. And Manav, as you know that we have very high mortgage \u2026 Mark Begor : In mortgage. John Gamble : \u2026 in mortgage, yes. But as you know, we have very high variable margins across online, online mortgage as well. So, it flows through and you can just do the math, right, it flows through it's something on the order of 60% is the -- what we brought forward. Manav Patnaik : Okay, got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then, Mark, maybe just on the talent side, some -- pretty impressive growth there. Can you just help us appreciate the volume or cyclicality to that business? Obviously, the labor market is hot. And so, the touches on that kind of data is good. Do you anticipate that slowing down? Or how should we think about the sensitivity there? Mark Begor : Yes, it's a great question, Manav. I think as you know, 75 million people a year change jobs, every year. It's a -- it's one that has some cyclicality, but there's an underlying base, it's very, very high. The growth that we're getting, though, is really from our penetration in the market, the new products we're rolling out, leveraging the work history we have in the 540 million records, where we have a resume for Manav of all the jobs you've had, so that work history is very valuable. And the kind of the macro change in talent is around speed, which we don't think is going to change, meaning hiring managers want to get that individual on the floor more quickly. That\u2019s always the case, even pre-pandemic and instant data that you can get from Equifax, work history data and now with incarceration data, we have medical credentialing data, we have the education data, and we're adding more datasets there allows the background screeners, which are our customers and other hiring businesses to really speed up their decisioning for the hiring manager. So, the bulk of the growth that we have there, and it's obviously, very, very strong, and we expect to continue is really putting these solutions together. And we've got more new products in the pipeline that we plan to bring out. We've talked with you before and others that, last year, we rolled out solutions that had more work history versus where does Mark work today with Equifax, where he work over the last 10 years. So those solutions we rolled out last year, and we're bringing those to the market. Those are really driving a lot of the top line growth. And then in 2022, we'll start combining some of the solutions like incarceration data with the work history, with education data to have a one click solution, and then we'll customize those around job categories. Because as you know, in each hiring process, the data that's used is different depend upon who you hire, a white-collar worker versus a banking employee versus a warehouse worker versus a truck driver or a dentist or a doctor. Those are all different data requirements, which is where we want to work towards productizing around families of jobs, which again, will make it easier for our customers to pull the data and then also results in higher revenue for Equifax because we're bringing more value to the space. The other point I would make out is we're increasingly driving system-to-system integrations here. You go back a couple years ago, like mortgage, the talent space was accessing a lot of our data through the web, through a manual web interface, meaning keying into the web and putting Mark's name in there and pulling down the data, moving the system-to-system, we get the same lift going forward. So, there's a lot of runway still with that going forward. So, it's a space that we like, it's a big space and one that we see a lot of potential going forward. Mark Begor : Just one thing to add, we can see the power of the historical records, because if you look at twin revenue excluding mortgage, take mortgage out of the mix, we're now seeing over 50% of the revenue include historical records. Manav Patnaik : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Thanks so much. Hey, I know you've talked about this a lot, but clearly you're outperforming the mortgage market pretty dramatically. Mark or John, can you bracket because it looks like the USIS will be down about 6% to 7% versus mortgage down 33%. Is there any way to think about just a couple of buckets of what's driving that relative outperformance just trying to frame it on a percentage basis, just to contextualize that a little bit more? Mark Begor : And Kevin, your question is around USIS in particular versus EWS? Kevin McVeigh : Yes, USIS if you want to open it up to EWS as well, it's fine. Mark Begor : Yes, maybe I'll start John. But there's a number of levers that we have to outperform all our underlying markets and you can use mortgage in particular, obviously, that gets more challenging when you talk about a mortgage market in the second half, that's going to be down 40%. But we've had strong outperformance for a long history. Workforce has more levers than USIS, but both businesses and I'll talk about USIS. One of their levers outperform underlying markets is price, increasing the price of the solution or the credit file and both Workforce Solutions and USIS have regular price increases that help them offset or increase their revenue depend upon where the markets going. The other is new products. Both businesses rollout new solutions. And Workforce Solutions has a lot more product opportunities than USIS, but USIS has had some new product rollouts to help them outgrow the underlying or in this case, in 2022, declining market. Third is going to be new customers. In USIS's case, that's really in their tri-merge business, growing some share there will grow their revenue. In Workforce Solutions, as you know, we only see 60% plus of mortgages still. 40% are done with manual paper pay stubs, we've been growing that. So, adding customers is a lever, or usage, if you will, is a lever. The other one both businesses have is the number of polls that happen in a transaction, and that's been growing in both USIS and in Workforce Solutions. Particularly as you see more digital interactions with consumers, which we would characterize as shopping, meaning consumers are shopping for mortgages and deciding which mortgage originator to work with in that shopping process, which is fairly new and more utilized in the last couple of years. And it's here to stay in our view, there's some data polled to qualify the customer. So, in the shopping process that mortgage originator can respond with some framework about the offer. So that's a place where number of polls, is another opportunity for the business. System-to-system integrations in USIS, it's virtually 100%, fully system-to-system. And Workforce Solutions, we've talked many times that of the 60% of mortgages, we see about 70% plus are system-to-system. We've been growing that, that's up, I think, 50% from where it was 3, 4 years ago. So, there's still opportunities versus web access. And in system-to-system we get a 20% lift in the number of polls. And then the last one that I touch on, it's really unique to Workforce Solutions is growing records. As you grow records, we have higher hit rates. Remember, in a system-to-system integration, or even a web access, our customers are coming to us for all of their mortgage applications or in their process. And when they do that, when we grow our records, which are up 19%, year-over-year in the first quarter for Workforce Solutions, that becomes revenue. We're able to monetize those additional records, which is why we're so focused on records. John Gamble : Hey, Kevin, if you're specifically just talking about USIS being down 6% to 7%, relative to the market being down 33.5% again, 6% to 7% are total revenue, right and the order of two-thirds of their revenue is non-mortgage. So, and we're seeing 6% to 8% growth in their B2B revenue, which is over half of their revenue, which is consistent with the long-term framework for USIS. And we're also expecting to see growth at a somewhat lower level, but growth in the consumer business that came over from GCS. So, it's those two -- the two-thirds of the business that's showing nice growth, that's offsetting the weaker mortgage market. And as Mark said, USIS is also outperforming the mortgage market. Kevin McVeigh : That helps. And then just real quick, John. What percentage of total Equifax is mortgage in kind of Q1 and then where do we think it'll end 2022? John Gamble : Yes, the Q1 was about 29.5%. And then as we move through the year, I think we'll get down to the point where we're just -- we're in the neighborhood of 21% to 22% as we get into the fourth quarter. Kevin McVeigh : Super. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Andrew Steinerman : Hi, John. On the mortgage percentages you just gave was that the U.S mortgage revenue or total mortgage revenues? I heard you mentioned mortgage in Canada today. My second question is, I know you like to look at core growth rates. I'm going to ask a question that's total. Could you tell us what the first quarter organic non-mortgage growth rate was? John Gamble : Okay. So the first question, the 29.6 is total, right. But Canada is very small. Mark Begor : It's really U.S. John Gamble : It's really driven by very, very small and we'll validate that to make sure, but I believe that's correct. And then in terms of core organic \u2026 Andrew Steinerman : No, no. I don't want to work core. I just want first quarter organic non-mortgage, total company. John Gamble : First quarter organic. So, I don't think that's a number we've disclosed, right, we give core organic, right. We gave organic for the business units. Mark Begor : And we give total. John Gamble : And we give total. Mark Begor : But certainly, one that -- we probably don't have in front of us here, Andrew, and we can look at getting that for you. Andrew Steinerman : Okay. Thanks so much. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Toni Kaplan : Thanks so much. Mark, I was hoping you could talk about what you're seeing in Europe. It seemed like this was a good quarter, in the first quarter, but was that more front end weighted? And just trying to think about how you're viewing it for the rest of the year? Mark Begor : Yes, we haven't seen any different. In Europe, for us, as you know, as U.K and Spain, which is really where we participate there. We're seeing a positive as the government and companies in the U.K., following the pandemic start to focus on some of the collections that were suspended during the pandemic timeframe. So that's kind of a positive for the business, which we expect to continue through 2022. And the underlying kind of credit businesses, we don't have kind of a mortgage issue. If you want the mortgage market macro in Europe, in our two countries, because we really don't participate in mortgage there. And it's really operating what you'd see in the non-mortgage business, here in the States, where it's pretty, pretty steady. And we see elements of kind of post-pandemic recovery, card issuers wanting to do marketing, wanting to rebuild their balance sheets, similar discussion around consumers, being fairly strong meaning employment is high, unemployment is low, which is kind of a good macro in those markets, same in Canada, Australia, and frankly, in Latin America, around the globe, people are working. So, outside of the interest rate environment, and then you can, as a result the inflation environment, the higher interest rates are going to attempt to offset. You see consumers that are working low unemployment, that have better balance sheets than they had coming into the COVID pandemic, because they got some stimulus spending, and of course, they're working. So, we're pretty optimistic for kind of the core portions of the business, and we're delivering that when you see the results. Toni Kaplan : Terrific, very helpful. And just thinking about mortgage in 2023, you talked about some of the decline that you were expecting in '23, you're pulling it forward into your '22 guidance. Are you thinking that 2023 sort of returns to what a normal level like we've been seeing -- that we saw on like 2015 to 2019? Or is there sort of more to go even beyond this year, just given the match of outperformance from prior -- the prior 2 years? Mark Begor : I think as John and I both mentioned, we tried to really stress kind of the mortgage market outlook. And let me be -- obviously transparent. This is a hard thing to forecast. We don't know where interest rates are going to go. It's pretty clear, they're going to go higher. We've never seen a Fed navigate an 8.5% inflation environment with full employment. That's a very tricky thing to do. So, it's probably hard to forecast. But what gave us comfort in de-risking, the outlook for 2022, which as you point out, and I did to that pulls forward what we thought would have been a more gradual return to normalization, until inflation heated up. We think that that's a pretty strong stress scenario from the way we looked at it. And as John pointed out, when you go back the past 5 to 10 years, pre-COVID, meaning -- and pre-COVID meaning is pre the refi run up when interest rates were slashed because of the COVID environment and refis really exploded. We're 25% below kind of a normal market when we exit the year. And really in the second half, that we think is kind of as low as it can go because when you think about the mortgage market, there's a steady purchase volume even in a recession. And this -- I don't know how to talk about what environment this is. It's certainly not a recession. But even in a recession people move. 40 million people a year move, they're buying houses, so there's a steady level of purchase volume. And then even in a rising interest rate environment, consumers do refis, particularly when they have some level of equity in their homes. And that's another calculus and looking at the way we tried to stress the mortgage environment and came up with our kind of down 40 in the second half is -- there's still a lot of home equity out there that's untapped. And doing cash out refi is even at higher interest rates is something you could see consumers do, and we've seen them do before. So, a bit long winded. But what we tried to do was really stress this in this uncertain environment to kind of is a darker mortgage environment as we could see. Toni Kaplan : Thanks so much. Helpful. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Kyle Peterson from Needham. Your company -- your line is now live. Kyle Peterson : Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I want to touch on kind of the performance in the non-mortgage business. Really impressive, especially given the mortgage headwinds. What do you guys think is the biggest driver behind that? Is it other credit products kind of performing better than expected? Or is it a share gain story? Or kind of what do you think is driving the upside on the non-mortgage side? Mark Begor : Yes, how much time do we have? We went through a lot of factors. I would start first with Workforce Solutions. Workforce Solutions, and we went through in real detail in our comments, non-mortgage businesses are very strong. And then, yes, I know you asked about non-mortgage, but even their ability start with growing records. Records up 19%, and the ability to continue to grow records, and their history of growing records, that puts a -- an element in the business, both mortgage and non-mortgage. Your question was around non-mortgage. So, as we grow records and what's unique about workforce is, we don\u2019t have all the records. And up 19% in the first quarter we've got three, now four larger kind of chunkier additions. Of course, we're doing M&A to add records through our Employer Services, business. So I would say that one unique element at Workforce. Certainly, our pricing power in Workforce and to a lesser degree in USIS allows us to outperform and drive non-mortgage growth. But then, as I talked about in the back half of my comments, some of the new verticals we're in where we're making acquisitions, or leveraging the cloud to roll out new products, like the talent space, or the government space, really strong growth rates they were delivering there. And then more broadly, Workforce, I think, is one which I talked about a bunch. The second is new products. Our new products are primarily a non-mortgage, because that's where most of our businesses, and that\u2019s where we're rolling them out. And a lot of our new products, as you know, are really leveraging our historical or multi data solutions. Whether it's in the talent space, instead of having a solution, that's where it is Mark worked today, which is what historically we had. Now we have, where did Mark work over the last 24 months, where at the last 36 months, in the last 48 months, the last 60 months. And we're going to add more different solutions there. Those are at higher price points. So that's driving the business. And we have commercial activity where we're out there winning share in USIS and of course, in EWS where we're just placing paper pay stubs that drives it. We talked about system-to-system integrations. I think the power of Equifax is we go through 2022 and into '23 and '24, is our differentiated data assets. It's the fact that we're really ramping NPIs, but we haven't finished the cloud. So, we're only in the early innings of really leveraging the cloud. That's going to come in the latter parts of '22 and '23. That's where we're really going to be able to drive that going forward. And I think you got a sense that taking up our guidance, really for the second time this year, around core growth, with most of that being driven by non-mortgage core growth, shows our confidence in the underlying strength of the company, which is our ability to bring new solutions to market, executing on our cloud transformation and really driving into some of these new markets, like identity and fraud, like talent, like government that have higher underlying growth rates than traditional FI credit bureau kind of markets. Kyle Peterson : That\u2019s helpful. And then just a quick follow-up on kind of your updated thoughts on capital allocation. You guys have given some pretty detailed thoughts at the Analyst Day in November. But I guess just given the higher rate environment of any -- the priorities in the near-term change between debt reduction or potential M&A or new product launches that will kind of help you diversify away from mortgage faster. Just want to see how you guys are thinking about it in this current environment? Mark Begor : Yes, so there's a couple of different questions there. First on our capital allocation, we were pretty clear at our Investor Day. We talked about it really in every earnings call, no change in that. First, we believe our free cash flow will continue to accelerate meaningfully through '22, and '23 and '24. And there's no change in what our free cash generation will be in 2022. We're still confident in that. And that free cash flow gives us a lot of flexibility, certainly around M&A. And as you know, we've done well over $3 billion of M&A in the last 15 months, all of that M&A has been oriented in kind of non-mortgage, if you want to use that term. But really in kind of core areas of Workforce Solutions, differentiated data that that's really been clearly our focus is to broaden Equifax. And you saw the slide that we put in the deck, again, that we had at Investor Day about our broader focus into faster growing markets. There -- we don't have competitors that talk about growing in the $2 billion government TAM. We don't have competitors that really talk about growing in the $4 billion talent TAM. I think they have focused on the identity and fraud, TAM that we're playing in, but really a clear focus there. And as our cash flow continues to accelerate, our priorities are certainly investing in Equifax, which we're doing through the cloud transformation. As you know, we're going to complete that, then that'll free up cash for us to invest more in new products going forward, which should drive our top line. But outside of investing in CapEx, we still view M&A as an important way to do bolt on acquisitions to strengthen the core of Equifax, really discipline around where we want to do it to strengthen the core of workforce, differentiated data, or identity and fraud. But then there's going to be excess free cash flow from Equifax. And as our EBITDA continues to grow, as we go through '23 and '24, we're going to delever the company. And at the right time, we'll certainly look at returning some of that cash to shareholders through buyback, or through increasing our dividend. We're not ready to do that today, but we are clear in our Investor Day that that's a -- kind of that balance of how we think about a capital allocation framework going forward against the backdrop of a significant increase in both our free cash flow going forward and our leverage available -- cash flow available from leverage as we grow our EBITDA. Kyle Peterson : That's helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ashish Sabadra from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks for taking my question. Mark, I just wanted to go back to the comments that you made about the health of the consumer balance sheet being really healthy, which makes sense. But one of the concerns is that the higher fuel prices inflation, there may be some cracks in the low to mid income consumers, which could potentially weigh on consumer lending. Maybe in the back half of the year. I was just wondering, based on your conversations with the banks, have they indicated any slowdown there, or any color on that front around the state of the consumer itself? Mark Begor : Yes, we haven't seen it. And our looks are we don't expect to see it based on what we see 2022 unfolding. Certainly, inflation is a real challenge, fuel prices, food prices, et cetera. 8.5% is very, very high inflation. Some states in the U.S are above 10%. But at the same time, people are working, wages are up meaningfully for a lot of wage categories. So that's a positive. And when I talk about their balance sheet, it's really over the last 2 years, they couldn't spend much because we were in the COVID pandemic lockdown. And there was a lot of stimulus, which is still out there. There's still a lot of stimulus coming from -- and again, I'm talking about the U.S government. While they're not individual payments, a lot of the social services payments, some of the requirements have been suspended. You've seen the administration talking about pausing on student debt collections that helps balance sheets for a lot of consumers that are working out there, and they're very low unemployment. And then when we talk to the banks, and you've seen some of their numbers in the last couple of weeks, like use credit card originations, up 10% -- I'm sorry, credit card usage up 10% and the bank's balance sheets declined during COVID. So, you've got very strong customers, meaning in our financial institutions that need to grow their balance sheets, and you've got what I would still argue is a fairly strong consumer, because of the wage inflation and the fact they're working and you add to stimulus, is balancing out the inflation, but it's certainly something you will continue to watch going forward. Ashish Sabadra : That's very helpful color, Mark. That\u2019s very helpful. And then maybe just on the USIS non-mortgage B2B business. The improvement that is expected from the first quarter to second quarter obviously you provided a lot of good color. I was just wondering how much of it is coming from just volume growth at your existing customers, but also from customers going -- sorry, accessing alternate data sets as well as potential new events? So, I was wondering if you could comment on those two, the new wins, the pipeline there as well as the demand? Obviously, we've continued to see greater demand for alternate data. But are you seeing more of that in the near-term? Thanks. Mark Begor : Yes, for sure. Just again on USIS, we were quite pleased with their core online business. It was up really -- slightly above or at our expectations on the online piece, which is comes from either market share gains, or new solutions that we're delivering that deliver the online. The piece that USIS didn't deliver on within their batch, or account management, review business, there was really just some timing in March, and some of those deals closed in April. And so we expect USIS to continue moving their growth going forward in the second quarter through the rest of the year in non-mortgage. And we are seeing some good wins in the marketplace, both with the market share gains we expect from being cloud native, providing stronger stability, those are going to continue to be a positive for the USIS commercial team going forward. And as you point out, our increasing focus on alternative data in our single data cloud fabric is another positive and we're seeing definite traction around the use of alternative data. All of our customers are looking for new data solutions to help them drive originations. And when you add some of the unique data assets that we have, which we believe we have at scale, more -- much more than our competitors, those are the kinds of solutions that the USIS team are bringing to market through our new products that we're rolling out. John Gamble : And just some color on just USIS online in the first quarter non-mortgage, our FI business was up over 10%. So that was good growth. We saw auto and insurance up high single digits, again, very good growth. And as Mark mentioned in the script, Kount was up almost 50%, which is identity and fraud. So we feel good about the way the online business was trending [multiple speakers] covered, yes. Ashish Sabadra : Sorry about that. Yes, thanks. Mark Begor : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Hamzah Mazari from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Hamzah Mazari : Good morning. Good morning. Thank you. My first question is just on Workforce Solutions. Maybe if you could update us or just walk us through the ability to take some of the products we have in the U.S and bring them to international markets? Is every international market sort of available to you to penetrate around Workforce Solutions? Or sort of just walk us through which markets are more penetrated versus others? Is it an early innings today? Mark Begor : Yes, it definitely early innings. We see kind of global market opportunity. As you may recall, pre our cloud transformation, we launched Workforce Solutions businesses in Australia, Canada and in India. We paused on doing any more international rollouts until we got our cloud stack in place for Workforce. And then about a few months ago -- actually a month and a half ago, we announced our entry into the U.K., where we have our cloud stack in there. And we're starting to onboard records from companies and partners in the U.K. So those are the four markets we're in today. We're definitely intending and looking to grow in other markets in the future. And even in markets where we don't do business, meaning we don't have Credit Bureau businesses. As you know, we're in 25 countries outside the United States, but we see the opportunity. And you think about some of the leverage points we have. Number one is our cloud stack, meaning our infrastructure. We spent hundreds of millions of dollars building this and now we can just move it very easily into a new market. Second is our existing customer or contributor relationships if you're a big multinational company, like a GE and IBM, pick a big industrial company, a bank that's doing global business, and there's a bunch of those in the United States. If we're doing the income and employment verification for them here, they liked the idea of us doing it for them in all their global markets. So that's a kind of an opportunity to load records and add in those different markets. And then last is payroll partners that we have. As you know, we've got a substantial number of them on an exclusive basis, most of them are exclusive. And same thing, a handful of those in the U.S are global. And we already have the connections, the pipes, the relationships with them here in the States. So, the ability to do the same thing globally is a leverage point for us. So, you should look for us to do more. In the scheme of Equifax, or Workforce, what's going to move the needle is more of the U.S levers that Workforce has over the next 2, 3, 4, 5 years, but you would expect us to, and we are, investing in some of these longer-term opportunities outside the United States, like the U.K expansion that we did a few weeks ago. Hamzah Mazari : Got it. And just my follow-up question is just around the cloud transformation. I think you said half of your revenue is on the cloud. Maybe if you could talk about, and maybe you mentioned this already, but just timing of when the other 50% of revenue comes on the cloud and just related to the cloud, the cost savings are baked into your 2022 guide. What is that number again, that's baked in around cost savings? Thank you. Mark Begor : Sure. I'll start and let, John, jump in. So, at year-end, we had about 50% of Equifax revenue in the new Equifax cloud. We talked about that in our February call. By the end of this year, 2022, we expect to have substantially completed North America, which is U.S and Canada, all of that in the cloud. So that'll be a big jump for us. And as you know, the United States for us revenue wise is approaching 80% of Equifax. And then International, some of the international markets, we won't complete until '23 and there might be some migrations that will complete in 2024. So that's really our runway around -- completing the cloud. And I'll let John jump on the actual cost savings. But as you know, we had some cost savings last year, a bigger number this year, they continue in '23 and they're likely be some in 2024. But they're all embedded in our 500 basis point margin expansion between now and 2025. I think on Investor Day, we talked about half of those roughly being from the cloud. So, if there's any change in that, and John can talk a little bit about the actual numbers. John Gamble : Yes. So, what we talked about in the past, right, is that we -- in terms of transformation investments, as you went from '21 to '22, that you would see savings and investments, net of new product development reinvestment [indiscernible] the order of $40 million to $50 million. That's still correct, we're still moving forward with that. We also indicated that we would see net cloud savings as we move through 2022. And as Mark said, those were embedded in the margin guidance we gave. We didn't give specific dollar values. But the net cloud savings will be delivering this year as more and more moves on to the cloud. A cloud native infrastructure is embedded in the guidance that we gave, the updated guidance today is for up 125 basis points in 2022 relative to 2021. Hamzah Mazari : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners. Your line is now live. Craig Huber : Yes, good morning. Thank you. My first question, maybe give us a flavor of the new products that you've rolled out that you're excited about here in the U.S? Let's start there, please. Mark Begor : Oh, my gosh, how much time do we have? We talk about it in every call we have. There's a bunch. And I would really focus them in a couple of buckets. First is Workforce Solutions. We talked about this before. If you go back a couple of years, Workforce Solutions products they deliver to market were generally around a snapshot of where does someone work today and how much did they make, and a bunch of attributes, but they were really time based and current. And so, one of the big changes we've been able to do as a result of the cloud is really leverage those historical records. And whether it's looking at someone's income and employment over a long timeframe in a mortgage application, or looking at their work history, in the hiring or talent space that trended or time-based data, historical data is incredibly valuable and was very difficult to do pre the cloud transformation. So that's been a big change. And those products are really solving a lot of our customers problems. Our customers needed more than just where does Mark work today for certain consumers, that -- if they have a -- if you're a sales commissioned employee, my income today might not reflect my annual income because I get my bonus in February. So having that 12 months data is incredibly valuable, and we can sell it at a higher price point, using the example of a Workforce Solutions that we would sell at $30, $40, $50 per pole for kind of where does Mark work today, that historical data we're able to bring to the marketplace because of its value to our customers at $150, $135, $200. So, I would say that's a very powerful element of the cloud transformation that allows us to bring new solutions to market. And more broadly, Workforce Solutions, because they're further down the path in the cloud. They're really taking advantage of that, rolling new products out. And I think we talked like in the talent space, we added the 24 -- the 12 month, 24, 48-month work history for some jobs, the hiring manager wants to see more history, those were at higher price points. But we're now going to move to productizing around job category. Meaning if you're a warehouse worker, you're going to need certain types of data, we're going to we're going to develop a one click solution to deliver all that data for that kind of job and that employee. And then someone who's a white-collar worker, is going to have more education data that has to be a part of that poll and other data elements. So that's kind of where we're going product wise. The other bucket, I would say that we're excited about is multi data solutions. And that's really driven by our single data fabric, which is very unique to Equifax. WE had siloed datasets, our competitors have siloed datasets, we're going to a single data fabric, and the ability to combine data, think about the credit file, combined with our cell phone utility payment data, our wealth data, different data elements, the cloud allows us to do that. And that's something that our customers want that alternative data because it drives higher predictability, but it's difficult for them to absorb in pieces. And that's why we're going to serve it up in a single data fabric and then in product solutions, where we combine it together. So, I'd say that's the other bucket of solutions. And then the last is just we're in just different verticals today. You go back a couple, 3 years ago, we were primarily in financial services, bringing new solutions, like I9 anywhere to our Employer Services business, where we're delivering solutions, compliance solutions to HR managers, or as we talked about in talent or government, those are just faster growing markets. And very different than our core FI or Credit Bureau space that you're really energizing. And, of course, the focus we have on it. We've added a bunch of resources in, really '19, '20 and '21. I have a direct report to my leadership team. My leadership team, it's our Chief Product Officer. And then the cloud really gives us a lot of leverage to bring those new products to market. Craig Huber : That's great. My other question is in -- what is embedded in your outlook for the rest of the year for the U.S for autos, credit cards and personal loans? I mean, you gave us some good data there, how it did in the first quarter. Are you expecting that this significantly slow the rest of the year, given the higher interest rate environment? How are you sort of think about those three categories for the rest of the year? Thank you. Mark Begor : Yes, we don't see any change in those categories in 2022, already had some comments around the consumer. And we don't think the higher interest rates will impact that in cards or -- autos impacted today by supply shortages. We're dealing with that and the market is, I'm not sure when that's going to be resolved. That's more of an inventory issue, but the underlying consumer and the underlying customer of ours that's trying to grow their financing businesses. We don't see any change from where we were a few months ago. Craig Huber : That's it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Simon Clinch from Atlantic Equities. Your line is now live. Simon Clinch : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. It's kind of -- maybe a difficult one to answer. But I was thinking about the pace of outperformance that we've seen from the mortgage revenues in EWS over the last several years, can we learn anything from that and use that as a guide to how we should think about the outperformance or the growth? Has the non-mortgage verification services business really started to take off? As in, should we expect a much faster pace of growth initially at the outset, maybe even faster, because you've got even more records now. And then perhaps a faster normalization, as -- I guess a more compressed cycle, before you get to a more normal sort of level of outgrowth there. Mark Begor : Yes, that's a complex question, Simon. Let me talk about a couple of things. The one thing that I always start with, and I know you do too, it's very unique about Workforce Solutions is the ability to grow their assets, their data assets, meaning their twin records and drive revenue growth. And we talked before, when you think about 19% revenue growth in the first quarter, that was -- they were up roughly 19% for the year, last year. We've already got a pipeline of additional records, those records translate into revenue, just because we have the system-to-system integrations, and it just takes our hit rates up. So, that's kind of a base element of their ability to outperform their underlying markets, because you're adding records. And then you add on top of that, the ability to roll out new products, drive system-to-system integrations, all of those that we've talked about drive penetration, drive usage, those are all become levers for them to drive their top line growth. And on top of that, when you talk about non-mortgage, as you know, they're operating in some underlying macro markets, whether it's talent, or the government space, that are just growing strongly. These are kind of 20% type, high double-digit growth type markets that help fuel their non-mortgage growth of Workforce Solutions. And I think, an Investor Day we talked about a 13% to 15%, long-term revenue growth rate for the business. Obviously, they outgrew that in the first quarter, they're going to outgrow that in 2022. They outgrew that in '20 and 2021. So, we see a lot of momentum in the business going forward, a lot of levers for growth going forward. Simon Clinch : Okay. That's helpful. And just as a follow-up, I mean, when we're just going back to mortgages. Just kind of curious to the comments made that you're now bringing your inquiry guide -- inquiry guidance, kind of in line with the outlooks provided by the NBA and Fannie Mae. Whereas previously, I can assume that you weren't doing that. And I was just kind of curious as to the reasons why you weren't using those sort of more public forecasts, what you saw on your numbers that made you more, more positive in those outlooks and why now it's time to go to the more extreme outlooks. When you said yourself that you're nowhere near those trends at this point. Mark Begor : Yet, so just two things. First, I think what you would have seen over the past several months is obviously NBA, Fannie, Freddie have also substantially changed their outlooks, given the main ticket taking them down, given the significant increase in interest rates. And what we've been doing over the past several years, I think, which we've been very open about as we've been taking a look at the markets based on the run rate trends that we have in our own business, because we can see inquiries. And what we started to see and the reason we made the change we did is because we're starting to see that the inquiry trends that we were, that we can measure, were starting to decline more rapidly. So, as we took a look at the information we had, and the analysis we could do, we believe we're headed toward the type of the down 40% that we talked about, which as we do, the analysis, we now see is consistent with where NBA and Fannie are, but we think the analysis we've done and the analysis they've done are just more consistent to those point in time. John Gamble : I would add to point that, we talked about it a couple times this morning. But that kind of second half, fourth quarter run rate for the mortgage market that's underlying our new guide, its 25% below the kind of normal markets pre the COVID pandemic. And that's a pretty strong stress, and that was our -- intent was to put something that is it's very uncertain, how far interest rates going to go, how's the Fed really going to tame inflation, which they've never done before at this level with employment at this level. And that's why we decided to do a really strong de-risk of the underlying mortgage market, but then also have a lot of transparency about how the rest of Equifax is operating. Our strong core growth and actually stronger for this -- we took our guidance up for the rest of Equifax for the second time this year. Simon Clinch : Okay, excellent. Well, thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Andrew Nicholas from William Blair. Your line is now live. Andrew Nicholas : Hi. Thank you and good morning. I wanted to spend my two questions on some updates in terms of recent M&A. Maybe I'll start with Kount. I think twice now you mentioned the 50% Plus or 50%-ish growth in that business seems pretty, pretty meaningfully higher than I think the 20% growth that was originally expected when you knocked the deal early last year. So, if you could spend some time kind of talking about what's going right in that business where the momentum is, and the extent to which that growth is, is based on synergies from the Equifax relationships or the Equifax business, or if it's just continued momentum in that area, broadly, both of those would be interesting topics, I think, to cover. Mark Begor : Yes, so we are very bullish about the space first, identity and fraud and we're really energized about the team, the leader that we brought in, it's driving that business, and it's in a space that's growing rapidly. It's a digital macro is very, very strong. Their underlying growth is a big part of that. There's some elements of synergies, but I would say that those are more on the com, meaning some of the product solutions of combining Kount and Equifax data, we are more second half oriented, it's just a really strong execution, and they have a great product. We've added more resources in the business, I think the headcount in the business is up something like 20% or 30%, maybe it's more like that 30%, since we acquired the business. So, we're putting more feet on the street, we've got a new commercial leader, that's really partnering with the CEO that was the founder of the business that we really like a lot. We've also given the CEO responsibility for our full identity and for our business, so he was running Kount, during the 2021, early this year. He's now got responsibility for the whole business, and we think it will have a big impact there and really drive the synergies going forward. So, we're quite bullish about their market position, their pipeline, but it really starts with a space that's very good. And we bought a very attractive business that we're making stronger. Andrew Nicholas : That's helpful. Thank you. And then maybe a similar question on afterwards. I think, Mark, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned, new customer wins as being part of the growth driver in the first quarter. Same sort of question is, is that from Equifax relationships, or just the momentum of the business? And then maybe relatedly, are there any kind of big picture learnings from kind of having integrated that business, we're beginning to integrate that business over the past couple of months that you're already applying within the talent solutions market? Or Sure, the sectors in which it exists? Thank you. Mark Begor : Yes, so great questions. First, on the Appriss business, another great business. I was there last week in Louisville, where they're headquartered with the team. We got a great leader there, and a great team, and the growth they're delivering is primarily from their own momentum. We only acquired them in October, so they're only a few months in. We're in the throes of integrating and bringing them into our technology and a cloud data fabric and the other elements on it. It's another space. So, they're winning new state contracts, they didn't have that were in their pipeline, when we acquired them, and just executing and the synergies that we're counting on, will really start kicking in the second half and '23, and probably likely into 2024. And we really liked the unique data. The criminal justice data that they have is very, very unique. And the instant decisioning from the talent space, plays in their world. And then, of course, in social services, it's also used. As part with regards to lessons learned, I sure wouldn't want to be doing these number of acquisitions if we weren't the cloud. It's -- it would be very hard to integrate these with the pace that we're going to be doing it. If we were still in our legacy environment, and that gives us a lot of confidence around doing acquisitions. And we're always learning about how we can do the integrations, more effectively, and -- but we've got some pretty good muscle around that, because it's not new for us. We've been doing acquisitions for a long time. Long before I joined 4 years ago, at Equifax, but we're getting better at it, I think and always looking to improve it. But the cloud gives us a lot of confidence, when doing M&A and I hope you agree that we're being very disciplined around the kind of businesses we want to buy. Our criteria and M&A is very clear. We want to grow, we want to buy businesses that are growing faster than Equifax. So, they're accretive to our growth rates. Mark Begor : We want to buy businesses that are going to deliver margin accretion with Equifax. And most importantly, we want to buy businesses that strengthen the core of Equifax, whether it's around differentiated data, or around the Employer Services business as you point out. If you look at all of our acquisitions, they're checking those boxes. And then of course, identity and fraud, around Kount is just a space we'd like to get larger in and if you look at our acquisition so far this year, efficient higher, it makes us stronger in that. Employers Solutions space that, we want to be bigger in but also delivers more records to the Workforce Solutions businesses, they add new customers. Andrew Nicholas : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from George Mihalos from Cowen. Your line is now live. George Mihalos : Great. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. Two quick ones. And I'll ask them upfront. Just first, a point of clarification, Mark and John on FMS. It sounds again, like it was just sort of a timing issue. You've got good visibility now in the second quarter. Your outlook has not changed at all for the year within that segment. And you maybe just kind of remind us how you're thinking about growth for FMS on a full year basis. And then secondarily, the $75 million of outperformance, if you will, from the core that's offsetting some of these mortgage headwinds, is that essentially all EWS and as you talked about some NPI benefits as well coming in, but is there any part of that outperformance that ties into USIS? And if so, what verticals or areas are performing ahead of your expectation? Thanks, guys. Mark Begor : I'll do the second one, John and you could take the first one on FMS, which is an easy one, but under $75 million, the bulk of that for sure is Workforce Solutions. But International is also a piece of that. Internationals performing exceptional. USIS I think, is kind of aligned with where we started the year, we don't see any change. They're performing very, very well. The outperformance is a piece of that is from international, but the bulk is Workforce and it's all the levers we talked about on the call this morning. John Gamble : And in terms of non-mortgage really in USIS and we still expect them to perform in 6% to 8%, right. So, we believe in total non-mortgage which is both the online and the FMS portions, should still deliver in that 6% to 8% range, George. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Heather Balsky : Hi, thank you for taking my question. I'm just curious [indiscernible] EWS is easy taught you. You maintained your outlook for 30% outperformance versus the mortgage market. I'd love to get your thoughts in a sort of, I guess worse than expected mortgage market environment sort of your confidence in sort of that outperformance kind of why it's not one for one or and also your ability to take price and sell premium products in this type of environment. Thanks. Mark Begor : Yes, there's a number of levers there on the drives the Workforce Solutions outperformance broadly in all their markets, but we'll focus your question on mortgage. So, start with records. We have pretty good visibility around our record growth in we talked about the fact that we were up 19 in the first quarter. We talked about -- we've got three now four larger payroll processors coming online in 2022. So, as you know, that record growth translates into higher hit rates and revenue. So, that's kind of a big piece of that. Second is price. We did our -- we do our pricing actions late in the year, they go into effect in January and their effect through the year. So, we know what our prices on a year-over-year basis. That's pretty well nailed down. The new product rollouts, you saw our momentum in Workforce Solutions with our mortgage products that we rolled out in 2021. Those were rolled out during the year. We get the full year benefit of those, many of them are rolled out in the third and fourth quarter. So, we have kind of visibility on the take rate and the usage of those because they're solving specific solutions. So, we have pretty good visibility around that. There's visibility around customer wins that we're bringing online. Remember, 60% of mortgages are still done in paper pay stubs. We have visibility around system-to-system integrations that we're working with customers that are not system-to-system, they're web based. There's another element of visibility, around that element. And then, we have trended data around how often the twin datasets being pulled? As you know that's increased in recent years to two polls. We don't see any change in that. So, that's kind of in the [indiscernible]. What did I miss John, as far as our visibility? John Gamble : I think you've covered it right. Plus, the fact is we were down, market was down 25% in the first quarter. And they outperformed by approaching 30% or 27%, right. So, we feel like even in a down market, we've already seen similar to the down markets we saw late last year, they perform very, very well. We know it's much deeper as we go forward. But as Mark said, the big driver is records and penetration, which they continue to deliver on. Heather Balsky : Great. Thank you. And as a follow-up on the integration, you mentioned how much of your revenue is coming from system-to-system integrations? I'm curious, sort of on a penetration basis in the mortgage business. Kind of where you are in a customer bases and where you think it can go. Mark Begor : And that's -- your questions around what portion of our mortgage customers are in the cloud environment? I'm not sure I heard it, right. Heather Balsky : Sorry, the system-to-system integrations that you talked. Mark Begor : Yes, yes, sorry. Hey, Heather, I think actually what we're going to post the deck here in about an hour or two, and on that there'll be an update to that number. So great. Thank you. 11 o'clock. Sorry about that. Yes. Heather Balsky : Thanks. Great. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jeff Meuler from Baird. Your line is now live. Jeff Meuler : Yes, thank you. Just one for me. Want to see if you're willing to share any data around NPI uptake for clients that have completed their migration to your data cloud? It sounds like you have enough of the client base migrated at this point that we would start to have some data if that's seeing an explicit acceleration at NPI uptake or not. So, we'd love any data points on it. Thank you. Mark Begor : That's a great question, Jeff. One that I don't have and John shaking his head also that he doesn't have, but it's one that I'm going to run down. I definitely want understand it. I think intuitively we find it there's some list there, but let us run it down. John Gamble : And given that the percentage of products that we're delivering are substantially above half as we talked about that are running on the new cloud infrastructure. I would expect it's probably a pretty good number. Jeff Meuler : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Your line is now live. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi. Thank you very much for squeezing me in over here. Mark, you mentioned when there was a question about some of the levers in USIS to offset mortgage, one of the things you mentioned was price. I don't usually hear that too much in USIS. I hear that much more about, the work number and things like that. Is there -- is there a consistent pricing uplift every year, like you get in other parts of the market of your business? Or is there pushback from clients over there, maybe you can just kind of touch on that a little bit. Mark Begor : I would say there's always pushback from clients when it comes to price. But we've been very clear, and we probably more often talk about price at Workforce Solutions, because they just have more pricing power. They're just more unique data asset than our -- than the credit file. But USIS, pretty regularly does price increases, meaning on an annual basis. And there's some element of price there, but it's not at the same scale, or leverages our workforce. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. So, there's consistent price lift, even though -- even on the basic credit file type stuff is what you're saying. Mark Begor : In particularly a mortgage. Yes, that's a place where we have historically done kind of consistent price increases in USIS. In some of the other verticals, we may take price up, but then have concessions that happen. So, the pricing power is not as strong, in some of the other verticals. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Got it. And then one of the things that this is kind of a competitive type question, but one of the things I have heard out in the market is that there's competitors trying to get in terms of building their own databases, excuse me for income information, but you are incenting clients to keep Equifax at the top of the waterfall. And I'm wondering, like, how do you go about doing that if someone else was coming in with a lower price point? Mark Begor : Yes. Your question is more around customers versus obtaining records or is it both? Shlomo Rosenbaum : No, it's really like -- if you have a customer that can potentially use a much less effective database, but at a much lower price point, right. So, the strategy from the competitor is to go ahead and say use us first and then if you can't get it at the lower price, then move on to Equifax. So, I've heard from some customers that Equifax is aware of that obviously has some kind of strategy where you can incent the customer to keep Equifax at the top of the waterfall and I was just wondering how that works. Mark Begor : Yes, I guess, our view of the marketplace is that our solution in the verticals we participate in for income and employment data is, price competitively meaning there, there aren\u2019t what we see in posted market prices, we don't see prices that are lower than Equifax. So, I don't think there's a price advantage there. What we do with some customers, when we tap top of waterfall, it's really to have them hit our database in a system-to-system basis versus doing manual efforts. So we've had some commercial incentives to move customers from doing manual searches around income and employment data to hit Equifax first. And part of that is, is that we've really had a very significant increase in our coverage over the last couple, 3 years. You go back, 3-years ago, we were below 50%. Now we're at 65%, approaching 70%. So, it was really more -- some commercial incentives to get customers to understand that they can get a hit very quickly from Equifax, but we haven't seen, what you described as, us having to commercially get in front of someone else who has a different solution to Equifax. Operator : Okay. John Gamble : Because there really aren't any other solutions at scale. John Gamble : Right now, I mean, pre-realistic [multiple speakers]. I know they're small, but I mean, some of those, that's what I was talking about -- some of them being out there. And they are very small, but that's how they're trying to get tested into the marketplace. And so, I was wondering about that. Mark Begor : And again, we haven't seen any commercial pressure from that. They're very, very small. And it would surprise us that a customer would want to change a waterfall, [indiscernible] the system effort involved in the very low hit rates, and again, there's not a pricing advantage or cost advantage for [indiscernible]. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live. Faiza Alwy : Great. Thank you and good morning. I just, I know we've covered a lot of ground. But I just wanted to ask about EWS EBITDA margins, because just given the strong growth that you're seeing on the top line, I would have expected a little bit more flow through on the margin side. And I know you've talked about acquisitions, but I was hoping for a bit more color, maybe you can give us what organic margins were in that business, or if there's like a mix impact as it relates to various verticals, like are the new products at a lower margin. Just a little bit more color around how we should think about the drivers of margins there. John Gamble : Yes, so we had really nice margin improvement, right, from fourth to first. And we are and we are certainly incurring some of the impact from the recent acquisitions, which the acquired businesses generally just want to have margins that are as accretive as ours. So, you are seeing that in the first quarter. We don't really disclose an inorganic and organic EBITDA margin, but we feel very good about almost 55% margins that we're seeing. And we think it's really an outstanding performance, we indicated. I think we expect them to be 54% for the full year. So, we feel very good about the trend in EWS margins, and obviously they are investing in new products to drive faster growth. So, we certainly encourage that. But we think operating at this range of 54% to 55% margins is outstanding. Faiza Alwy : Okay. So, there's no mix impacts that we should think about by vertical or product? John Gamble : We certainly have different margin levels for different products. Generally speaking, most of the Verifier products have relatively similar margins. There are different margin profiles between Verifier and Employer. But again -- I think generally speaking, 54% to 55% margins very, very strong. We feel very good about them. Faiza Alwy : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further closing comments. Mark Begor : We just wanted to thank everyone for participating. If you have more questions, please reach out to Investor Relations. John Gamble : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to Trevor Burns, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Trevor Burns : Thanks, and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Trevor Burns. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the IR Calendar section of the News & Events tab at our IR website, www.investor.equifax.com. During the call, we will be making reference to certain materials that can also be found in the Presentations section of the News & Events tab at our IR website. These materials are labeled Q2 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Also, we will be making reference, certain forward-looking statements, including third quarter and full year 2022 guidance to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors that may impact our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2021 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. We will also be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and can be found in the Financial Results section of the Financial Info tab at our IR website. Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark, beginning on slide four. Mark Begor : Thanks, Trevor, and good morning. Equifax delivered another solid quarter with record second quarter revenue of $1.32 billion, which was up 7% and at the middle of our April guidance, including the negative impact of 190 basis points or $23 million of FX. Constant currency revenue growth was almost 9% at 8.5%. Adjusted EPS of $2.09 was above the top end of our April guidance range with U.S. mortgage market overall, about at the level of our April guidance with U.S. mortgage credit inquiries down 33% versus last year. As expected, the mortgage market decline increased as we moved through the quarter. In the first half of July, mortgage credit inquiries were down about 40% versus last year. Core revenue growth in the quarter of 19% and core organic revenue growth of 16% in the quarter were very strong. Consistent with our expectations, which allowed us to deliver the 8.5% constant currency growth against a 33% U.S. mortgage market decline. Importantly, non-mortgage constant currency growth of 22% was very strong in the quarter and well above our 8% to 12% long-term framework and of course, this represents about 75% of Equifax revenue. Workforce Solutions core revenue growth of 41% was outstanding and above our expectations. International delivered 11.5%, constant currency growth, which was also above our expectations. And USIS B2B non-mortgage growth of 6% was up from first quarter, but lower than we expected. B2B non-mortgage online was strong at 9%. However, our B2B offline business was much weaker than expected, declining 5% in the quarter, and I'll cover this more fully shortly. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $461 million, up 7% and adjusted EBITDA margins of 35% were above in line with our expectations for the quarter. We continue to make strong progress during the quarter on our EFX Cloud data and technology transformation. Year-to-date, we've migrated approximately 14,500 customers to the cloud in the U.S. And since the start of the transformation, we now have migrated about 70% of our U.S. customers. So far in 2022, we also migrated approximately 13,000 international customers and decommissioned four U.S. data centers. Leveraging our new EFX Cloud infrastructure, we continue to invest in new product resources and accelerate new product innovations. So far in 2022, we released 50 -- over 50 new products continuing momentum from 2021 where we launched a record 151 new products. In the quarter, our Vitality index, defined as revenue from new products introduced in the last three years was extremely strong and exceeded 13%. This is over a 400 basis point improvement from our 9% Vitality last year and the highest level in over 10 years at Equifax. For 2022, we expect Vitality of over 11% and which is 100 basis points above our 10% long-term Vitality goal and 100 basis points above the framework when we started the year. This strong NPI performance will benefit our growth in the second half and in 2023 and beyond. We continue to invest our strong free cash flow and strategic bolt-on acquisitions with the acquisition of LawLogix that we announced earlier this morning, which will further strengthen our EWS Employer Solutions I-9 integration regulatory service capabilities. This is our sixth acquisition in Workforce Solutions since January 2021 and aligned with our M&A strategy to strengthen workforce, our largest and fastest-growing business. Bolt-on acquisitions that broaden and strengthen Equifax are a strong lever for future growth and are central to our long-term growth framework to add 100 to 200 basis points to our revenue growth annually from strategic bolt-on M&A. We are very pleased with our strong second quarter results, particularly our strong 22% non-mortgage constant currency growth. This is clearly an unprecedented economic environment with record inflation, strong set actions and the impact from higher interest rates on the mortgage market. Despite our strong first half performance we felt it was prudent to adjust our 2022 guidance to reflect expectations for further weakening of the U.S. mortgage market in the second half beyond the framework we provided in April as well as the significant negative impact of FX from the stronger dollar. Importantly, our expectations for 2022 core revenue growth remains a very strong 17%. Our expectation for constant currency non-mortgage revenue growth remains a very strong 19%, both unchanged from our April guidance. While our second quarter mortgage results were aligned with our April guidance, we thought there was enough uncertainty between future Fed actions, the impact on interest rates and mortgage activity to further adjust our second half mortgage outlook. Our updated expectations for mortgage are that credit inquiries will decline by over 46% in the second half, which is down about 600 basis points from our April framework with mortgage originations declining 200 to 300 basis points beyond these levels. This compares to the Mortgage Bankers Association forecast for the second half of 2022 mortgage origination units of down 43.5% that was released last night. As you know, USIS mortgage revenue is tied more closely to credit inquiries, while Workforce Solutions revenue is tied more closely to mortgage originations. And for the second half of 2022, FX is a headwind of over $40 million up from an impact of about $7 million in our April guidance from the stronger dollar. The change in the second half mortgage inquiries and FX impact results in our revised 2022 guidance for revenue at the midpoint of $5.1 billion down $100 million from our April framework, but still up almost 4% versus last year or 5% on a constant currency basis. This reduction in revenue is about two-thirds related to mortgage with the balance from FX. Our updated adjusted EPS guidance is to a midpoint of $7.68, down $0.47 from our April guidance and up about 1% from 2021. As I said earlier, there's no change in our core organic revenue growth framework, which remains a very strong 15% for 2022 and 13% in the second half of 2022, and our non-mortgage growth framework remains up a strong 16% for the year and 12% in the second half as we comp-off some strong double-digit results in the second half of 2021 and in the second half of 2021. In the second half of 2022, non-mortgage is about 80% of Equifax revenue consistent with 2019 and up from 68% last year. Turning to slide five, in the second quarter, Equifax core revenue growth, the green section of the bars, grew a very strong 19%, which was in line with our expectations and substantially above our long-term financial framework of eight to 12. Core organic revenue growth of 16% in the quarter was also substantially above the long-term framework of 7% to 10% for organic growth. Non-mortgage organic growth in EWS International and USIS drove about 12 points of core organic revenue growth in the quarter. Core mortgage outperformance of 13%, predominantly in Workforce Solutions drove the remaining 4% of second quarter core organic revenue growth. Both were very strong performances. With a strong 19% core growth in the quarter and accelerating NPI rollouts, we continue to expect 2022 core revenue growth of 17%. This is driven by broad-based strong performance across Workforce Solutions as well as strength in USIS non-mortgage B2B online and international, which is supported by our accelerated new product introductions. As detailed on slide six, U.S. core mortgage revenue growth in the quarter was up a strong 13% driven by Workforce Solutions core mortgage revenue growth of 20% and 2% in USIS. Second quarter mortgage revenue was down only 19% despite the 33% decline in the overall U.S. mortgage market as measured by our credit inquiries and an MBA June estimated decline in mortgage originations of about 37%. Workforce Solutions core mortgage growth of 20% continues to be driven by very strong performance on TWN record additions, new products and pricing, system and system integrations and continued penetration. The 20 points of market outperformance is very strong, particularly in a period of declining market transaction volumes. We expect to see continued very strong core mortgage growth from EWS approaching this level in the second half. As a reminder, we estimate the U.S. mortgage market as the change in USIS credit inquiries. In a rising interest rate environment, we believe consumers tend to rate shop more frequently, thus creating a favorable variance between mortgage credit inquiries and originations. This trend benefits USIS credit file poles. In the second quarter, we saw mortgage credit inquiries perform on the order of four points better than the estimated change in the mortgage origination units estimated by MBA. However, TWN income and employment is typically called later in the mortgage application process and at closing. As a result, EWS does not benefit as much from the upfront rate shopping trend that occurs in a rising interest rate environment as TWN inquiries are more closely correlated to mortgage originations. Turning to slide seven. In 2022, we expect non-mortgage revenues to be 77% of total Equifax revenues, which is up a very strong 900 basis points from the 68% of total Equifax revenues that we saw in 2021. Given the above-market growth in fast-growing Workforce Solutions verticals such as talent, government and card, further penetration identity and fraud accelerated by our 2021 acquisition account and accelerated NPIs with a vitality index expected to be 11% in 2022 and of course, growth in our international markets. We also expect non-mortgage revenue will benefit from being the only cloud-native credit bureau through always-on system stability, faster transaction processing and leveraging the Data Fabric to expand our NPIs. Turning now to slide eight. Workforce Solutions delivered outstanding 41% core revenue growth in the second quarter the fifth quarter over 40% revenue growth in the last six quarters and their 10th quarter of double-digit revenue growth driven by outstanding non-mortgage growth of over 50%. As a reminder, non-mortgage revenue is over 65% of Workforce Solutions and a big EWS growth driver for the future. Rudy Ploder and the Workforce Solutions team continued outstanding execution across their key growth drivers detailed on the right-hand side of this slide. As I referenced earlier, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire LawLogix last night, the next in a string of bolt-on acquisitions that strengthen Workforce Solutions Employer Services vertical and adds TWN records. Over the past two years, we've completed six bolt-on acquisitions supporting Workforce Solutions growth, including EFRA since last fall, and LawLogix this morning. Turning to slide nine, Workforce Solutions very strong performance is driven by the team's consistent execution across their key growth levers that will drive their long-term growth of 13% to 15%, including, first, growing the work number database. Since late last year, we signed four new exclusive agreements with large payroll processors that we started to board in the second quarter and expect to have all of them contributing records by the end of the third quarter. We ended the quarter with $144 million total current records, which is up a very strong 22% from last year and up 6% sequentially. These $144 million total records represent 110 million unique individuals, representing two-thirds of the over 160 million W-2 employees, included in U.S. Non-farm payroll. In addition to traditional W-2 wage earners, we estimate there are approximately 30 million to 40 million gig workers and 20 million to 30 million pensioners in the U.S. who will also bring valuable insights to lenders, background screeners and government agencies. We're in the very early innings of collecting records on these 50 million to 70 million non-W-2 wage earners, but expect to make significant progress as we move through 2022 and 2023. We have the ability to double our TWN database with the total potential market for income and employment information on about 220 million individuals versus the $110 million we have today. As a reminder, over 50% of our records are contributed directly by individual employers. The remaining are contributed through partnerships principally with payroll companies. The vast majority of our partnerships with payroll companies are exclusive, including all the relationships we've signed in the past four-plus years. Second, Workforce is increasing penetration in their key non-mortgage verticals of mortgage, talent, government and consumer finance, with all four verticals having significant opportunity for continued expansion by new products, leveraging our expanding TWN active and historical data assets. Our talent and government businesses have seen average organic growth of over 50% since last year and over 20% CAGR since 2017. Our strength in talent and government is driven by the depth and coverage of our TWN database with over 570 million total records, both current and historic that provide both current and previous employment information on individuals allowing us to increasingly provide an instant digital resume or employment verification on both current and historical job histories. The expanding depth of our TWN database and expansion of the Workforce Solutions talent data hub as well as the increasing ease of integrations as workforce leverages the API capabilities through our new Google Cloud is also providing the ability to continue to increase penetration in key verticals. We workforce is expanding their system and system integrations. Currently, more than 75% of our mortgage transactions are system and system integrations as web access, which is up over two versus web access which is up over 2x from 2019. As you know, we get about a 20% lift in mortgage pools when we convert our customers from web to system to system integrations. In Talent Solutions, system-to-system now represents more than 85% of transactions while in government, we have more opportunity with about 65% of transactions on a system-to-system basis. As a reminder, close to 100% of credit files are delivered system-to-system for originations. From our perspective, it's only a matter of time for TWN to approach these levels of system-to-system integrations with customers, which, of course, will drive our revenue. As workforce continues to deliver greater value to customers through deepening the database and extending real-time system-to-system integrations and accelerating its launch of higher-value, vertical-specific new products average revenue per transaction will continue to grow significantly, both through higher value and price new products and annual price increases. As I said earlier, Rudy and the EWS team have a long runway for growth, leveraging multiple levers in 2022 and beyond. We have a lot of confidence in workforce's ability to deliver on their 13% to 15% long-term framework. As a reminder, over the past three years, they've delivered 34% CAGR, which, of course, is well above our 13% to 15% long-term growth framework. Turning to slide 10, workforce Solutions had another exceptional quarter, delivering $609 million of revenue, their second revenue quarter above $600 million. Revenue growth was up a very strong 21% with organic revenue growth of 11%, despite the significant decline in the U.S. mortgage market. Non-mortgage revenue is now over 65% of Workforce Solutions with organic growth of 30%. Verification Services revenue of $505 million, up 28% and was over $500 million for the second quarter in a row, again, despite the decline in the mortgage market. Non-mortgage verticals now represent almost 60% of verifier revenue and delivered 90% and 53% -- 90% total and 53% organic growth, APRs Insights which we acquired late last year, delivered strong 15% growth in the quarter. Growth was strong in their key verticals of risk and justice intelligence. Risk Intelligence helps background screeners analyze people risks via background checks and continuous monitoring. And Justice Intelligence helps channel partners assist law enforcement agencies in their investigations. Increased customer penetration, leg space expansion and strong hiring volumes are driving growth. And their NPI pipeline also remains strong. We are very positive about the future growth and potential of our Insights business. Talent and Government solution, which now represents 40% of Workforce Solutions and almost 80% of verifier non-mortgage, respectively, both had outstanding quarters. Talent Solutions delivered 134% total and 73% organic growth in the quarter on record growth and strong new product revenue. We also saw strong growth in the government vertical with revenue up 100% total and 50% organic with significant new wins at the state level and continued growth of our large SSA contract. The continued expansion of Workforce Solutions data hub and the fast-growing $5 billion talent and 2 billion government TAMs is driving strong double-digit organic revenue growth in both verticals, leveraging Workforce Solutions over $570 million current and historical records for new products. The integration of unique Appriss Insights National Student Clearinghouse and other talent-related data assets strengthens our ability to deliver to these new solutions, leveraging the EWS data hub and drive outsized growth in the future. Non-mortgage consumer lending business, principally in banking and auto also showed strong growth, up 18% in the quarter and debt management grew over 70% in the quarter. Employer Services revenue of $105 million was down 3% due to the expected decline in our unemployment claims and employee retention credit businesses. We expect total UC and ERC revenue to be down over 25% during 2022 driven by lower jobless claims and lower ERC transactions as well as the COVID federal tax credit program -- the COVID federal tax program runs out. Employer Services revenue, excluding UC and ERC, was up a strong 42% in the quarter, driven by strong base double-digit growth in our I-9 and onboarding healthy FX and our tax credit businesses. Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margin remained strong at 53.4%. In the quarter, we increased spending relative to our April expectations on both technology and marketing, principally for new products. The strength of Workforce Solutions and uniqueness and value of their in income and employment data in Employer Services businesses was clear again in the second quarter. Rudy and the EWS team delivered another outstanding quarter with 21% revenue growth and 41% core growth well above the 13% to 15% long-term framework, and we're well positioned to deliver a very strong 2022 and continued above-market growth in the future. Turning on to slide 11. USIS revenue of $421 million was down 7.5% compared to last year and slightly below our expectations. The decline was driven by the reduction in USIS mortgage revenue, which at $113 million is about 25% of total USIS revenue and was down 29% in the quarter, about 4 percentage points better than the overall mortgage market credit inquiries that declined 33%. Importantly, USIS delivered their sixth consecutive quarter of growth in B2B non-mortgage revenue of $259 million which represents over 60% of total USIS revenue and was up 6% with our organic revenue growth of 4%. This was at the low end of the 6% to 7% growth we discussed in April due to lower-than-expected FMS potential marketing services revenue. Importantly, B2B non-mortgage online revenue growth was strong at 9% with 7% organic growth. During the quarter, we saw double-digit growth in insurance, financial services, commercial as well as Kount, our identity and fraud business. We also saw growth in direct-to-consumer with auto about flat in the quarter on favorable pricing offset by lower volumes given the continued auto supply chain issues. Kount which provides unique identity and fraud solution continues to perform very well. Our core new product growth continues to be strong, and the team continues to execute on the development of joint solutions, leveraging both Kount and Equifax data including combining Kount's market-leading Omniscore AI capabilities and digital identity data with Equifax' physical identity into a single score to enhance fraud protection. Financial Marketing Services, our B2B offline business had revenue of $55 million, down 5% year-over-year and although better than the first quarter was lower than our expectations. FMS is principally comprised of three lines of business, including first fraud and data services in which we provide header data principally to providers of identity and fraud services which is the line of business is driving the weakness in our B2B off-line. Fraud and data services historically represents over 20% of our offline revenue, but has declined substantially in the first half. We saw this decline in the first quarter as customers either decreased frequency of refresh data or shifted to use of their own internal data. This decline continued in the second quarter. Revenue was about 10% of B2B offline in the first half. We expect revenue at this level to continue through 2022 as the team focuses on bringing new solutions to market later this year. Marketing Services, which represents over half of B2B offline revenue in the first half, performed very well growing but not consistent with our non-mortgage B2B online organic growth. This is a business in which we provide data in decisioning principally to financial institutions for prescreens as well as providing our IXI data for marketing activities. And third, risk management or portfolio review represents about a third of B2B offline revenue. This is a line of business in which we provide data and analytics services to financial institutions to evaluate the health of their existing portfolios or in some cases, portfolios they're acquiring. This business is often somewhat countercyclical as customers perform more risk analytics during weak economic periods. This business was down slightly in the first half and slightly weaker than expected, we expect this business to be down slightly for the remainder of the year. Overall, for our Financial Marketing Services and B2B offline for the remainder of 2022, we expect to see declines in line with the second quarter as the weakness in the Fraud and Data Services is partially offset by continued good growth in Marketing Services. As we look to 2023, the completion of the Equifax new cloud data fabric will enable enhanced product offerings in B2B offline combining U.S. credit file, DataX, Teletrack, TWN, IDN fraud and NCTUE data. We believe this will drive growth across all three of our B2B offline lines of business as we get to 2023. For B2B non-mortgage in total, we expect to see continued strong online growth consistent with the first half. However, declines in Financial Marketing Services are expected to result in second half total B2B non-mortgage growth at or slightly below the bottom end of our long-term framework of 6% to 8% revenue growth. USIS Consumer Solutions business, the U.S. D2C business from GCS that we combined with USIS in the fourth quarter last year, had revenue of $49 million, up 3% in the quarter and about flat versus last year. We expect second half growth rates to improve as the team leverages the cloud to roll out NPIs. USIS sales team had a strong quarter with a number of key wins resulting in a healthy win rate and their new deal pipeline remains very strong with the overall pipe slightly higher than the first quarter. And USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 38.2% in the quarter, 110 basis points lower than the first quarter but better than our expectations. The decline relative to the first quarter is principally driven by lower revenue from the decline in mortgage. Turning now to International, as shown on slide 12, the revenue was $286 million, up a strong 11.5% on a local currency basis. We're seeing broad-based execution from our International businesses. New York local currency revenue was up 16%, principally driven by strength in our U.K. debt management business. We've seen significant increases in debt placements from the U.K. government over the past several quarters that we expect to continue. Our European CRE businesses was about flat in the quarter and below our expectations, driven by declines in consumer direct and commercial, partially offset by strong growth in identity and fraud. Asia Pacific local currency revenue was 6%, driven by strong growth in our Australia consumer business, HR services and identity and fraud. Latin American local currency revenue was up 28%, driven by strong double-digit growth in Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Mexico and Central America. The teams\u2019 strong new product introductions over the past three years and pricing actions continue to drive strong growth across the region. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of growth for Latin America. Canada local currency revenue was up 2% below our expectations. We saw growth in Commercial and Analytics Solutions, which was partially offset by consumer services, mortgage-related products and online businesses due to interest rate increases. International adjusted EBITDA margins at 24.7% were down 200 basis points from last year due primarily to the elimination of equity income from our Russia joint venture. As shown on slide 13, we had another very strong new product quarter with our Vitality Index over 13%, which is up 400 basis points above our full year 2021 Vitality goal in 300 basis points above our 10% long-term framework goal and our highest vitality performance ever. Building on the record 151 new products last year, we delivered over 50 new products leveraging the new EFX cloud so far in 2022 with broad-based execution across all of our business units. We've detailed some of the more significant new products on this slide. Leveraging our new EFX cloud capabilities to drive new product rollouts, we expect to deliver a Vitality Index of over 11% this year, which equates to over $550 million of new product revenue in 2022. We believe our strong NPI revenue generation is an important early indicator of the benefits of the new Equifax cloud, new products leveraging our differentiated data and new EFX cloud capabilities are central to our long-term growth framework and driving future Equifax top-line growth. A detail on slide 14, reinvesting our strong cash flow and accretive and strategic bolt-on M&A is central to our EFX 2023 growth strategy and long-term framework. We expect to add 1% to 2% of revenue growth annually from strategic bolt-on M&A, including LawLogix that we announced this morning. We completed 11 acquisitions since the January 2021, aligned with our strategy to add bolt-on M&A around three strategic priorities; number one, expanding and strengthening Workforce Solutions, our fastest-growing and most profitable business; number two, adding unique data assets; and number three, building out and expanding our ID and fraud business. Slide 15 provides detail on our latest acquisition of LawLogix, which further strengthens our Workforce Solutions, employer solutions capabilities and provides I-9 management and immigration case management solutions focused on removing friction during the employee onboarding experience. LawLogix's suite of products supplements employer services capabilities by building upon investments made to help clients enable automation, deepen employee insights and increase efficiency. Our I-9 Anywhere product has seen very strong 45% growth over the past few years. The LawLogix's acquisition is aligned with our M&A priority of expanding and strengthening our strongest and fastest-growing business, Workforce Solutions. With that, I'll turn it over to John to provide some more details on the mortgage market and our third quarter and full year 2022 guidance. John Gamble : Thanks, Mark. As Mark mentioned and as shown on slide 16, our guidance now reflects an expectation that the U.S. mortgage market credit inquiries will decline over 46% in the second half of 2022, a continued decline from the down 40% level we're seeing in early July. Our assumptions reflect mortgage originations, 200 basis points to 300 basis points weaker than those levels with the work number inquiries more closely linked to mortgage originations. The reduction in U.S. mortgage credit inquiries of over 46% in the second half is off the second half 2021 reduction over 20%. This level of U.S. mortgage credit inquiries in the second half is over 30% lower than the second half average levels we saw over the 2015 to 2019 period. 1Q mortgage revenue was 29.5% of total Equifax revenues and 2Q mortgage revenue was 24.7% of total Equifax revenues. In 3Q, we expect mortgage to make up just over 21% of total Equifax revenues and about 23.5% in the full year of 2022. As we have shared in prior quarters, slide 17 provides a view of both the number of home mortgages that would have a rate benefit from refinancing on the left and a view of the levels of home purchases on the right. The left side of the slide provides a perspective on the number of home mortgages for which a refinancing would provide a rate benefit, the in-the-money population of mortgages. The in-the-money population is about 1.9 million homes and below the $3.3 million we saw in April. At the current level, mortgage refi activity is heavily driven by cash of refis that are often executed with no rate benefit or rate increase. For perspective, for the most recent available Black Knight data for May 2022, about 95% of re-financings were cash out. As shown on the right side of slide 17, the pace of existing home purchases continues at high levels, but were down about 7% in May and 14% in June from the levels we saw in 2021. We -- we believe our assumptions for U.S. mortgage market credit inquiries over the last six months of 2022 reflect the trends just discussed. The 46.5% year-to-year decline in mortgage credit increase reflects a continued sequential weakening of the mortgage market with third quarter increase down over 25% in the second quarter and fourth quarter down a further over 15% from these much reduced third quarter levels. The rapidly changing and unprecedented macro environment makes forecasting the impact on the U.S. mortgage market incredibly challenging. We will continue to be transparent with you about changes in the mortgage market and the impacts on our business. Slide 18 provides a walk detailing the drivers of the 5.2% constant currency and 3.6% total revenue growth to the midpoint of our 2022 revenue guidance of $5.1 billion. Revenue decline from the midpoint of our April guidance of $5.2 billion is driven by about two-thirds by the decline in the mortgage revenue, reflecting the expectation of a weaker U.S. Mortgage market with the remainder due to a greater negative impact from FX. The over 37% decline in the U.S. mortgage market is negatively impacting 2022 growth by about 12%, about 150 basis points more negative than the levels we discussed in April. When combined with the expected declines in the Workforce Solutions unemployment claims in the ERC businesses that we discussed with you in April, total headwinds into 2022 revenue growth are about 13 percentage points. As Mark discussed earlier, core revenue growth is expected to be 17% and organic revenue growth to be at almost 15%, consistent with our April guidance. Both well above our long-term growth framework and reflecting outstanding growth and execution on new products. Non-mortgage organic revenue growth is driving 11% of the core organic revenue growth. The largest contributor continues to be Workforce Solutions with strong organic growth in talent solutions, government and employee boarding solutions, including I-9. International and USIS non-mortgage are also expected to drive core growth. Slide 19 provides an adjusted EPS walk, detailing the drivers of the expected 0.4% growth to the midpoint of our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance of $7.68 per share. The growth in revenue and expansion in EBITDA margins by about 25 basis points drives growth and EPS of about 8%. Higher depreciation and interest expense and the negative impact of weaker FX are principally offsetting this growth in adjusted EPS. The reduction of $0.47 or about $75 million in pre-tax income from the midpoint of the guidance we provided in April is at a high level driven by the following : higher interest expense of about $13 million and weakening FX impacting income by over $8 million negatively impacted pre-tax income by over $21 million. The remaining about $54 million in lower pre-tax income is driven by the reduction in mortgage revenue with high variable margins. Some other factors impacting overall 2022 EBITDA margins in our July guidance relative to April guidance include an increased spending on product technology and related marketing to continue to drive NPI. International stronger-than-expected revenue growth includes strong growth in debt management, which has somewhat lower margins and, therefore, puts margin pressure on international and lower overall variable compensation benefits margins. As I just referenced, we are continuing our investments in new product development and related marketing and sales and our data and technology cloud transformation as these are the levers driving our over 10% new product Vitality index and improved cost structure in 2023 and beyond. We will continue to tightly manage spend outside these critical growth areas. Slide 20 provides the specifics on our 2022 full-year guidance, which I also just discussed. At a BU level, our updated view of U.S. mortgage impacted both EWS and USIS. EWS is expected to deliver revenue growth of around 15% as strong non-mortgage growth expected to be over 40% is partially offset by the impact of the weaker mortgage market. EWS EBITDA margins are expected to approach 53%, slightly lower than 2021. USIS revenue is expected to be down 8.5%, reflecting the greater than 37% assumed decline in the U.S. mortgage market. B2B non-mortgage revenue is expected to be slightly below or at the low end of our long-term framework for USIS of 6% to 8%, reflecting the decline in B2B offline discussed earlier. USIS EBITDA margins are expected to be about 37%, reflecting the impact of the weaker mortgage market. International continues to deliver a strong year and is expected to deliver constant currency revenue growth of about 10%. International EBITDA margins are expected to be about 27%. International EBITDA margins are negatively impacted by product mix as our debt management business, which is growing strongly in 2022 as somewhat lower margins than our credit business. For the full year of 2022, we expect capital expenditures to be in excess of $500 million. Slide 21 provides our guidance for 3Q 2022 and we expect revenue in the range of $1.21 billion to $1.23 billion, reflecting revenue of about flat year-to-year at the midpoint of our guidance, we're up just under 2% on a constant currency basis. Similar to full year 2022, in the third quarter, we are overcoming significant revenue growth headwinds of about 17% from both the decline in the U.S. mortgage market, which is impacting revenue growth by 15% and the normalization of the unemployment claims in the ERC businesses. Core organic revenue growth on a constant currency basis of 15% and above 4% revenue benefit from acquisitions are allowing us to overcome these headwinds and deliver constant currency growth in the quarter. 3Q 2022 EBITDA margins are expected to be flat to slightly down year-to-year. The flat EBITDA margins reflect the flat year-to-year revenue as well as execution of the planned cost reductions related to transformation, the benefit of which is being principally offset by year-to-year cost increases and the dilutive effect on near-term margins of the 2021 and 2022 acquisitions. This impact on margins will be eliminated with time as acquisition synergies drive these margins higher. We're expecting adjusted EPS in 3Q 2022 of $1.60 to $1.70 per share compared to 3Q 2021 adjusted EPS of $1.85 per share. The decline in adjusted EPS in 3Q 2022 year-to-year is driven by an over 15% per share negative impact on adjusted EPS of items below operating income, specifically interest expense, lost other income, principally from our Russia JV and a lower tax rate in 3Q 2021 related to specific discrete items. Adjusting for these items and the negative impact of FX as well as the increased depreciation we are incurring related to tech transformation, adjusted EPS at the midpoint of our guidance would be about flat to 3Q 2021 and consistent with flat revenue. We believe both our third quarter and full year 2022 guidance are centered at the midpoint of the revenue and adjusted EPS ranges we provided. Now, I'd like to turn it back over to Mark. Mark Begor : Thanks John. Turning to slide 20 -- 22, the new Equifax is a much different business today than we were in the last recession. We're more resilient and better positioned for stronger revenue and earnings growth. During the 2008 to 2009 global financial crisis, Equifax performed very well and exhibited the resiliency we expect from the data analytics business. In 2009, we saw only a 6% decline in total revenue. Importantly, Workforce Solutions revenue grew throughout the period and showed substantial growth of 17% in 2009 from TWN record additions and their other growth levers, which drove higher verification rates and strong unemployment revenue growth from the growing unemployment levels in 2009. We believe that Equifax business mix is much better positioned for a potential economic event in the future than we were in 2009. Strong Workforce Solutions growth has increased their relative size in Equifax from 16% of revenue in 2009 to almost 50% today with margins above 50%, about 20 percentage points higher than the Equifax average. EWS is benefiting from strong growth levers that are not directly tied to economic activity, including record growth, penetration into new fast-growing verticals like talent and government, system-to-system integrations, deploying new and higher-value products as well as the measured price actions, taking advantage of the scale of the TWN database. Second, completion of the Equifax Cloud will deliver cost savings in 2023 and beyond, we expect we'll drive about half of our targeted 500 basis point margin expansion from 2022 to 2025. The cloud migration cost savings are independent of any economic event and driven by our execution. And third, we're leveraging the cloud to accelerate new product development with a goal of 11% vitality index in 2022, which is over $500 million of annual incremental revenue -- new product revenue for Equifax. As a reminder, new products rolled out in 2021 and 2022 will drive top line growth in 2023 and beyond as they mature in the marketplace. To estimate the impact of a recession that we have on Equifax, we've assigned our lines of businesses into three categories : first, recession growth or recession resistant. These businesses have drivers that are not directly aligned with economic activity and recession, and we expect them to grow during a recession. The best examples of this are Workforce Solutions, U.S. mortgage identity and fraud and our government lines of businesses that we expect will continue to grow during an economic event from the uniqueness of the data, including TWN or from low interest rate environments that impact our mortgage business. Second is our countercyclical businesses that typically perform better during recession and the best example is our unemployment claims management business where we expect significant growth in Workforce Solutions from growing unemployment in the U.S. or some of our account management solutions. And third, recession impacted. These are businesses that are directly impacted by economic activity and contract in a recession, and they include auto, cards, P loans where both consumer activity declines or lender activity is contracted for risk containment reasons. We expect these business lines to be flat to negative revenue growth in recession. Today, we believe almost 60% of our global business is recession-resilient or countercyclical. This is a big change in a strong position compared to Equifax in the 2008 global financial crisis, where only about 40% of our businesses were either recession-resistant or countercyclical. The meaningful revenue growth in Workforce Solutions, U.S. mortgage identity and fraud since 2009, as well as the cloud transformation cost savings, position Equifax very well if there is an economic event recession in 2023 or beyond. As highlighted on slide 23, we remain laser-focused on executing our EFX2023 growth strategy to leverage the new EFX cloud for innovation and new products. EFX2023 is the foundation of our new 8% to 12% long-term growth framework. We continue to make significant progress executing the EFX cloud data and technology transformation. We're now approaching 60% of total revenue being delivered from the new AFX Cloud. And we've completed over 139,000 B2B migrations and over 10 million consumer migrations. Our international transformation is also progressing, and we continue to expect to principally complete the transition by geographic region as we move through 2023 and into 2024. We're in the early days of leveraging our new EFX cloud capabilities and are confident that it will differentiate us commercially expanding our NPI capabilities, accelerating our topline growth and expand our margins from the growth in cost savings in 2022 and beyond. We remain confident in our plan to become the only cloud-native data analytics company. Wrapping up on slide 24, Equifax delivered another strong and broad-based quarter with 7% overall growth and 19% core growth and a 13% vitality index, more than offsetting a 33% decline in the mortgage market. Against the declining mortgage market, Equifax is resilient, on offense and investing for future growth. Our updated 2022 revenue and adjusted EPS guidance reflects the impact of the expected accelerated decline in the U.S. mortgage market to a decline of over 46% in the second half of 2022, resulting in a mortgage market decline of over 30% for the year -- 37% for the year. Against this unprecedented mortgage market decline, Equifax will deliver constant currency revenue over 5% and deliver growth in adjusted EPS. More importantly, our core revenue growth of 17% and non-mortgage growth of 16% are both well above our 8% to 12% long-term framework and reflect the strength of the underlying Equifax business model today and in the future. EWS continues to deliver above market growth and it was our largest, fastest-growing and highest-margin business. Workforce Solutions above market, 34% revenue CAGR over the last three years is powering Equifax growth as they approach 50% of our revenue. New products leveraging the new Equifax cloud are also driving growth. Our 11% vitality from NPIs in 2022 will drive growth in 2023 and beyond. And we are in the early days of leveraging the new Equifax cloud to drive innovation in new products. Our 11 bolt-on acquisitions since January 2021 have expanded our capabilities and are delivering strong topline growth and will deliver synergies in 2023 and beyond. And then last, we're in the final chapters of completing our four-year $1.5 billion transformation to the cloud that will deliver topline growth and cost benefits in 2023 and beyond. Even in these uncertain economic environment, Equifax continues to be on offense and reinvesting in the new Equifax cloud, new products, data analytics and bolt-on M&A to drive future growth. We continue to be confident in our long-term framework of 8% to 12% revenue growth, our goal of $7 billion of revenue in 2020 -- or by 2025. Our ability to expand our margins 500 basis points between 2022 and 2025 and 50 basis points per year of margin expansion longer term. We remain energized about our performance in 2022 in a challenging mortgage market macro and even more energized about the future of the new Equifax, a faster-growing, higher-margin cloud-native data Analytics Company. And with that, operator, let me open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question today is coming from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is now live. Manav Patnaik : Thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to touch on the strength of non-mortgage Workforce Solutions businesses and kind of the sustainability of that business? And maybe if you could just comment specifically on the Talent Solutions side, just given all the announcements you're starting to see on hiring freezes or layoffs, et cetera. Do you anticipate any slowdown there? Mark Begor : Yes. So it's a great question, Manav. As you know, we're investing heavily in the non -- one of our priorities is to invest heavily in workforce broadly because it's our fastest growing business. And -- as you pointed out, the non-mortgage businesses and workforce are really outperforming the underlying market and delivering substantial growth. And I'll touch on talent first, as you pointed out, a big TAM of $5 billion and our play there is to help digitize the background screeners using our data as we continue to expand our historical data, we can deliver real solutions there. And we haven't seen any impact from the hiring market. As you know, unemployment is still very low. There's still more jobs open. And there are people looking for them. And even in -- if that starts to slow down in the future, there's just so much penetration opportunity for us to really work to help digitize the background screening environment, both with our core work history. As you know, we have $570 million total record. So we have a digital resume on the average American worker that totals five jobs for each individual. So there's just a lot of data and growth opportunity there. And then we're also, as you know, adding data assets to go beyond just that work history and talent, whether it's education, medical credentialing data that we acquired with APRs Insights, of course, the incarceration data that's used in virtually every background screen. And we have a stated strategy to look for more partnerships or M&A to really strengthen the Talent hub. So I don't expect them to grow at the rate they have been over the last couple of years, which is very, very strong. But certainly, there will be a big growth driver going forward with double-digit growth in the future. Government, as you know, is another big non-mortgage vertical for Workforce Solutions. That's around social services, the $2 billion -- or a few trillion dollar government TAM is a big one. We have a lot of penetration opportunities there. Social services are only expanding. And it's really the same thing. We're able to deliver an instant decision to that government agency, either the federal, state or local level. And we're just seeing a lot of traction. They have the same labor issues, meaning they're looking for productivity in the centers where people come in to apply for social services. And we can deliver productivity with the instant decisioning. And of course, it also delivers that social service to that individual very quickly. And same thing the ability now to not only have that income and employment information that's used in really every social service is needs or income-based. But also adding to the incarceration data that we have. It's used in virtually all social service processes. Beyond talent and government, just touching quickly on kind of non-mortgage financial services, those are newer verticals for workforce with the data, whether it's in the card space where we're starting to get penetration to have the income and employment data, supplement the credit data in a card origination. Of course, auto, we've seen nice growth in sub-prime and moving into near prime and of course, it's used in P loans. And then just jumping outside of verifications and new employer services, as you know, we've been making acquisitions. We've done five acquisitions in the employer services space in the last two years to really build out the capabilities in those regulatory compliance services, whether it's unemployment claims, work opportunity tax credit, ACA or health care. And of course, in the work opportunity tax credit and I-9 benefits like LawLogix that we announced this morning, that's a space that has a big $5 billion, $6 billion TAM in a more challenging economic environment. We expect more outsourcing by HR managers of those activities that we can perform more efficiently. So we see growth opportunities for that business, which is why we're investing in technology and the bolt-on M&A like a LawLogix. And of course, as you know, as we expand our capabilities and reach there with individual companies, we get more records. And of course, underlying the growth of workforce and, of course, non-mortgage is record growth, which was up a strong 22% in the quarter, and we still have a long runway to essentially double the size of our database when you include gig and pension income recipients. So there's a lot of opportunity there. So, lots of levers for non-mortgage in Workforce Solutions. Manav Patnaik : Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. And then maybe just to follow-up, like in terms of the M&A pipeline, a lot of these tuck-ins, I guess, it makes sense, but just given -- and maybe just some comments around what valuations in the private market look like and your advertising capacity from maybe larger deals than these tuck-insurance? Mark Begor : Yes. I think as you know, we've tried to be very disciplined about our approach to M&A. We're very -- I use the term bolt-on. You can describe how big bolt-on is. Obviously, Appriss was a larger acquisition, Kount was a larger acquisition last year. But we see a lot of opportunity to deliver very high return bolt-on M&A that are highly accretive to our cost of capital. So it's you start with our kind of capital allocation, we see big opportunities to invest in the core of Equifax and we're doing that. And that's really through our cloud transformation, which we're in the final innings of completing. That was a big project and a big focus of Equifax. That will start tailing off our investment in that over the coming year or so as we complete the cloud. New products, we get very high return on. And then when you get into inorganic, we see an opportunity to continue to do bolt-on M&A that adds very positively, and we are very disciplined financially and looking for businesses that are growing faster than Equifax on the top line that are accretive to our margins and obviously deliver high returns. So those are the kind of M&A that we're doing and we've got a pipeline going forward of deals that we continue to look at that will really add value in the three areas that I talked about during my prepared comments of strengthening workforce, adding differentiated data and strengthening identity and fraud. And as you know, as we go into 2023, 2024, 2025, with our margin expansion accelerating in that 500 basis points to 39% in 2025, our free cash flow accelerates dramatically in the coming 12, 24, 36 months. And we'll continue to run the play of bolt-on M&A where it's appropriate, we'll look for acquisitions that might be at the larger end of bolt-on like an Appriss. But we'll be at a point in the near future where we're going to want to return cash to shareholders. And we've been very clear that when that time comes, that will be a part of our capital allocation strategy as our free cash flow accelerates as we get into 2023, 2024, 2025 Operator : Our next question is coming from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Andrew Steinerman : Hi, John, it's Andrew. I wanted to check if that 24.7% mortgage revenue figure you gave on the call was for total revenues in the second quarter. And then also, my second question is, again, on a total company basis, what was Equifax's second quarter organic constant currency, non-mortgage revenue growth year-over-year? John Gamble : So, 24.7% was on total Equifax revenue. And then I don't believe we gave an organic revenue growth for the entire company non-mortgage. So-- Andrew Steinerman : Right. But you gave all the segments, can't you total it out for us? John Gamble : We can certainly follow up with you, Andrew. Trevor or Sam come back to you on that. Andrew Steinerman : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thanks. Next question is coming from Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live. Mark Begor : Hey, Kevin. Kevin McVeigh : Hi, Mark. Hi, John. You know towards kind of project, but any sense of kind of the near-term outlook for mortgage 2022 to 2023. And the reason I ask is obviously, it seems like unprecedented declines, but we're in a much stronger macro environment than we were back in the GFC. Is there any way to frame, do you think you see continued refi kind of cash outs more near-term on the purchase side, just as you think about mortgage within kind of the context of formal recovery given kind of where we are from kind of -- it feels like we're bottoming here. Mark Begor : Yes, I think bottoming is probably in the second half based on our forecast, Kevin, as you know. But it's very hard to really predict what's going to happen with the economy given the inflation rates that we haven't seen and really our lifetimes and what the Fed is going to do to respond to it. Yes, I would make a couple of comments on mortgage, which you know. Look, the mortgage market doesn't disappear, right? There's a core mortgage market that in any economic environment stays there, meaning people move and buy houses. People upgrade and buy houses on the purchase market. And as you know, there's more people still looking for houses in the United States today than there are houses. So there's still quite a bit of demand on the purchase side. So we expect there to be -- is there is any economic environment, a continued purchase market, and John gave some views about how we think about that in the second half. As you point out on the refi side, the interest rate refis are going to be lower or less of those in the second half given where interest rates are because there aren't many opportunities for homeowners to do an interest rate refi but there's a ton of untapped equity in homes in the United States. Over the past 24-plus months, home price appreciation is up almost 30%. And there's about $27 trillion of untapped home equity. And we've seen in economic environments in the past, that homeowners will tap into that equity. If you think about a 5.5% fixed rate mortgage in order to refi into that to access your home equity, which consumers are doing or homeowners are doing. We expect that to continue. And if you think about 5.5% interest rate on fixed rate mortgage, that's a heck of a lot less than an auto loan, a student loan or a credit card. And that's what you'll see consumers do. So it'll be a level cash-out refis going forward. And I know you get that. I think the challenging part is what's going to happen, how far is the Fed going to have to go to slow down inflation with it at 9.1%. So that's a harder part for us to forecast. We did talk about in our prepared comments that we remain confident in, obviously, the long-term future of Equifax. Our goal of $7 billion by 2025 hasn't changed our goal to expand our margins to 39% by 2025 hasn't changed. And we're still investing in the future of Equifax. As we speak, we're making investments that will benefit 2023, 2024, 2025 based on our strong performance, particularly in non-mortgage, which is exceptionally strong. Kevin McVeigh : And actually, that's what I want to follow-up, because it seems like you're still comfortable with those 2025 targets. It's probably mortgage a little bit lighter. Where's been kind of the offset? Is it within EWS or other parts of the business that continue to give you the confidence to push towards those 2025 targets? Mark Begor : Yes, it's certainly, I think, as you know, we raised our non-mortgage or core guidance twice this year, one in February and once in April, that gives us confidence. It should give you confidence. And if you look at our non-mortgage performance and our core growth performance, which includes how we're performing beyond the mortgage market, those are strong numbers. And those give us confidence in our ability. And then if you add to it, during that 2023 to 2024 time frame. In the next 12 months, we're going to be completing substantially the U.S. cloud migration, so we'll be cloud native, and we can take full advantage of that. We'll finish international as we get through 2023 and into 2024. That's another lift for Workforce Solutions. The other thing that should give you confidence and gives us confidence is the M&A that we've done over the last 18 months. We've done 11 acquisitions now with LawLogix. Those are in our run rate revenue or will be. And, of course, the synergies from those acquisitions that we had in our acquisition cases really kick in, in 2023, 2024, 2025, as they really get integrated into our businesses. And then the last point I'd make that gives us confidence is NPIs. The Vitality index that we're delivering, as you know, our long-term frame on Vitality is10, we were 13% in the quarter, we're expecting to be north of 11% for the year. Those are big numbers when you talk about having $550 million of revenue in 2022 from new products. And remember, new products we introduced in 2022 really benefit 2023, 2024, 2025. They mature as we get into those years. So there's a lot of levers that give us confidence around the future of Equifax. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Toni Kaplan : Thanks so much. First, I wanted to ask about the mortgage performance. So last quarter, you talked about EWS outperforming the mortgage market by about 30 points in the year. And for the quarter, last quarter it was about $27 million points above the market. This quarter looks a little bit more like you outperformed by 20 points according to slide 10. So, are you still expecting the 30? Or has something changed to bring that down a little bit? And what are sort of the drivers that lead to that outperformance delta, like why would it jump around, I guess? John Gamble : Sure. And so I think last quarter, what we indicated, we were up 27% and we thought for the full year, we could deliver something south of 30%. But I think the 20 points is very strong, right? And what drives the outperformance in general is the new products, the price actions, the record additions, and all of those activities at Workforce Solutions is executing extremely well, actually executing faster than planned. The record additions, as Mark already covered, were well faster than planned as we're up to 144 million records. They're all volume dependent, right? So, when we get into hit into circumstances where we see the current year volumes decline substantially. It makes it more difficult to outperform the prior year market because of the lower volumes. So that's all it really is in terms of the drivers that will allow them to outperform the market over the long-term, they're actually outperforming the expectations we had when we started the year. So, we feel very good about how they're performing. We think given the much lower level of mortgage inquiries we're talking about, of mortgage originations we're talking about in the second half, if they're able to outperform at about 20 or I think we just said somewhat under 20% that, that will be very, very strong and consistent with the execution against product price records, system integrations that we've been talking about. Toni Kaplan : Great. In the guidance, it seems like the main delta on the revenue side is really mortgage, you're expecting essentially the non-mortgage expectations outside of FX, largely on change versus your guidance last quarter. Just if we look forward, if there is a recession or a tougher environment that comes up, just maybe talk about some of the expense levers that you can pull and how you think about when to pull the trigger on that versus continued investment in the business, because obviously, you have a lot of really strong growth opportunities that you want to capitalize on. So, maybe just how are you thinking about downturn playbook and when you would pull the trigger? Mark Begor : Yes, it's a great question, Tony. This is Mark. First off, we don't see that in the second half. You may have a different point of view, but we don't see that in the second half. But to be clear, we think about it a lot, obviously, and we do have levers. First off, we think we're going to outperform the way we did in the past, if there was an economic event. We had a page in how we talked about it in the investor deck, and we talked with you about it before. The difference in the business and levers like continuing to add records at Workforce Solutions and so many other levers in workforce, in particular, identity and fraud business. So, we think about that. But we clearly have the ability to throttle cost if we got into an economic event. In 2022, while we're seeing the pressure from the mortgage market macro and it's also FX revenue, we made the decision to continue to invest, which is I think you want us to do and our investors do, because our core business or non-mortgage business, which is a big part of Equifax is performing exceptionally well, and we want to keep driving that. So, investing in things like new products, investing in completing the cloud transformation, which, of course, that will take a lot of our cost out as we get into 2022 -- I'm sorry, 2023, 2024, 2025, we get significant margin expansion or cost reductions as we complete the cloud and decommission a lot of our data centers. That's kind of a natural recession hedge for us as we execute the cloud transformation. But we've got other cost levers that we could or would pull, and we'll be ready to do that if there is an economic event. But at the same time, we have a lot of confidence in how we would perform in an economic event, you know, because of the changing -- dramatically changing nature of Equifax. Would you add anything John? John Gamble : No, I just think outside of the investments Mark already talked about in NPI and transformation is kind of the product, technology and then marketing -- product marketing investments we're making. We certainly are looking at all the other expenses, and we're just going to manage those very tightly, right? So even though we don't expect a recession to come at this point in time, so not in the second half of this year, obviously, uncertain about 2023. What we are going to do is make sure we manage very tightly all of the expenses that don't drive that revenue growth. Operator : Thanks. Next question is coming from Ashish Sabadra from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks for taking my question. So Mark, thanks for providing the details around the financial marketing services business. I was just wanted to drill down further on the fraud and identity piece, and see you talked about new product innovations there, which could reaccelerate growth maybe next year. So I was just wondering if you could provide some more color on that front or maybe also talk about the pipeline for new deals, particularly on the offline side? And how should we think about those momentum going into the back half but also in 2023 and beyond? Thanks. Mark Begor : Yes. So we've talked about -- we're obviously doing some work to get some new products positioned in the second half of this year to bring the FMS portfolio review business back into a different position. That's clearly a place that we're investing in. I think part of your question was also around broader identity and fraud, which is a different business for us. That's really under the account business, which we're very pleased with. That's a business that performed exceptionally well in the quarter and the half. We see big potential in just a massive TAM around the broader identity in fraud. And of course, as you know, we bought count 18 months ago, and we're still integrating that inside of Equifax and rolling out new solutions. And that's an area that we're investing in new products for both the e-commerce space, but also for our traditional financial customers, and also looking for inorganic or M&A to continue to expand. That's one of our three priorities around M&A is to grow in identity and fraud. And in B2B offline specifically kind of the fraud header business I think some of the real opportunities we have as we get into 2023 is heavily around data fabric, right? As we're able to more aggressively integrate different data assets. Again, it will differentiate our information or header information that we sell into those markets, and we think we have the opportunity to reaccelerate that growth again. But that will happen as Data Fabric completes for USIS. Ashish Sabadra : That's very helpful color. And then going back to slide nine and drilling down further on the questions that were asked on the talent and government side. The penetration there is pretty low on talent, just 10% on the government, it's 20%. You talked about some new state wins there, but just can you talk about again, the pipeline, both on the talent and government side? And how do you drive better penetration in both of those markets? Thanks. Mark Begor : Yes. As you know, these are -- I still call the newer verticals for us in Workforce Solutions, both talent and government. They're big TAMs. Talent is a $5 billion data TAM for us. Government is about $2 billion. We've got big teams in Workforce Solutions focused on that. As we've made -- as you know, some M&A additions to strengthen our capabilities there. We want to do more. That's an area where we want to expand either M&A or partnerships, M&A being like Appriss Insights. Where we got the incarceration and medical credentialing data that's really helping us in both government and talent. The partnership we have with Nestor doing Clearinghouse, where we're bringing education data and we'd like you to do more partnerships or more M&A there. The other really lever for us in talent and government is new products is really bringing new solutions together, combining data elements we have in Workforce. And of course, at the heart of our growth in both of those verticals is our twin data set. Both our 144 million active records or 110 million active individuals in our data set, which is a huge coverage now. And as you know, when we add records, our hit rates go up because remember, in our system-to-system integrations whether it's talent or government or other verticals, they're hitting our database for every applicant or individual that they're trying to process, whether it's a mortgage or a background screen or a social service like rent support or unemployment claims, as we grow our records, that grows the business. And then leveraging our historical data, we just got so much historical data of the 570 million total records which equates to about five and a half jobs for the average American. That's a very valuable instant decisioning data set for the talent space. So, a combination of new products, continuing to grow out our twin record database and continuing to do M&A and having our dedicated teams of growing customers. There's still a lot of customers that don't use our data in government social services and in talent, so that's another opportunity. So, we're pretty energized about the growth potentials in those two verticals. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Kyle Peterson from Needham & Company. Your line is now live. Kyle Peterson : Great. Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just wanted to touch on inflation. Obviously, it's the highest we've seen in quite some time. Where are you guys kind of seeing it in the cost side of your business? And how much have you guys been able to successfully pass along to clients? John Gamble : Yes. So, I share your concern, when I think about the 9.1% inflation or 9.4% in the U.K. or pick your market, when I spend more of my time thinking about is what's the impact going to be on the consumer, on our customers. With regards to our cost structure, it hasn't had much of an impact. We haven't seen a big impact in labor. We're still able to attract the people we want inside of -- with some slight pressure on wage rates, but we're still managing that. A big part of our cost structure, as you know, is technology and we're really heading more towards cost savings there as we convert from our legacy infrastructure to the cloud, and we've got long-term contracts in our cloud infrastructure. And with regards to passing it on, price versus inflation were to net positive. We put pricing increases in place earlier this year that give us a net positive margin impact versus inflation is that even with inflation where it is today. Kyle Peterson : Understood, that's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up, particularly in the unemployment verification, claims part of the EWS business. How should we think about the puts and takes, I know you guys said you weren't currently expecting a recession, but if we do had a new recession, how much of a potential tailwind could that be in a more garden-variety recession, not with unemployment kind of where it was in 2020, but just a little more run of the mill would be helpful. Mark Begor : Yes. It's obviously a positive for us. That business is a lot bigger today than it was in 2008, 2009, obviously, we've got a lot more scale. We're expanding the business with a lot of the investments in people and technology and capabilities as well as the M&A that we've done. So, it will clearly be a tailwind. Obviously, it's a headwind right now coming off 2020 and 2021 when there was a lot of furloughs and layoffs during the COVID environment. I know, John, would you size it in any way. John Gamble : Yes. Just to give you a perspective, this year, it's a $135 million business, right? So -- and I think during the COVID recession, it increased obviously dramatically. But -- and it basically scales directly with unemployment insurance activity. So it's about $135 million. So, whatever -- however -- as you look at the level of unemployment that could come in a recession, it will scale pretty directly with that. Mark Begor : And that's just one of -- as you know, that's one of many kind of countercyclical businesses. Another -- if you're focused on countercyclical, the other one is inside of our credit business, while prescreens will go down, account management and portfolio management activity goes up in an economic event. Now, we're not seeing that today, because it's -- there isn\u2019t really an economic event yet, but that's a countercyclical element for our core credit businesses. And, of course, we got all kinds of levers in Workforce Solutions. We're going to keep adding records whether the economy is up down or sideways. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Andrew Jeffrey from Truist Securities. Your line is now live. Andrew Jeffrey : Hi. Good morning, guys. Appreciate taking the time. Mark, I wanted to ask you a question about the twin database and sort of line of sight to getting to 2x current records. Do you think you can get there with your current payroll agreements? Do you need to add more? And I know you mentioned they're exclusive today. Can you talk about your comfort with those remaining exclusive sort of in the long run? And just any color in terms of trajectory there would be helpful. Mark Begor : Yes. So, bunch of layers of questions in there. First, I think as you point out, it's a really attractive lever for growth and unique through this business, right? No other beta business that I know of has the ability to add records the way Workforce has been able to do. And, of course, it translates into revenue day one, quarter one, week one, the minute we add them, because remember, we're -- as we're integrated or even through web access, customers are coming to our data set, looking for all of their applicants. And as we grow our hit rates, it really drives the revenue. And revenue -- the records were up 22% in the quarter. We've had very strong double-digit growth for the last three years of growing the data set. And now have 144 million actives and 110 million uniques, which is really powerful in the scale of the data set. Not only is it driving revenue, but it also drives usage, meaning it's a data set that's more valuable. And remember, you think about it, our customers want 100% coverage, because the consumers that they can't identify in our data set, they got to go somewhere else to do a manual verification or do something else that slows down their process. So as we add records to our data set, we become more valuable to them. So, as you know, 50% of our records come from partnerships, 50% come from direct relationships that we have through our employer services business, and we want to grow both. On Employer Services, as you know, we've been making acquisitions. We've done five acquisitions in the last two years to strengthen our capabilities in Employer Services, whether it's in I-9, unemployment claims, work opportunity tax credit. And that's a kind of a $6 billion TAM, and we've got a $400 million-plus business. And the power of that is, not only we're growing our -- the outsourcing there. But when we get the contracts for I-9 or unemployment claims or work opportunity tax credits, we also got records. So growing record there is a big lever. The other 50% come from partnerships, so payroll processors. And what I'm referring to is really mostly W-2 or non-farm payroll income, which is the 160 million individuals in the United States versus the 110 million we have today. The newer markets for us are gig, which is $30 million to $40 million and pensioners, which is another $20 million to $30 million. So, if you think about the $110 million, there's about 220 million Americans that have some form of income. That's what we want to grow the database to, and that's going to take time. If you think about going from $110 million to $220 million, that may take a decade, but there's such a runway for growth. And we now have dedicated teams on the pension side. And we expect the onboarding records, obviously, from -- those aren't typically with payroll processors, there are other entities that are processing those, whether it's a benefits administrator or individual companies. And then the gig records, those are all records we want to add as we go forward.  I think your last question was around our partnership. The last part of your question was around your -- question was around our partnerships and exclusivity. As I said, the vast majority of our partnerships are exclusive. All the relationships we signed in the last four-plus years have been exclusive and all the relationships we intend to sign going forward as well as extend it's our intention for them to be exclusive. We think that's good for us and good for our partners going forward. Andrew Jeffrey : Super comprehensive answer. Thanks. Appreciate it. Operator : Thanks. Next question is coming from Andrew Nicholas from William Blair. Your line is now live. Andrew Nicholas : Thank you. Good morning. I think different answers have touched on this already, but I want to ask a little bit more directly about kind of the health of the U.S. consumer and what you're hearing from customers on the core credit side? Are you seeing any signs of weakness across the USIS business as it relates to core credit? Guidance doesn't seem to imply any slowdown there. So, if you could just kind of talk about what gives you confidence in that part of the outlook and the overall state of the economy? Thanks. Mark Begor : Yes. And to be clear, we're not. The U.S. consumer from our perspective is strong. I think you've heard it from the banks over the last week or so, as they talk about their performance. There's no sign. It really goes -- it starts with employment. People are working and there's two open jobs for every person looking for a job, which we've never seen in -- really our environment. You've seen strong wage growth, which is a positive, but it starts with people are working, that's a big deal. There's still a lot of stimulus around, meaning consumers are still spending some of the stimulus they saved over the COVID environment, but there's still access to a lot of stimulus or social services support in the United States, which is benefiting consumers. So, that's a positive. Obviously, inflation is having an impact on confidence having an impact on some spending and having an impact in some of the lower subprime or lower income consumers is having a bigger impact there. But kind of broadly, we don't see the consumer weakening in the second half. We haven't seen our customers thinking about it that way. There obviously -- everyone is watching, but you haven't really seen a change in delinquencies, like card delinquencies are lower than they were in 2019. There's a little uptick in subprime, auto delinquencies, but the consumer is strong and it starts with their working and then add to it, those that are homeowners have a bunch of equity in their home, plus 20%, 25%, 30% versus a couple of years ago, it's untapped. So, those are all equations that are quite positive around the consumer, which is going to make in my view, taming inflation quite challenging because consumers are still out there spending. You've seen the banks kind of credit card spends are up strong double-digits. Consumers are traveling. They're still spending, maybe not a big ticket transactions, but they're still pretty strong and we haven't seen any signs of a changing. John Gamble : Other thing which has happened since 2019 is that the percentage of consumers that are actually defined as subprime is just down materially, right? So it's down on the order of 20% of consumers and was much higher back in 2019, and that's just the strengthening of credit scores you've seen. So that's very material for people's access to credit. Mark Begor : Well, credit scores were up 15 to 20 points since 2019 still. So a lot of factors supporting the consumer. Andrew Nicholas : Great. Thank you. That's very helpful. And then switching gears a bit for my follow-up. Mark, I think you alluded to growing the work number internationally as part of the three-year 2025 outlook. I understand in the past, you've talked about your right to win there and your relationships with the global organization as being a differentiator. But just kind of curious, do you speak to kind of go-to-market strategy there? Is there any difference in these international markets than what you've developed here through payroll providers and outsourced kind of HR capabilities? Or are there differences in those markets that we should kind of keep in mind that make that go-to-market strategy a bit different abroad? Mark Begor : No, it's very similar. And we could spend hours talking about all the things we're working on. And obviously, expanding workforce internationally is one of the initiatives that Rudy and his team has. As you know, we're in four markets now. We added U.K. in the first quarter. We paused during our cloud transformation to go in other markets we're in Australia, Canada U.K. and India. We paused a couple of years ago when we were doing the cloud transformation, but now that we have a tech stack that we've invested a couple of hundred million dollars in, it makes it easy to enter new markets from a technical standpoint. So that's an approach that we have and why we kind of made our first move into the U.K. following our cloud transformation at Workforce Solutions. The market dynamics are very similar. Mortgage is a place where you want to use it, and you think about the markets we're in, they have mortgage markets, consumer mortgage markets. So, that would be a priority for us when we think about future markets -- and then the talent side is another one, using the data for the hiring process is similar. And as you point out, we have some levers with our current multinationals in the U.S. where we're collecting their records from them directly or through partnerships. But the direct relationships, they want us to do income and employment verification for them in other markets. So that's a positive. And then as you also point out, the payroll processors we do business with today in the U.S., many of them are global, so they want to do this have the same relationship outside the United States. And then in individual markets, there's payroll processors or HR software companies that are unique to so many markets, and we're developing partnerships with them. So it's clearly a part of our strategy. We've got a lot of needle movers in Workforce Solutions between now and 2025. This will be one of the smaller ones, but it's one that we're investing in. I think you'll see more traction out of it, perhaps in 2024, 2025, 2026 than you will see in 2023, 2024, but as you would expect us to do, we're investing in it. And we think we've got a franchise that obviously is -- has a strong market position here in the states, and it's one that we want to take global and take advantage of it because there really aren't other players like workforce outside the United States. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Your line is now live. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Can you dig in a little bit more on what's going on with FMS and the offline? And you said it's like the part where you're doing with fraud and header data, I'm just not clear as to what all of a sudden changed in that business? Is there something competitively that changed in where maybe one of the other bureaus are doing better over there? Or is there anything else happening? And typically, in a certain point in the cycle, you guys would see a pickup in some of the FMS business as well in terms of portfolio reviews. And I want to know, are they starting to pick up because banks are worried about that, but you're not getting them or they're just not happening? Mark Begor : Yes. The portfolio reviews are a constant part of the business. But as you point out, in times of economic challenges, that typically, we see some real pick up there. That hasn't happened yet. The financial institutions really don't view the second half of being economically challenged. It's more in the newspaper than it is in the consumer or their results. I don't know if you want to touch on the header business again? John Gamble : Yes. I think Mark covered, Shlomo, really what what's going on with the fraud or header business within FMS, right? We're just -- we are seeing lower volumes, and we're seeing lower levels of activity. And for transactions that are occurring, we're looking for seeing smaller volume transactions. So -- what we're doing is what we talked about, which is working to try to enrich our data sets so that we can, again, make it more valuable to drive greater differentiation in that market. But we're just seeing -- we're seeing that market slow currently. And given that it has, we've just made the assumption that's going to stay slow for the rest of the year. And as we launch new products, we'll talk to you about them as we do with anything with NPI, and we can give you a perspective on how we think that product area may grow. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Great. Thanks. Just for the follow-up. The other part of the business that you would start to see slowing down would be the background screening area. And you seeing anything that's indicating that given the layoffs and stuff that you're hearing from some of the bigger technology companies that the polls are really starting to slow or significantly changing? Mark Begor : No, we're not. And remember, when you think about our business, is obviously different than the background screening industry because we're so new in kind of dealing with the industry. We have so much penetration opportunity. It's our view that even if the market slows, our ability to digitize and help background screeners digitize their businesses will mitigate if you will, or offset some of that is an add to new products that we'll be rolling out for the background screeners that include other data elements. So when an economic event happens, and there is some slowdown there, we think we'll be able to offset that with some of the new products as well as penetration because we're fairly new. Remember the TAM for that the talent and background screeners is about 4 billion. And our business is a couple of $100 million. So we've got the opportunity to continue to grow into the data elements of that even in an economic event. Operator : Thanks. Your next question is coming from Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners. Your line is now live. Craig Huber : Great. Thank you. Can you talk a little bit further about how you think your verification service business will do if we go into an elongated recession here? You guys adding more and more records here, a significant part of your business, how do you think it will do in longer recession? Mark Begor : Yes, I think we've been pretty clear. We think it will do pretty well. As we pointed out in the comments and in prior calls, you go back to 2008, 2009, which was a pretty brutal economic event, the toughest, I think we've seen in our lifetimes. It grew through that whole period. I think in 2008, it grew 17% or something like that. And now it's got more levers. Remember, back then, it was mostly a mortgage business. And now it's highly diversified in other verticals, government, talent, it's employer services business and then non-mortgage verticals inside of financial services. And the ability to add records is one of many levers that the business has that we think is what makes Equifax so different today versus our last economic event, if you want to call, 2008, 2009. Our ability to grow is significantly enhanced by workforce being such a big part of Equifax and having so many different levers that are either unaffected by a recession or allow them to actually benefit from a recession like the unemployment claims business. Craig Huber : And then also the 50% or so of records you get from outside the partnerships, you talk about the pitch there that you used to get those records of companies, et cetera. And then also if could you just also touch on the historical records that you've built up in your database, which I believe in total is like 25%, 30% of your revenues that you get is for a historical records, not the current person's employment? Mark Begor : Yes. So, first on the direct records that we have. Remember, it's the core of Workforce Solutions is what we call our Employer Services or Employer Solutions business. And that's where we deliver regulatory and compliance services to companies through their HR managers, and that's where they outsource these activities to Equifax. And that's about a $6 billion TAM. We have about a $400 million business there. And where we deliver those services like unemployment claims management for a company, we do the processing for them. I-9 verification in the onboarding side, work opportunity tax credit, employee retention tax credit. We do W-2 management for employees, meaning if someone needs a W-2, we will deliver it for them. So all those services that are outsourced by an HR manager is what we do as a business. And as you know, as I pointed out earlier, we've invested heavily in our cloud transformation to make those services and capabilities more efficient, more effective and just a better service for the HR manager. So the play there is to continue through our commercial coverage is to drive more outsourcing of those activities to Equifax. And for example, like in unemployment claims, we process either one in four or one in five unemployment claims in the United States that are done by third parties, meaning not individual companies. Most companies still do it today. So we have real scale in these businesses. And then as a part of that commercial relationship where we're delivering these regulatory services to the HR manager in a company, we also do income and employment verification for free. And they will deliver their payroll records to us. But then of course, we monetize. In return, we'll do income and employment verification securely. We'll do it with a high degree of privacy. And it allows the HR manager to outsource that activity to us, because if we're not doing it for them, they have a call center inside of their HR shop where they're doing it. And they are fielding calls from mortgage originators, auto lenders, background screeners, government agencies to verify income and employment on their employees. So we do that all for free. So, a very powerful value prop that we have for the HR manager, which is why we've developed a bunch of relationships. And that's why we're also expanding through M&A. And like LawLogix, a company that we announced this morning that we're acquiring strengthens us in the I-9 verification space and delivers records. So, those are the five or six acquisitions we've done in the last 24 months to strengthen our employer services business. It's really at the at the core of who Workforce Solutions is. So we want to continue to invest in technology and capabilities and bolt-on M&A to strengthen that because not only do we have a very attractive business growing in that $6 billion TAM, it also delivers records we can monetize very effectively. The second half of your question was around our historical records you're right on. It's a very big part of our business model. A lot of our verifications are around where does Mark work today, how much do you make today. But a lot of the verifications that one that needed and want to have historical data in order to complete the process and as you point out, we keep every record every week, every pay period. And we're now up to $570 million records, which as I mentioned earlier, equates to about 5.5 jobs from a job history status on the average American. In my case, it would be my Equifax records by Warbringers records and my GE records. So we have those historical records, and they are incredibly valuable. And it's a big part of the competitive position or moat, we have around the business is those historical records are a big part of that because the only way you can develop those is over time. And of course, we've been at this for a decade of building out the data set and maintaining all those records. John Gamble : And importantly, in nonmortgage verification services businesses, about 50% of the revenue is generated from transactions that involve a historical record, either historical records only or historical records and current record. So it's 50% penetration of historical records in the transaction. So very, very high and huge differentiation. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Simon Clinch from Atlantic Equities. Your line is now live. Mark Begor : Hey Simon. Simon Clinch : Hi. How are everyone? Thanks for taking my call -- my question here. I just wanted to cycle back to the comments you made about the outgrowth of the mortgage in EWS. And I was just wondering, in terms of how to think about the core growth generally that you outlined for Equifax overall. Historically, my understanding was that we should think of that as effectively a static opportunity versus the market that each of those segments play in. But it sounds like, we comments around EWS here that actually, they should be considered to be some level of beta, I guess, to the macro to the six [indiscernible] markets. Is that how we should think about things going forward? Mark Begor : Well, as John pointed out, we can hit it again, is that in the mortgage application process, there's a difference in this market than there is in a normal market. John pointed out that there's more consumers or homeowners that are -- when they're doing a home purchase that are doing shopping for rates. And generally, when a consumer does rate shopping, a credit file will be pulled by the mortgage originator and make sure that consumer can qualify for the mortgage that they're re-shopping on, and then they'll deliver some kind of a response around what rate they can deliver. And the consumer will hit a bunch of mortgage companies in this higher rate environment in order to check rates. And that results in credit holes, which is good for USIS and part of their outperformance, if you will, of the number of poles that they have. Conversely in workforce when you're rate shopping, they don't pull income and employment until further into the application process. It might be when an application is actually filed versus rate shopping. And of course, it's always pulled during the closing of the application. I think John was pointing out a change from a more normal mortgage environment because of rate shopping benefits the credit file and somewhat doesn't benefit the income and employment data. Now of course, Workforce Solutions has all the levers to perform the mortgage market, it starts with as we add more records, we have higher hit rates. So they get more revenue as they add records and records are up 22%. So that's a benefit for them. In any mortgage environment that's still benefiting them today. New products are benefiting them, fuel prices. We did a price increase in January. So that's benefiting their business penetration is still a benefit. Remember, they're only seeing what now, 65% of mortgages, a little over 60% a little over 60% of mortgages. So as they get out there and remember the credit file is used in virtually every mortgage, because it's been around for 50, 60, 70 years, so the ability to drive commercially into those mortgage originators that are not using in our income and employment data from Workforce Solutions. And then as we point out, system-to-system integrations, which have grown dramatically, but there's still a lot of web access. And we know that with web access, we don't get every application from mortgage originators. They're doing manual verification. So you've got multiple levers for workforce to continue to outperform the mortgage market, be it at a bit lower level than in a normal environment. Simon Clinch : Okay. Yes. I understand that. And then just when I'm thinking about the entries to the up and the down here. Is it -- would it be fair for me to take the how you've reduced your guidance for revenues and the subsequent flow through to EBITDA. Like if there was mortgage upside, should I expect that same high-level of incremental margin drop through. Mark Begor : Yes. Any change in revenue is high incremental margin up or down? And I think as we pointed out earlier, we've opted to continue to invest in the second half for the future of Equifax. So meaning, as our mortgage revenue came down, we're not taking costs out. We're focusing on redeploying some costs or still continuing to invest going forward. I don't know, John, would you add to that? We see very high variable margins on the upside and the downside. They aren't necessarily always exactly the same for the reasons that Mark indicated, but the variable margins on our revenues are certainly quite high. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Seth Weber from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now live. Seth Weber : Everybody good morning and thanks for taking my question. I actually had a similar question on the margin side. I heard the comments about some increased spending as for the second quarter and through the back half of the year. I was just wondering if you could give us any additional color on what this increased spending is, if that's opportunistic or -- is this kind of the new normal sort of framework that we should be thinking about from a margin perspective? Thanks. Mark Begor : A couple of layers in there. So we still are confident in our plan to increase our margins, so no change in our outlook for 2025 or 39%. No change in the cost benefits that we're going to deliver this year, next year, 2023 from the cloud transformation, no change in the broader margin expansion. In the near-term, we are continuing to invest in new products. Obviously, we're still investing in completing the cloud transformation. We have some additional investments on onboarding. Some of the new partnerships we have for records and Workforce Solutions. So we're continuing to do opportunistic or may be targeted as a better term investments that we think will benefit 2023, 2024, 2025 in 2022. And so there's no question we're doing that. Would you add to that, John? John Gamble : Yes, just current margins, and we talked about it on the call, right, are being significantly impacted by the large reduction in mortgage, right, and our very high variable margins. So if the question was, has this been the new level of your margins? No, as Mark just said, we expect our margins to reaccelerate as the market recovers. But in terms of the exact pace of that reacceleration, we'll give you guidance on that as we get into each individual year. Seth Weber : Okay. And then just as a follow-up, the guidance for international margin for the year implies a pretty big step-up in the second half versus the first half. Is there something there? Is it just seasonality? Is there something from lower tech transformation spending or something like that, that's happening in the second half versus the first in international? Thanks. John Gamble : So, historically, you've seen international margins are generally higher in the second half than the first. So we've seen some of that. But we try to be clear on the call that in terms of the level of acceleration in the margins in international. There is some pressure on that because of the fact we're seeing great growth in our debt management business, but that does have lower margins. So we do expect to see the improvement we talked about, but there is a little bit of pressure on those margins because of debt management. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Mark Begor : Hey Heather. Heather Balsky : Hi. Thank you for squeezing me in. Just a follow-up on Toni's question earlier regarding outperformance on the mortgage side for EWS. I'm curious where the softer mortgage market, and it sounds like it's a little bit of a lighter outperformance outlook. Where that lightness is coming from, sort of what is the toggle, sort of, we grow mortgage market that flows through to that outperformance? Thanks. John Gamble : Yes. So in terms of the drivers of outperformance, it's actually -- the Workforce is actually performing better than our expectations. They've added records faster than we thought. And so that's actually a greater benefit to our performance than we would have expected when we started the year, and they've executed very well on both new products, and then the pricing programs they put in place at the beginning of the year, which tend to go in, in January. So we know about all those, right? The issue -- the reason why the outperformance looks lower than what we saw last quarter is two-fold. One is because all of those factors I just described are all variable with volume. So since volume is declining, like that level of outperformance in absolute dollar shrinks. So that's why you see a smaller outperformance relative to the market because -- and it's just the math and the measurement. The other thing is what Mark talked about, right? We measure the mortgage market. We define it right, as USIS credit inquiries. While since USIS credit inquiries are benefited by shopping and Workforce Solutions isn't benefited by shopping to the same degree, then what we end up having is USIS gets somewhat of a benefit. And so, therefore, the market itself is measured as stronger and that provides a little bit of a greater headwind to outperformance to EWS. We don't think that's -- that in any way indicates they're not performing as well. They're performing extremely well. And as I said, the actual drivers they can control. They're actually outperforming our expectations in terms of record additions products and then obviously, good execution on price. And as Mark mentioned, they're also doing very, very well on system-to-system integration. So we feel very good about the execution that's occurring during the year. Heather Balsky : Thank you. And as a follow-up, just given the strong price performance in the market and your expectation next year for a much stronger free cash flow and returning cash to investors, what are your thoughts regarding using your balance sheet today to potentially return cash versus waiting for next year? Thanks. Mark Begor : Yes, it's a great question. We certainly think about it, Heather, but we think the timing is not right for us to do that. As you know, we announced this morning another bolt-on acquisition, which we think will benefit Equifax quite strongly going forward. And we're still digesting some of the M&A we did in 2021. So, it's certainly on our mind when the time is right to return cash to shareholders, both through restarting our dividend and doing a buyback, we don't think the time is right today. But it's coming. As we look to 2023, 2024, 2025 with our margins expanding and our free cash flow expanding, we clearly believe we have ample resources to invest in that bolt-on M&A, but also have excess cash in the future to return to shareholders, and we'll do that at the right time. Heather Balsky : Great. Thank you for the -- thanks. Operator : Thanks. Your next question is coming from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Mark Begor : Hey, George. George Tong : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. In the mortgage space, new purchase originations have been declining relatively sharply in recent months. What assumptions around new purchase oil. Are you inventing in your 46% plus mortgage volume decline forecast for the second half of this year? And how would you frame the downside risk to your forecast? John Gamble : Yes. So in terms of the way we structure the forecast, we obviously look very closely at the current trends we're seeing. We obviously looked very closely at the last 14 days, right, when we're seeing in early July, and we saw we were down 40%. And we also look very closely at the trends we're seeing and the movements in increase between April, May and June. We think that the forecast that we put together or the estimate we used in our financial guidance is very consistent with what we're seeing in terms of movements in the mortgage market itself. We think it's very consistent with the information we shared on new home purchases and the fact that they're certainly weakening as we go through the year relative to what we've seen earlier in the year, we think it's consistent with that. We think it's also consistent with the very low levels of refinance that are currently occurring and really that refinances at this point, almost completely driven by cash out refi. Also, I think you saw last night that all three of the major parties that forecast mortgage originations refreshed their forecast yesterday evening, Freddie, Fannie and MBA. MBA came out and said they expect originations to be down in the neighborhood of 43.5% and I think all three indicated those origination units, sorry. And I think all three indicated that origination dollars will be down in the order of 46% in the second half. So, we feel like with us indicating you're going to see over 46% reduction in inquiries, which would imply a 200 to 300 basis points, so I think 48% to 50% decline in origination units. We think we've given a very reasonable forecast, we think it's consistent with other third party forecasters. And so, we feel like we've done a fairly good job at encompassing the information we have today. But obviously, to be fair, very hard to forecast the mortgage market and what we'll do is we'll just keep letting you know what we're seeing. And then any changes that we're seeing that that might drive in our output. But, right now, we feel like we've done a nice job of including all the information available, and we feel relatively good about the fact that the other parties have come out and look to be at or slightly stronger than us. George Tong : Got it. That's helpful. Gross margins in the quarter fell 210 bps year-over-year. How much additional gross margin pressure do you expect with input cost inflation trends and changes in revenue mix? John Gamble : Yes, I think the big driver, obviously, for us, what's occurring right now is the impact of mortgage market overall, right? And our -- there really is any inflation impact, George, from our perspective in that margin. It's really the loss of that mortgage revenue is just a big impact on us. That's all. George Tong : Got it. Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Jeff Meuler from Baird. Your line is now live. Jeff Meuler : Yes. Thank you. So I understand the argument that Equifax on a consolidated basis, including the recession resistance and countercyclical businesses is relatively resilient. I guess, I was surprised that you said that even in your recession-impacted businesses. Do you think they could potentially be flat at the high end of the range in a recession. So -- could you flesh out the argument behind that for us? I'm guessing the short answer is NPI and the other structural growth drivers in verifier. But help us understand how you could potentially be flat in those businesses in a recession? Mark Begor : Yes, I'm not sure when I said that or John said that, Jeff, that we didn't intend to say that. So when we think about our view of Equifax today versus the last recession, we think we're much better positioned. It starts with Workforce being so much larger than it was before. And kind of broadly in Workforce as we point out in 2008, 2009, it grew 17% when Equifax was down 6% and it was a very small business in the scheme of Equifax, and it's got more levers today. So we think workforce is positioned to grow in a recession because of all those levers. So we're very clear on that. And with that being approaching 50% of Equifax, that's a big factor. We talked about identity and fraud being kind of a business that we expect to grow through a recession just because of the digital macro is benefiting there. There's a couple of businesses that are quite uniquely positive in a recession like our unemployment claims business, which is part of workforce. So those are kind of 60% of Equifax. And then the 40% as kind of the rest, which is our credit business is primarily international and USIS. And those are generally impacted negatively by a recession. Inside of that negative impact, I think I tried to say that the negative of prescreens and volume coming down and originations coming down is dampened somewhat not offset, but dampened somewhat by account management increasing by credit line actions and line management actions increasing. So there's more volume there. But we would expect those to have some pressure. Now you also got to think about the timing of the recession, as you point out, which is different in Equifax today than 2008, 2009, if you think a recession is going to be in 2023, for example, we've got unique levers we didn't have in 2008, 2009. We're in the throes of completing our cloud transformation. And the cost savings that come from that are not impacted by the recession. We're going to execute the cloud transformation, the benefits that 250 basis points is going to flow through. As you also point out, new products is a different game at Equifax today than it was in 2008 and 2009. The kind of focus, the resources and the vitality we're delivering, that's going to benefit us in a recession, having more solutions in market and being cloud native. So those are benefits. And then the fourth point I hit earlier in our comments was around M&A. The acquisitions we've made in the last 24 months, which, as you know, is well above historical trends, meaning we've done a bunch of M&A of 11 acquisitions, over $3 billion of TEV. Those are in our run rate revenue, but the synergies are kicking in the latter part of 2022, 2023, 2024. So that's going to be a positive for us as we think about the recession. So those are all the factors we put together. We haven't done a revenue, EBITDA, EPS forecast on a recession, but we've tried to share with you some of the factors we think about that are positive and negative, and there's a whole bunch more positives at Equifax certainly today than there was in the last economic event. Jeff Meuler : Thank you. Mark Begor : Those recession impact the businesses would decline, right? So, yes. Jeff Meuler : Got it. Thank you. Mark Begor : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live. Faiza Alwy : Yes. Hi. Good morning. Thank you. My first question, I just wanted to clarify on the margin impact of mortgages and product development costs. Are you able to size the incremental product development costs? Because it seems like your overall EPS guidance is a lot lower than I would have thought, just given the implied revenue decline from mortgages? So I'm curious on how big of an impact their incremental impact there is from product development costs? And are these new products something that you had planned to invest in, in 2023? And is that something that you're maybe pulling forward this year? John Gamble : So by far, the largest impact in the reduction in our adjusted EPS, we tried to walk through the drivers, right? But in terms of the margin piece, right, outside of interest and outside of the impact of FX, right? By far, the largest driver is obviously the reduction in mortgage and mortgage has very high variable profit, right? So, that's what's really driving the reduction in our margin dollars and, therefore, driving the reduction in our adjusted EPS. And yes, there is some incremental cost that we're investing going forward in as we invest going forward in new products, but that's not the driver. The driver is really the movement in mortgage, right? What we were trying to do is to give you a perspective on there's a substantial driver, and there are some other things that are impacting margins as well. We talked about investments in the development costs. We talked about some mix issues in international as we grow the debt management business. And we also talked about the fact that we had a little bit of a benefit because our variable compensation goes down. We're just trying to give you a perspective on the different side levers that are playing within a larger impact of the decline in the mortgage market. Faiza Alwy : Got it. Okay. Thank you for that. And then just as a follow-up, I'm curious if Experian talked about how their now Fannie Mae have certified them for day one certainty. And I'm curious how you think about that? Like is that relevant or important? Like, are there any consideration for your business at all? Mark Begor : Sure. It's Mark here. We're aware that Experian is doing some work and investing around the income and employment space. We don't see them commercially yet, meaning that we haven't seen any impacts from their work that they've done. They've got a -- our understanding is a very small data set compared to our 144 million records or 110 million actives. And so we just haven't seen an impact. That said, it hasn't slowed us down in our investments in technology and products. And of course, in our M&A focus we're one of our priorities, one of our top priorities around M&A is to strengthen Workforce Solutions to ensure that we continue to build the moat and the competitive position around the business. And including the acquisition we announced this morning of LawLogix making that business stronger. So we're clearly focused on continuing to build out Workforce, which is our largest and fastest-growing business. John Gamble : In addition to Equifax, there have been multiple companies that have had day one certainty for several years. Mark Begor : Yes, for one. John Gamble : So, this is not anything new. Operator : Thank you We reach the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Trevor for any further or closing remarks. Trevor Burns : No, I just want to say thanks for everybody for joining the call. If you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to reach out and have a great day. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Trevor Burns, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Investor Relations. Thank you, you may begin. Trevor Burns : Thanks and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Trevor Burns. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the IR Calendar section of the News & Events tab at our IR website, www.investor.equifax.com. During the call, we will be making reference to certain materials that can also be found in the Presentations section of the News & Events tab at our IR website. These materials are labeled Q3 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Also, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including fourth quarter and full year 2022 guidance to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors that may impact our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2021 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. We will also be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and can be found in the Financial Results section of the Financial Info tab at our IR website. Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark, beginning on Slide 4. Mark Begor : Thanks, Trevor. Equifax delivered another solid quarter with continued execution against our EFX 2025 strategic priorities in a challenging economic environment. Third quarter revenue of $1.244 billion was up 2% or 4% in constant currency and was above the high end of our guidance driven by strong non-mortgage revenue growth in the quarter. This strong revenue performance was well above our July framework and delivered despite a more negative FX environment than we expected, which at 200 basis points or $29 million was a $5 million or about 50 basis point greater headwind for FX than we expected when we put out July guidance. Adjusted EPS of $1.73 per share was also stronger than our July guidance. We are continuing to significantly outperform our underlying markets as we navigate the challenging economic environment and mortgage market decline. Our global non-mortgage businesses, which now represent over 78% of total Equifax revenue, were very strong with 20% total and 13% organic non-mortgage, constant currency dollar revenue growth, stronger than we expected when we provided guidance in July and stronger than our 8% to 12% long-term growth framework. We're now tracking to 20% non-mortgage constant dollar growth in 2022, which is up about a 100 basis points from our July guidance. The outperformance was again led by outstanding performance at Workforce Solutions that delivered 40% total and 20% organic non-mortgage revenue growth. USIS B2B non-mortgage grew 9% online and 5% total, which was about consistent with second quarter, but weaker than we expected. International delivered a record quarter up a very strong 17% constant dollar growth and 15% organic constant dollar growth well above our expectations. Equifax total mortgage revenue is down 30% about as expected and outperformed the underlying market decline by over 10 points from pricing, new TWN records, penetrations, system-to-system integrations and new products. The U.S. mortgage market as expected weakened substantially in the third quarter with originations estimated at down 50% in the quarter, which was about 9 points weaker than our July guidance. As a reminder, Workforce Solutions mortgage revenue is more closely tied to originations. USIS mortgage credit inquiries were down 41% in the quarter and better than our expectations from increased shopping activity despite the weaker than expected mortgage originations. We're continuing to see higher than normal levels of shopping, which continued throughout the quarter and tends to benefit USIS credit file pool. Combined, the negative mortgage market impact on Equifax was about as expected as the more negative market impact from originations on EWS was offset by the less negative impact on USIS from increased shopping activity. We saw continued weakening of the mortgage market as we moved through September into the first few weeks of October as mortgage rates continued to rise to their highest level since 2008. We now expect mortgage originations to decline over 60% in the fourth quarter versus our July framework of 48% and USIS credit inquiries to decline over 50% versus our July guidance of 46%. John will talk about our updated mortgage framework in a minute. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $405 million and was flat compared to last year. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 32.5% were slightly below our expectations for the quarter, principally due to higher sales and marketing expenses driven by our outperformance in non-mortgage verticals. John will walk you through our margin performance in the third quarter and expectations for fourth quarter later in the presentation. We continue to make significant progress executing the EFX Cloud data and technology transformation. We're now approaching 70% of North America and 60% of total EFX revenue being delivered from the new EFX Cloud. Our focus for the remainder of 2022 and 2023 is accelerating full customer migrations in North America to enable decommissioning of our applications in data centers. Our new EFX Cloud infrastructure is delivering always on capabilities and faster new product innovation with integrated data sets, faster data delivery and industry-leading enterprise level security. We're convinced that our EFX Cloud and single data fabric will provide a competitive advantage to Equifax for years to come. We're in the early days of leveraging our new EFX Cloud infrastructure and single data fabric and are seeing acceleration of innovation in new product rollouts. Our new product Vitality Index of 14% in the quarter is a record and over 500 basis points improvement from our 9% Vitality Index last year and well above our 10% long-term goal for Vitality. As a reminder, our Vitality Index is the percentage of revenue derived from new products launched in the past three years. Our strong momentum on NPI rollouts leveraging the new EFX Cloud allowed us to raise our full year Vitality Index outlook for 2022 for the second time this year from 11% to 13%, which is up 300 basis points from our long-term framework and from the framework we started earlier this year. This strong NPI performance gives us momentum into 2023 as most new products reach commercial maturity in years two and three. In third quarter, we continue to execute our bolt-on acquisition strategy completing two acquisitions, LawLogix, which will further strengthen Workforce Solutions Onboarding and I-9 Solutions and Midigator, which will strengthen Kount and broaden our identity in fraud franchise. These are our 11th and 12th bolt-on acquisitions since January, 2021 and aligned with our M&A strategy to strengthen Workforce Solutions, our largest and fastest growing business, add unique and differentiated data and expand into fast growing identity and fraud market. Bolt-on acquisitions that broaden and strengthen Equifax are strong levers for future growth and are central to our long-term growth framework to add a 100 to 200 basis points annually to our revenue growth from strategic bolt-on M&A. Our guidance for 2022 revenue of just under $5.1 billion is essentially unchanged from the framework we provided in July. Third quarter revenue was stronger than our July guidance by about $25 million. Our current guidance reflects a decline in fourth quarter from our prior implied view by about $25 million from the weaker mortgage market and FX. The continued weakening in the U.S. mortgage market is negatively impacting fourth quarter revenue by about $45 million and negative FX is impacting revenue in the fourth quarter by about $15 million. Partially offsetting this $60 million negative impact is stronger non-mortgage revenue and Workforce Solutions in international and the acquired revenue from LawLogix and Midigator. The strong 20% constant dollar non-mortgage growth in 2022 gives us great momentum as we look to 2023 and a bottoming of the mortgage market in the coming quarters. Our guidance for adjusted EPS of $7.54 a share is down about $0.13 from the midpoint of our July guidance. As our third quarter adjusted EPS was about $0.8 per share stronger than our July guidance, this results in a reduction in the fourth quarter from our implied EPS of about $0.21 a share or about $33 million in pre-tax income. The most significant drivers of this reduction in EPS are first the $45 million reduction in higher margin fourth quarter mortgage revenue due to the weakening mortgage market, which more than drives this level of reduction in pre-tax income and second higher interest expense. These negative impacts were partially offset by stronger non-mortgage growth and the addition of acquisition related non-mortgage revenue from LawLogix and Midigator and again John will provide details on fourth quarter and full year guidance shortly. We were very pleased with our continued very strong constant dollar non-mortgage revenue growth of 20% total and 13% organic, which is well above our 8% to 12% long-term framework and our ability to outperform the underlying mortgage market as shown by our third quarter results. Turning to Slide 5 a critical de-lever of our strategic priorities is a continued expansion of our addressable market data sources and revenue. Equifax is much more than a credit bureau today and our addressable TAM has expanded 3x to over $45 billion. Over the past several years we've expanded into faster growing markets outside financial services and mortgage. These faster growing markets include identity and fraud, talent management, government and employer services verticals. This has accelerated our growth outside of financial services and mortgage and increased the resiliency and diversity of EFX by broadening our revenue streams, including markets that are expected to deliver future growth at levels above our traditional markets. As shown on this slide since 2019, we've grown our total non-mortgage business by over $1.1 billion with a combined CAGR since 2019 of 12%, which is at the high end of our 8% to 12% long-term growth framework. In 2022 we expect non-mortgage revenue to represent over 75% of total Equifax revenue. In the fourth quarter, it will be well over 80%. Also, since 2019, we've grown our non-credit bureau based revenues by $1.5 billion or a very strong CAGR of about 30% to over half of Equifax total revenue. This is led by our $2.4 billion Workforce Solutions business, which is up $1.4 billion since 2019 at a very strong CAGR of about 35%, but also supported by strong double-digit growth in identity and fraud from Kount and Midigator as well as strong growth in debt services. We've also completed 12 acquisitions since 2021 that are all in the non-mortgage space and are delivering strong double-digit growth. Workforce Solutions strong above market growth and verticals like Employer Solutions, Talent and Government, our expansion into identity and fraud and our focus on new product investments, coupled with our bolt-on acquisitions focused on non-mortgage priorities will continue to accelerate the growth of these non-credit and non-mortgage revenue streams at Equifax. Turning to Slide 6 in the third quarter, Equifax core revenue growth, the green section of the bars grew a very strong 16% reported and 19% in constant currency, which was consistent with our July guidance. Constant dollar core revenue, organic revenue growth of 14% in the quarter was also substantially above the organic growth in our long-term financial framework of 7% to 10%. Non-mortgage constant dollar organic revenue growth of 13% drove three quarters of the organic constant dollar core growth in the quarter. Core mortgage outperformance predominantly in EWS drove the remainder of the core organic constant dollar revenue growth. We continue to expect strong core revenue growth of 17% total and 19% in constant currency in 2022, which again is well above our 8% to 12% long-term growth framework and 300 basis points higher than the core growth for 2022 provided last November at our Investor Day. This strong constant currency growth is driven by stronger non-mortgage revenue growth of 20% total and 13% in organic due to broad-based performance across Workforce Solutions and strength in International. As detailed on Slide 7, U.S. mortgage revenue was down about 30% in the quarter. This compares to third quarter mortgage originations of down 57% as estimated by mortgage industry, third parties and USIS credit inquiries that declined 41%. As a reminder in a rising rate environment, we believe consumers tend to rate short more frequently, creating a favorable variance between mortgage credit inquiries and originations that benefits USIS credit file pole from shopping. In the third quarter, we saw mortgage credit inquiries perform on the order of 16 points better than the change in the estimated mortgage originations. USIS revenue declined 35% in the quarter, about 6 points better than credit inquiries. However, TWN income and employment is typically pulled later in the mortgage application process and at closing. As a result, EWS does not benefit as much from the upfront shopping trend that occurs in a rising rate environment as TWN inquiries are more closely aligned with completed mortgage originations. TWN mortgage revenue declined 28% in the quarter. EWS core mortgage revenue growth that was up a strong 14% in the quarter and when adjusting for the 16 point negative spread between mortgage inquiries and originations was up a very strong 30% and consistent with prior quarters. Overall, Equifax mortgage revenue outperformed USIS credit inquiries by 11% or 11 points in the quarter and outperformed estimated mortgage originations by a strong 27 points in the quarter. This reflects the strength of our U.S. enterprise mortgage sales and operations team that bring the combined USIS and EWS products and solutions to market in this challenging mortgage macro. Turning to Slide 8, Workforce Solutions delivered another outstanding quarter with 32% core revenue growth, driven by very strong non-mortgage, non-UC & ERC growth of 62%. As a reminder, non-mortgage revenue is now about 70% of Workforce Solutions and a big Workforce Solutions driver for future growth from their fast growing talent and government verticals. Workforce Solutions above market 32% core growth in the quarter continues to be driven by very strong performance on TWN record additions, new products and pricing, system-to-system integrations and greater penetration. Their market outperformance is very strong, particularly in a period of declining market transaction volumes for mortgage. We expect to see continued very strong core growth in fourth quarter from Workforce Solutions. Rudy Ploder and the Workforce Solutions team continue outstanding execution across their key growth drivers detailed on the right hand side of this slide. Over the past 12 months, we've signed 10 new agreements with payroll processors in the U.S., including three new agreements in the third quarter that will be added to the TWN database over the next several quarters. These new partnerships, along with continued growth in our direct contributors through our employers services business are delivering continued strong growth in the TWN database with current records up 16% reaching 146 million current records in the third quarter. Their 111 million unique individuals in TWN deliver very high hit rates and represent over two-thirds of the 165 million U.S. non-farm payroll. And as a reminder, about 50% of our TWN records are contributed directly from individual employers that we have long relationships with. The remaining are contributed through partnerships principally with payroll companies. In addition to traditional W2 wage earners we estimate there are approximately $30 million to $40 million gig workers and 20 million to 30 million pensioners in the U.S. who will also bring valuable income and employment insights to lenders, background screeners and government agencies. We've recently signed an agreement with a payroll processor to gain access to their pensioner records and we have an active pipeline with other companies to acquire new pension records to the TWN database. We're in the very early innings of collecting records on these 50 million to 70 million gig and pensioner records, but expect to make significant progress as we move through 2023 and beyond. TWN record additions will continue to drive Workforce Solutions revenue going forward from higher hit rates and we have the ability to double our records in the future to the roughly 220 million total W2, gig and pension recipients in the United States. This is an incredibly powerful lever for future growth at Workforce Solutions and a key driver of their 13% to 15% long-term growth outlook. Turning to Slide 9 with some more detail on Workforce Solutions, they really had an exceptional quarter delivering revenue of $559 million. Revenue was up a strong 9% with overall organic revenue growth of about flat overall despite the significant 28% decline in EWS mortgage revenue in the quarter. Non-mortgage revenue was up a very strong 40% and is now 70% of Workforce Solutions. Verification services revenue of $455 million was up 13% more than offsetting the 57% decline in estimated mortgage originations. Non-mortgage verticals now represent over 60% of Verifier revenue and delivered 72% total and 30% organic growth. The Insights business which we acquired late last year continues to perform very well driven by strong performance in their largest verticals, Risk Intelligence and Justice. Risk Intelligence helps background screeners analyze peoples risks via background checks and continuous monitoring. Justice Intelligence helps channel partners assist law enforcement agencies in their investigations. Talent and Government Solutions, which now represent almost 40% of Verifier non-mortgage had outstanding quarters. Talent Solutions delivered a 110% total in over 50% organic growth in the quarter from record growth pricing and strong new product rollouts. We also saw strong growth in the government vertical with revenue up 90% total and 44% organic driven by strong penetration at the state level. The EWS government vertical is benefiting from penetration, pricing, record growth and leveraging a strong product portfolio, including Insights data at the federal, state and local levels across the United States. The continued expansion of Workforce Solutions data hub through our new Total Verify Solution is driving very strong growth in the fast growing 5 billion Talent and 2 billion Government markets. Our total Verifier Solution is enabling our customers to access multi-data solutions derived from an unparalleled set of differentiated information assets spanning employment, income, education, incarceration, health credentialing and identity. As of the third quarter, EWS has over 580 million total records in the TWN database, both current and historic that provide both current and previous employment information on individuals allowing us to increasingly provide an instant digital resume or employment verification on both current and historical job histories. The non-mortgage EWS consumer lending business principally in card, auto and consumer finance and led by our U.S. Enterprise sales teams also showed good growth with revenue up 18% in the quarter. Employer services revenue of $104 million was down 7% due to the expected decline in our unemployment claims in employer retention credit businesses. We expected total UC & ERC revenue to be down about 20% in 2022, driven by the lower jobless claims and ERC transactions as the COVID federal tax program runs out. Employer services revenue excluding UC & ERC was up a strong 29% in the quarter driven by broad based double-digit growth in our I-9 and Onboarding, healthy FX and our tax credit businesses. We are increasingly seeing the ability to deliver bundled packages of our differentiated Employer Services Solutions to customers. In the third quarter, we signed a large multiyear agreement to provide a broad suite of EWS solutions, including I-9, W4, Tax Services and other HR Solutions to a large multinational company with annual guaranteed Workforce Solutions revenues approaching $20 million with total annual revenue opportunities with the agreement of over $30 million. Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margins of 29.5% were lower than our July guidance and the over 50% margins we expect from EWS on an ongoing basis. The main drivers of the lower than expected margin was negative mix due to lower mortgage revenue, higher sales and marketing costs principally due to very strong non-mortgage revenue growth and costs to add the new TWN contributors I talked about earlier. The decline in EBITDA margins versus last year was driven by similar factors including negative product margin mix as higher margin mortgage declined as a percentage of revenue and was replaced with Verifier non-mortgage revenue and revenue from the most recent acquisitions, which at this point have lower margins than Verifier overall. And second, increased marketing and sales expense from both investments to drive NPI and driven by our extremely strong non-mortgage sales and record acquisition performance. And then last, as I mentioned, cost related to Onboarding new TWN contributors. We expect these same factors to impact EWS margins in fourth quarter as we see further declines in mortgage revenue with EWS EBITDA margins of about 48.5% in fourth quarter. As we look to 2023, we expect to see EWS margins return to above 50% as product and pricing initiatives expand profitability and we see additional savings from their cloud transformation. The strength of EWS and uniqueness and value of their TWN income and employment data in Employer Services businesses were clear again in the third quarter. Rudy Ploder and the EWS team delivered another above market quarter with 9% revenue growth and 32% core growth and are well positioned to deliver a very strong 2022 and continue above market growth in the future. As shown on Slide 10, USIS revenue of about $397 million were down 9% and slightly better than our expectations. USIS mortgage revenue was down about 35% and was also better than expected with a 41% decline in credit inquiries versus the 46% we had expected. At $97 million mortgage revenue is now about 25% of total USIS revenue. B2B non-mortgage revenue was $250 million, which represents over 60% of total USIS revenue and was up 5% with organic revenue growth of 3%. This was below the low end of the 67% growth we discussed in July. Importantly, B2B non-mortgage online revenue growth remained strong at 9% total and 6% organic, a sign that lenders continue to originate. During the quarter we saw double-digit growth in commercial and telco and solid single digit growth across financial services, auto and insurance offset by a decline in our direct-to-consumer business. Kount, which provides unique identity and fraud solutions continues to execute very well, developing joint solutions, leveraging both Kount and Equifax data with 2022 global revenue expected to exceed 20%. The recent acquisition of Midigator will continue to strengthen our identity and fraud franchise and growth. The weakness relative to expectations in the quarter was again in financial marketing services, our B2B offline business that has revenue of $51 million, down 8% and lower than our expectations. As we discussed in previous quarters, the principle driver of decline in FMS Services was our fraud and data services vertical where we provide header data principally to providers of identity and fraud services and to a much lesser extent in our risk management and portfolio review business where we provide data and analytical services to financial institutions to evaluate the health of their existing portfolios or in some cases portfolios they're acquiring. As we discussed in prior quarters, we expect the declines in these businesses to continue through the fourth quarter with improvements in 2023 as we introduce new products, leveraging unique and differentiated data assets available through the new Equifax single data fabric. We also saw a decline in batch marketing services where we provide data and decisioning principally to financial institutions for pre-screeners as well as delivering our IXI data for marketing activities as some customers cut back on originations. We had seen high single digit growth in marketing services in the first half, so this is the first signs of any pullback in marketing. For fourth quarter B2B non-mortgage, we expect online to continue to be strong with growth rates above third quarter from commercial execution as well as progress in pricing and new product rollouts that overcome a somewhat slower growth in financial services. We expect financial marketing services to continue to be weak down over 10% with declines across header, risk and marketing continuing in the fourth quarter. Overall for B2B non-mortgage, we expect fourth quarter organic revenue growth to be about the levels we saw in the third quarter. USIS consumer solutions business had revenue of $50 million, down 1% in the quarter, but up 2% sequentially. We expect fourth quarter revenue to grow again sequentially with positive growth rates in the fourth quarter. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 34.1% in the quarter and slightly below our expectations principally due to continued investments in sales resources focused on non-mortgage growth. International revenue as shown on Slide 11 was up $288 million, up a very strong 17% on a local currency basis and 15% on a non-organic constant currency basis. We're seeing broad based execution from our international businesses. Europe local currency revenue was up 24%, principally driven by over 75% growth in our UK debt management business. We've seen significant increases in debt placements from the UK Government over the past several quarters. Our European CRA revenue accelerated in the third quarter with revenue of 7% and above our expectations, driven by broad-based product execution across our B2B online products and identity and fraud, slightly offset by lower consumer revenue. Asia Pacific, which is principally our Australia-New Zealand business, delivered local currency revenue of 6% driven by strong growth in our commercial and identity and fraud businesses and to a lesser extent growth in consumer. Latin America local currency revenue was up a strong 34% driven by double-digit growth in Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Ecuador and Central America. The team's new product introductions over the past three years and pricing actions continued to drive strong growth across all product lines. This is the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for Latin America. Canada local currency revenue was up 12% and above our expectations. We saw growth in commercial, analytics solutions, decisioning and identity and fraud revenue, which was partially offset by some one-time revenue in the quarter from mortgage volume declines. Consumer revenue also returned to growth during the quarter. We expect mid-single digit revenue growth from Canada in the fourth quarter. International adjusted EBITDA margins at 26.8% were down 200 basis point -- down 210 basis points sequentially and above our expectations given strong revenue growth. EBITDA margins were up slightly versus last year, but up about 150 basis points adjusting for the loss of equity income from the Russian joint venture that we sold. As shown on Slide 12, we had a very strong new product quarter with Vitality Index at 14%, which is our highest Vitality Index ever, and it was over 500 basis points above last year's results and 400 basis points above our 10% long-term growth framework for Vitality. We've delivered about 80 new products so far in 2022 leveraging our new EFX Cloud capabilities. We now expect to deliver Vitality Index of 13% in 2022, up 200 basis points from our previous guide of 11%, which equates to over $650 million of new product revenue in the year. The growth in our 2022 Vitality Index is principally coming from Workforce Solutions, which is encouraging as they are further along in completing their cloud transformation. It's positive to see the strong NPI results in the early innings of the Equifax Cloud. New products leveraging our differentiated data, our new Equifax cloud capabilities and single data fabric are central to our long-term growth framework and driving future Equifax top line growth. This week at the Annual Mortgage Bankers Association Conference, we will showcase a new offering that delivers telecommunications, pay TV and utilities attributes alongside the traditional mortgage credit report to help streamline the mortgage underwriting process, delivering telco, pay TV and utilities attributes to mortgage lenders alongside the traditional credit reports will also help expand access to credit and help create greater home ownership opportunities for U.S. consumers. The use of these expanded data insights can also provide visibility to millions of credit invisible consumers, those without traditional credit files, and enhance the financial profiles of thin, young and unscorable consumers as they complete their first mortgage applications. This new offering leveraging the Equifax Cloud will provide powerful new insights that help to automate, save time and resources and streamline the first mortgage process for every applicant, creating more opportunities for consumers to secure a loan. And Equifax is the first and only in the industry to offer these unique insights to the mortgage industry. Turning the Slide 13, we outlined the 12 strategic bolt-on acquisitions we've completed since January 2021 we expect will deliver over $450 million of principally non-mortgage run rate revenue. As you know, our 8% to 12% long-term growth framework includes 1% to 2% of annual revenue growth from strategic bolt on M&A aligned around our three strategic priorities. First, expanding and strengthening Workforce Solutions, our fastest growing and most profitable business. Second, building out our identity fraud capabilities and third, adding unique data assets. And with that, I'll turn it over to John to provide more details on the mortgage market, and our fourth quarter and full year 2022 guidance. John Gamble : Thanks Mark. As Mark mentioned and as shown on Slide 14, our guidance reflects and expectations the decline in the U.S. mortgage market will steepen in the fourth quarter with mortgage originations declining over 60% and mortgage credit inquiries declining over 50%. This is a significant reduction from our expectations in July and as Mark referenced earlier, this expectation of a further weakening of the mortgage market negatively impacts 4Q revenue by almost $45 million. 3Q mortgage revenue was 21.9% of total Equifax revenues compared to 29.5% and 24.7% in 1Q 2022, and 2Q 2022 respectively. In 4Q, we expect mortgage revenue to be about 16% of total Equifax revenues. The rapidly changing and unprecedented macro environment makes forecasting the impacts on the U.S. mortgage market incredibly challenging. We will continue to be transparent with you about changes in the mortgage market and the impacts on our business. EBITDA margins at 32.5% were slightly below the level of at or below 33% we discussed in our July guidance. Mark discussed the drivers in HBU [ph]. Partially offsetting these items were lower corporate and corporate technology expenses. Slide 15 provides our guidance 4Q 2022. We expect revenue in the range of $1.165 billion to $1.185 billion reflecting revenue down about 6.3% year-to-year at the midpoint of our guidance or down about 3.7% on a constant currency basis. 4Q 2022 EBITDA margins are expected to be about 31.5%. We're expecting adjusted EPS in 4Q 2022 to be $1.45 to $1.55 per share compared to 4Q 2021 adjusted EPS of $1.84 per share. As Mark shared earlier, the decline in our 4Q 2022 guidance is as compared to implied levels we shared in July, is driven by the significant reduction in our expectations for the U.S. mortgage market in the fourth quarter. 4Q 2022 revenue and our current guidance relative to our implied view in July is down about $25 million. Mark covered this earlier as the $45 million decline from the weakening U.S. mortgage market and $15 million decline driven by FX or partially offset by revenue from the acquisitions of LawLogix and Midigator and stronger non-mortgage revenue growth. 4Q 2022 adjusted EPS and our current guidance relative to our implied view in July is down about $0.21 per share or about $33 million in pre-tax income. This decline is driven by the impact of the decline in the U.S. mortgage market on revenue of $45 million, which given high variable margins drives a pre-tax income decline that exceeds the total variance level. Strong core revenue growth, both from the acquisitions of LawLogix and Midigator as well as stronger organic growth are delivering improvements in pre-tax income. However, these improvements are being offset, by the higher marketing sales and G&A expense that we referenced earlier and higher interest in other expenses. Reflecting the above, our expectations for the BUs [ph] in the fourth quarter as follows. EWS revenue is expected to have an about 3% or greater decline. Continued strong non-mortgage organic revenue growth is expected to offset the bulk of the impact on EWS mortgage revenue of the expected over 60% decline in mortgage originations. EWS EBITDA margins are expected to be about 48.5% in the quarter. USIS revenue is expected to have an about 7.5% or greater decline reflecting the greater than 50% assumed decline in the U.S. mortgage credit inquiries. B2B non-mortgage revenue growth is expected to improve from the levels we saw in the third quarter and B2B online continuing with high single digit growth. USIS EBITDA margins are expected to approach 36%. International continues to deliver a strong year and is expected to deliver constant currency revenue growth of up to 8.5% down from the third quarter as we lap growth from our UK debt management business. International EBITDA margins are expected to be up sequentially approaching 29%. The declines in both revenue and adjusted EPS and in 4Q 2022 year-to-year are also principally driven by the significant decline in the U.S. mortgage market and the significant impact of FX. Looking at revenue at the midpoint of our guidance of $1.175 billion, revenue is down about $78 million. FX is negative about $35 million or 2.6% year-to-year. So on a constant currency basis, revenue is down about $43 million. The impact of the decline in the U.S. mortgage market using originations declines for EWS and credit inquiries declines for USIS is negative about $185 million or almost 15 points. Excluding these factors effectively, constant dollar revenue growth excluding the impact of the U.S. mortgage market revenues up over $140 million, reflecting predominantly the very strong non-mortgage growth principally in EWS and international and also in the U.S. B2B online, and strong outperformance in mortgage relative to the overall market predominantly in EWS. Looking at adjusted EPS at the midpoint of our guidance of $1.50 adjusted EPS is down about $0.34 a share below operating income items, principally higher interest expense and the loss of equity income from our Russia JV, as well as the impact of FX explained just over half of the decline in adjusted EPS. The remainder of the decline is principally driven by the reduction in constant currency revenue of about $43 million. Slide 16 provides the specifics on our 2022 full year guidance. We expect revenue of approximately $5.1 billion and adjusted EPS is expected to be $7.49 to $7.59 per share. For the full year of 2022 we expect capital expenditures to be over $550 million. Capital expenditures are above the levels we expected in July as we maintained capital spending at first half 20 22 levels in the third quarter to continue the pace of migration of major exchanges to our cloud infrastructure. We expect to bring down capital spending in 2023 consistent with the completion of the migration of the major North American exchanges. We believe both our fourth quarter and full year guidance is centered at the midpoint of the revenue and adjusted EPS ranges we provide. As you consider the first quarter of 2023 we wanted to provide some general perspective on our current thinking on the U.S. mortgage market for the quarter. Using our current view of mortgage credit inquiries in the fourth quarter as a base, we currently expect mortgage credit inquiries to be down about 50% year-to-year in the first quarter of 2023. As we move through 2023, the year-to-year compares get substantially easier, particularly in the second half. Now I'd like to turn it back over to Mark. Mark Begor : Thanks, John. Turning to Slide 17, we have some very unique macros in our industry and EFX growth levers driving our performance in 2023 and beyond. The acceleration of the digital macro across every industry is expanding the use of identity, data signals and solutions to drive better decisions across new and existing verticals. Equifax is well positioned to take advantage of the accelerating digital macro through our EFX Cloud investments and our recent acquisitions of Insights, Kount and Midigator. Although we've been impacted by the significant declines in U.S. mortgage market, we believe we have unique levers at Equifax to deliver strong future growth, including Workforce Solutions above market growth and margins, and our expanded focus on new data assets like Insights, USIS non-mortgage growth and Kount and Midigator identity and fraud growth, our new EFX Cloud driving competitive, NPIs top line, and of course cost savings in 2023 and beyond. NPI is leveraging the EFX Cloud and our expanded resources and focus on new products and bolt-on M&A to broaden and strengthen Equifax. These attractive market macros along with the broad EFX growth levers and our strong core and non-mortgage outperformance in the past few years, gives us confidence in our ability to deliver above market growth in the future. In the event we do see further economic weakness driven by slowing consumer demand, we believe Equifax is well positioned for continued growth. As we shared with you in July, turning to Slide 18, the new Equifax is a much different and more diverse business than we were in the last recession. We are more resilient and better positioned for stronger revenue and earnings growth in challenging economic environments. During the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, Equifax performed very well and exhibited the resiliency you would expect from data analytics businesses. In 2009, we saw only a 6% decline in total revenue. Importantly, EWS grew throughout the global financial crisis and showed substantial growth of 17% in 2009. We believe that Equifax business mix today is much better positioned for a potential economic event than in 2009. First, strong EWS growth has increased their relative size in Equifax from 16% of revenue in 2009 to almost 50% today with margins over 50% and over 15 percentage points higher than the Equifax average. EWS is benefiting from strong growth levers that are not directly tied to economic activity, including record growth, penetration in new and fast growing verticals like talent and government, system-to-system integrations, deploying new higher value products, as well as measured price actions taking advantage of the scale of the TWN database. Second, completion of the Equifax Cloud will deliver cost savings in 2023 and beyond that we expect will drive about half of our targeted 500 basis point margin expansion from 2022 to 2025. The cloud migration cost savings are independent of any economic event and driven solely by our execution. And then last, we're leveraging the new Equifax cloud to accelerate new product rollouts with a goal of 13% Vitality in 2022, which is over $650 million of the annual incremental revenue from Equifax. As a reminder, NPIs rolled out in 2021 and 2022, will drive top line growth in 2023 and beyond as they mature in the marketplace. Today we believe about 54% of our global business is recession resilient or countercyclical and will grow in a recession. This is a big change and a strong position compared to Equifax and the 2008-2009 global financial crisis where only about 37% of our businesses were either recession resilient or countercyclical. The meaningful revenue growth in Workforce Solutions, U.S. mortgage and identity and fraud since 2009, as well as cloud transformation cost savings position Equifax very well if there's an economic event or recession in 2023 and beyond. Wrapping up on Slide 19, Equifax delivered another strong and broad based quarter driven by 13% organic and 20% total non-mortgage, constant dollar growth that more than offset the 41% decline in the mortgage market, reflecting the broad based strength of Equifax in this challenging economic environment. This is our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit core growth and our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit non-mortgage growth. Against the declining mortgage market, Equifax is resilient and investing for future growth. Against the unprecedented 37% mortgage market decline in 2022, we expect to deliver constant currency revenue growth of over 5% due to the breadth and strength of our underlying businesses. More importantly, our core revenue growth of 17% and non-mortgage constant currency growth of 20% are both well above our 8% to 12% long-term framework and reflect the strength of the underlying Equifax business model. This strong momentum positions us well in 2023 and beyond. EWS continues to deliver above market growth and is our largest, fastest growing and highest margin business. Workforce Solutions above market revenue growth over the past three years is powering Equifax growth as they approach 50% of our revenue. And new products leveraging the new Equifax Cloud are also driving growth. Our 13% Vitality from NPIs in 2022 will drive growth in 2023 and beyond. And we're in the early days of leveraging the new Equifax Cloud to drive innovation new products and expect to deliver strong Vitality in the future. Our 12 bolt-on acquisitions since January 2021 have expanded our capabilities and are delivering strong top line growth and will deliver synergies in 2023 and beyond. And then lastly, we're in the final chapters of completing our new Equifax Cloud data and technology transformation that will deliver top rank growth and cost benefits in 2023 and beyond as we complete the cloud and leverage our new cloud capabilities in single data fabric. Even in this uncertain economic environment, Equifax continues to be on offense and reinvesting in the new Equifax Cloud, new products, data and analytics and bolt-on M&A to drive future growth. We continue to be confident in our long-term growth framework of 8% to 12% total revenue growth and 7% to 10% organic revenue growth with ongoing expansion of margins of 50 basis points per year. We also remain focused on delivering on our 2025 goal of $7 billion in revenue and 39% EBITDA margins that we set at our Investor Day a year ago. Our ability to deliver non-mortgage growth of 20% in 2022 that is well above our long-term growth framework gives us confidence in the future. We remain energized about our performance in 2022 in a challenging mortgage macro and even more energized about the future of the new Equifax, a faster growing higher margin cloud native data analytics company. And with that operator, let me open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions. Manav Patnaik : Thank you. Mark, I was hoping just on Slide 17 where you gave us some of kind of the levers for 2023, I think, I was hoping you would touch on some of the macro trends you're seeing in the card and auto verticals. You know, just some perspective on where we are today in those categories relative to pre-COVID or history and some of the trends you're seeing there, whether they're decelerating or staying the same or any color around those would be helpful. Mark Begor : Yes, we talked a bunch Manav, good morning, about mortgage. So we're happy to talk more questions on that. You know, maybe if you step back kind of where we are with the consumer and our customers, the consumer continues to be exceptionally strong. Their credit scores are still up from 2019. They're working. We haven't seen real changes in delinquencies except at the subprime level there's some small changes, but even there delinquencies are lower than they were in 2019. So you've got consumers that have had wage growth. Employment is low, you know, so it's a very good environment for the consumer, which really impacts the verticals you talked about. And then our customers are still very strong there's no question about that. You know, when you think about the last economic event we had in the global financial crisis, you had both traditional financial institutions, banks, and fintechs that really had balance sheet problems. So that's not the environment we have today. So, it's similar to our dialogue that we had in July and back in April. We see a strong consumer continuing, through the fourth quarter and into 2023 and the same thing with our customers. So with regards to kind of activity around originations in some of those verticals not a lot of change. There's still some challenges in auto around supply chain, availability. I think there's expectations that's going to get better in the coming quarters, but it's still hard to find a car, particularly and certain models that you want to get, which is resulting in auto being down some from a year ago. But again, kind of at our expectation, no real change in cards. I think we mentioned in our comments that we've seen a little bit of weakening in some marketing, but I wouldn't call that a trend. You know, broadly, our customers are still focused on originations, card volume is very, very strong, card originations is very, very strong. And again, you go back to, you've got consumers that are very strong. I think everyone, you know, is watching very closely, both us and our customers. When will there be a change in delinquencies. G Capital : Manav Patnaik : Got it. John Gamble : If you just look at non-mortgage online organic growth rates in the third quarter, right? We saw telco was up double-digit, fi, insurance and auto were up mid-to-high single digits. So which is ______. Manav Patnaik : Got it. And then just on the Workforce Solutions two thirds of non-farm payroll data now in your database, it sounds like you've, I think been closing that gap maybe faster than we had expected. Just some thoughts if that, if it is the same case versus your internal expectations, but the question is, you know, how much of that is really, you know, locked in exclusive per se? Like, you know, just so that competition is in the one year. John Gamble : Yes, I think Manav a couple of points on that. You know, we're increasingly looking beyond non-farm payroll as you know. Adding in the gig economy as well as the pensioners, and when we think about our 146 million records and 111 million uniques or individuals in our data set, you know, there's about 200 plus million, 210 million, 220 million total working Americans and pensioners. So there's a long runway for us between w-2. Traditional employees, self-employed and remember self-employed we think about gig workers of being Uber drivers, DoorDash, et cetera. But think about self-employed doctors, self-employed lawyers, self-employed accountants self-employed contractors, it's a large population and then that pension base is quite large. And we mentioned in comments earlier that we've been starting to add pension records and gig records, and we signed an agreement with a company that does pension payroll, if you will, for various companies where we're going to do the income and employment verification for them. So, you know, we have the ability to double our data set, you know, over a lot of years going forward. And I think, as you know, we've talked to you before that, we've got a 13% to 15% long-term growth rate for Workforce Solutions that sits inside of Equifax's 8% to 12% growth rate. And we've got 3 to 4 points of that from record growth in the 13% to 15%. So, there's no question we've had above expectation record growth over the last, it's not new, it wasn't last quarter. You know, it's really been for three or four years. A lot of that has been from many of the payroll processors that you go back three or four years ago, we're not contributing our records and now they are. And as well as continued growth from our core records, which are from individual companies. So with regards to the competitive position we have, we feel very good about it. You know, the agreements that we've signed or on an exclusive basis since in 2022 and since I've been here, it's the right relationship between our partners and Equifax. They want it and we want it. And you know, when we think about half of our records coming from individual companies, those are from long-term relationships where we're providing those broad suite of services. Whether it's I-9, W2 management, unemployment claims, work opportunity tax credit, HCA benefits, all those solutions, to companies. We also do income and employment verification for them as a part of that relationship for free. So that's a very sticky relationship from our perspective. And you probably heard in my comments earlier that Workforce Solutions is really doing a much better job going to market with the full suite of employer solutions we have and we signed a contract with a large multinational, that's going to -- once it's implemented, it will be $20 million a year of Equifax revenue where we're providing all those employer solutions services to that multinational. Of course, we're also doing their income and employment verification. So we're quite energized about our progress of adding new records to the data set. I think as you point out, it's certainly been above the long-term framework. And broadly it's been quite positive for us. And maybe a last point that you're well aware of, as you know, the day we add the records, we're already able to monetize them because we're getting inquiries from our customers either through system-to-system integrations or through their access to our website for all of their applicants. So the day we add another record, it's monetized either in a mortgage application, a credit card application, a personal loan, an auto loan in a background screen or in a government social services. So we've got various verticals that are looking for more records. And we already have them in our order book. We just can't fulfill them until we grow the data set. So it's a very powerful growth lever for Workforce Solutions. Manav Patnaik : Got it, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks for taking my questions. One of the questions we are getting is more around if we use the fourth quarter EPS and analyze that it implies for next year a significant decline in earnings. I understand there are some puts and takes here. Obviously there was a discussion around cloud benefits coming in 2023, but I was wondering if you could help us parse what are some of the headwinds puts in the quarter, which may not exist going into 2023, and what are other tailwinds as we think about 2023? Thanks. Mark Begor : Yes, I'll start and then John can jump in. Obviously you want to start with revenue, you know you know, we, we expect to have you know, attractive non-mortgage growth next year. We're clearly going to have John talked about it, a grow over challenge in the first half of next year, meaning that the mortgage market will be down versus first quarter and second quarter of 2022 based on where current trends look. We don't have an outlook yet, but there was a strong mortgage market in the first quarter and it started declining in the second and more rapidly in the third. So, that's clearly going to be a part of our outlook going forward. You know, you also have our new product rollouts will be a positive for us. You know, that vitality index being above 10%, gives us momentum next year to drive the top line with those new solutions. And as I commented earlier, the new products we're rolling out this year, the 80 products we've rolled out so far, most of those aren't really in the revenue in a meaningful way in 2022. They really mature in 23 and in 2024. Last point I would make is that, we've made a number of acquisitions in the last 25 months or 20 months actually. And those acquisitions are obviously in our run rate revenue, but the synergies that we expect to get typically kick in years two and three, so meaning in 2022 and 2023. So meaning in 2023 we're going to get benefits from acquisition growth that we have going forward. John, maybe you add to that and maybe talk a little bit about some of the margin stuff? John Gamble : Absolutely. And so as Mark already really covered, right? So non-mortgage revenue growth, both from NPI but also from new product and also very importantly from pricing right, will absolutely benefit us as we go into next year. Generally speaking, I think most people know a lot of new products and mortgage and other verticals that we serve actually tend to get launched at year end and pricing actions tend to happen at year end. So we tend to get a nice benefit as you move from fourth quarter to first quarter every year, and it's done very consistently. We also expect to have, as Mark mentioned, improved cost position. As we move, move into next year, as we continue to migrate more and more of our major systems to the cloud, we start to be able to decommission more systems and we're starting to see savings as we move through 2023. That's certainly a benefit. Some of the marketing and sales incremental costs we talked about this quarter that would affect the next quarter are really driven by the fact that we're performing so very strongly this year, right? That we're paying compensation appropriately at very high levels into those organizations because they're substantially outperforming. Obviously, when you get into a new plan year, those things are all reset. So we think there's certainly cost opportunities that will help margin, but also for us with the fact that we're driving very strong non-mortgage growth with new product and pricing and obviously that flows through at extremely high margins is real benefit to us as we go into next year. So again, we're not providing guidance yet as we didn't in this call, but we have a lot of levers that can help strengthen 2023. Mark Begor : Maybe the last one, maybe just a last one is that we commented that there's some unusuals or things that are going to work out in Workforce Solutions margins in the third and fourth quarter, from the mix of mortgage and some additional costs associated with our sales and marketing that we made the comment that we clearly expect Workforce to be back at 50% plus margins in 2023, which will be obviously a positive too. Ashish Sabadra : Very helpful color. And maybe just a quick followup on EWS, the expectation for revenues to be down 3%, it's a significant moderation from 9% growth. Obviously mortgages ahead went there and maybe some of the acquisitions are anniversaring, but I was wondering if you could help parse what should -- how we should think about organic Verifier non-mortgage growth as we head into fourth quarter and next year? Thanks. Mark Begor : Sure. So I think we talked about it. We talked about organic revenue growth for EWS, and we said it was about 20%. Negatively impacting that is almost 15 points from reductions in UC & ERC. So if you exclude UC & ERC we're seeing organic growth across Workforce Solutions of approaching 35%, which we think is very\u2026 John Gamble : It's a very good number. Mark Begor : Very strong in the third quarter, right? So\u2026 John Gamble : Well above their 13% to 15% long-term growth rate. Mark Begor : And so even, and as we look into next quarter when we compare the 20% that they delivered this quarter, we expect to have very strong performance again next quarter also in non-mortgage. So again, we think EWS non-mortgage revenue growth has been really outstanding and continues to grow. Ashish Sabadra : Thank you. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions. Andrew Steinerman : Hi, John. I just want to verify that we have some figures here, and just for these questions, if it's okay, let's put aside core, when I ask these mortgage questions. So I think we know mortgage as a percentage of total third quarter revenues, I think that's 22% the inverse of the 78% on the first quarter, just please verify that? And the second thing I want to make sure that we have non-mortgage organic revenue growth and I think that's 13%. I think that's what you gave on Slide 4. And if you could just make a comment about fourth quarter, what's implied in terms of non-mortgage organic revenue growth. John Gamble : Yes, so I believe both of the numbers you quoted were in the presentation, so yes, I think they're correct. And in terms of non-mortgage growth right, we are expecting non-mortgage growth to continue to be strong, right? Mark talked about the fact that for the full year, we're continuing to expect 20% and we're expecting a strong fourth quarter, not quite probably as strong as the third quarter, so slightly, so somewhat below the third quarter, but still a very strong number and we're expecting to see that the strength that you've been seeing all year continue. Andrew Steinerman : Okay, thank you, John. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is come from the line is Kyle Peterson with Needham and Company. Please proceed with your questions. Kyle Peterson : Hey good morning guys. Just wanted to follow up on the margin a little bit, maybe if you guys could run us through some of the puts and takes in the 4Q step down is really most or all of that just mortgage and lower volumes kind of running through and the full quarters impact of that or there's no, like other cost inflation or anything that you guys are seeing material in your business? Mark Begor : No cost, really inflationary impact. It's really the mix of the loss of that mortgage revenue is just such high margin. And then I think we also talked about some costs from sales and marketing and onboarding, some TWN contributors, but the majority of it is the margin mix from a mortgage. John Gamble : Absolutely. The step down in 4Q from 3Q is really driven by lower revenue in general because of, but it's driven by lower -- because mortgage is lower, and obviously mortgage has a very high variable margin. So that's the driver. Kyle Peterson : Got it. That's helpful. And then, just a quick follow up on international, obviously the constant currency trends have looked really good for you guys. I know FX is kind of a problem for you guys and a lot of companies, but a little surprising to us that, I guess with all the recessionary fears and such, are you guys seeing any slow down or caution especially in parts of Europe and such with your clients or has at least through October so far have those trends still held up and been pretty stable and healthy? Mark Begor : Yes, as you know Europe for us is primarily UK but also Spain is where we participate. And while inflation is a challenge, they're still working, right? And so we really haven't seen any meaningful change in what's happening with our customers. Everyone is worried about inflation, but when you've got people working, they're generally going to pay their bills, they are also going to spend money and they operate. And as you saw from our comments, our UK business, which is most of Europe, had a very good quarter. I think it was up 7%. So no, we haven't seen it yet, even with all the inflation fears. Kyle Peterson : Got it. It's helpful. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is come from the line of Kelsey Zook [ph] with Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your questions. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, Mark. Hey John. For EWS for this quarter, when I look at non-mortgage Verifier revenue, it seems to be down a little bit sequentially. Can you just help us understand a little bit in terms of what's going on there? Is it the consumer lining keys? Is it talent or government or other verticals? John Gamble : Yes, so EWS non-mortgage in Verifier, but broadly right, was very strong, right? So again, the growth rates we're talking about are extremely high. We think government and talent continue to perform very, very well. What we -- if you're just looking at growth rates, obviously as you move through the year, comps get tougher because we grew very strongly in 2021. But overall, as we take a look at talent solutions, I think we grade the growth rates. Yes, they're slightly, they're slightly lower, but it also driven by comps, government very strong. I think we saw very good performance in kind of commercial in the non-mortgage finance segment, which again, was very strong. So we feel very good about the trajectory and the trend and continuing very strong non-mortgage growth rates there. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. And just a quick follow up on EWS margin with the current mortgage environment. I'm trying to figure out what's sort of like a new normal for EWS margins? Should we basically be thinking about that as in line with what we've seen this quarter or even Q4, so kind of in the 49% range? Mark Begor : No, I said, we said in our comments, and hopefully you heard it, that we clearly expect margins at EWS to return to that 50% plus level in 2023. We view this mortgage mix as being a challenge in the third and fourth quarter. That will definitely impact their margins as well as some of the additional costs in sales and marketing and TWN contributor onboarding in the third and fourth quarter. I think we talked about 9 or is it 9 or 10 additions of new contributors, that 10 additions of new payroll processors that are adding records. There's generally some incremental costs, when those get added. And our non-mortgage growth is so high; we're having some additional sales and marketing costs in EWS. But to be clear we expect EWS margins over the long-term to be at that 50% plus rate versus where they are at this quarter and next quarter. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks. Very helpful. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your questions. Andrew Jeffrey : Hi good morning. I appreciate all the detail and color as usual guys. John, just a question for you on overall consolidated EBITDA margin progress, I think you touched on some of the potential tailwinds next year, but given the challenges, especially early in the year with mortgage, and thinking about margins being flattish maybe up a little, and that's my number, not yours, and then a bit of an improvement in 2024, it just seems like a heavy lift to get to 39% by 2025. Is there a step function that we need to be thinking about? I'm just trying to understand that? Mark Begor : John, you should jump in. But remember, a big piece of that path to 39 is the cloud transformation completion. And we get some meaningful impact on cost takeout, and we telegraph before and every quarter we talk about it that roughly half of that lift from our margins last year to the 39 is from cloud execution. And that's in our hands, so we know how to do it. It's not economic related. We're going to, whether the economy's up, down or sideways, we're going to complete the cloud and that plugs in. You've got Workforce Solutions growing faster than the rest of Equifax, at their 50% plus EBITDA margins, that equates in margin between now and 2025. You've also got our new product rollouts, our non-mortgage growth that we expect to deliver is also going to deliver margin expansion over that timeframe. John Gamble : Yes. But as we get to 2025 and the framework even we laid out last November, right? We indicated we expect the markets that we're in to be somewhat normal. So we were expecting kind of a normal non-mortgage market, and we're expecting the mortgage market itself to move back toward more normal levels, right? So a big part of in addition to the cost takeout related to tech transformation, which Mark already referenced, a big part of the mortgage increase is related to that revenue growth. And clearly we do need, in order to deliver those levels, we do need to see some recovery in the mortgage market and moving, having it move back toward more normal, and then obviously some normal non-mortgage markets. And given the fact that we're performing so well in non-mortgage growth, it gives us comfort that we have a path there to that $7 billion. But we do need to see some recovery in some of the markets we're serving, particularly mortgage. Andrew Jeffrey : Okay. Now I get that. That's helpful, thank you. And then Mark, your comments in USIS about mortgage shopping being a tailwind, I appreciate that. I just wonder as rates really have blown out here in the 10 years yield is up again today, remarkably how long can that persist? Does there just come a point where rates and accordingly housing affordability reaches a level where you're just not going to see that kind of behavior? And is that something you're contemplating as you think about the ultimate 2023 guidance you offer us? Mark Begor : It's not, it's just, our view is, and what we've seen and we continue to see it, is that at these higher rates consumers just spend more time shopping around and when they do that shopping USIS benefits from that credit poll that happens in the shopping process and we do not expect that to change. I think your question maybe is a little bit different around, at these high rates, are people going to still buy houses, and at these high rates are people still going to do some level of refis? Which there's some, it's obviously down a bunch, but it\u2019s more cash out refis to access, the multi-trillion dollars of untapped home equity in the U.S. And as the mortgage market doesn't disappear. It certainly declined further and more rapidly than, we've expected. As you know, we've been -- revised our mortgage guidance three times this year because we didn't, we couldn't forecast where the Fed was going to take these rates, and I don't think anybody can except higher from where they are now. We're actually getting better at forecasting out a couple of months, meaning inside the quarter. But as you get out, past a quarter looking out with what's happening with the volatility of where rates are going, it's more challenging. So we'll certainly take all of these factors in place when we put out our 2023 guide in February and you'll have a clearer view hopefully there on what the mortgage market is going to look like. But there's no question, the mortgage market is going to bottom at some point. And it doesn't go obviously to zero. There's going to be an area where people still move, and even at this interest rates and it's happened before in the U.S., people still buy homes. So and meaning they buy homes and get mortgages. So there's that level of floor, I think we're all struggling with where it is. And, we'll have a better view, in a few months of what that looks like for 2023. And as John talked earlier, first and second quarter we're going to have tougher comps against a very strong mortgage market in first quarter this year. But as we get to third and fourth, we'll start, comping more towards what should be a floor until we get past whatever economic event we're in here. Andrew Jeffrey : I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Thanks so much. Hey, obviously lot of uncertainty on mortgage, but with the inquiry guidance in Q1, is there any way to think about what percentage of revenue mortgage could be in the first quarter, and then any way to think about how you think that will progress over the course of 2023, just as a percentage of revenue more broadly? Mark Begor : Yes, I think as Kevin, as we talked a few minutes ago with Andrew, we're in, that we're not doing any guidance on anything on 2023 right now. We're focused on the fourth quarter. And we'll certainly give that guidance as, when we get to likely our February fourth quarter earnings discussion. Kevin McVeigh : Okay. And then Mark, you talked within EWS obviously kind of the relative outperformance is kind of record penetration system, the systems direct integration pricing. Is there any way to ring fence the contribution across each one of those? Like is it primarily the records growth that drives it, or just so we get a sense of across those five buckets, or is it kind of evenly distributed? Mark Begor : Yes, I wouldn't say even, but they're all important. There's not one that's disproportionate. Look, record additions are very attractive and very unique for the Workforce Solutions business because it drives revenue day two, after you add the records and as you, 16% record growth in the quarter, and we've driven records up double-digit for the last number of years, that's a certainly a positive. We take prices up every year, so that's something we'll do in January with all the verticals in Workforce and across Equifax. New products, we talked about Workforce Solutions is indexing kind of north of our 14% in a quarter and our 13% guide for the year of new product introductions. That's very attractive for workforce and we've talked in prior meetings about continuing to drive system-to-system integrations, and penetration is a big opportunity in Workforce. If you think about the credit file, it's very highly penetrated in all financial services verticals. Workforce is not even in mortgage. There's still 40 odd percent of mortgages that we don't see that are still done with paper pay stubs. We only do roughly one in 10, roughly background screens. In government you've got a $2 billion TAM and we've got a $300 million roughly business there. So there's a lot of government penetration opportunity. So you can see each of them are attractive and very valuable, which is why we have a lot of confidence in Workforce Solutions 13% to 15% long-term growth rate. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Hey, Mark can you talk a little bit about the NPIs and whether there's been any kind of change strategically about how you approach that we're seeing is, much higher NPI like 14%, but we're seeing the numbers of new products, obviously much lower than we saw last year. Is there some kind of strategy that you have in terms of less shots on goal, but more higher percentage shots of goal? Or just, is that just very year-per-year and we really can't look that much into the numbers of NPI like we used to? Mark Begor : No, numbers are important, obviously. I think just maybe spooling back to kind of two years ago when we really ramped up our new product resourcing. We brought in a cheap product to officer, we've got more of a cadence around it. We did that intentionally in advance of our single data fabric and in advance of our cloud capabilities because we were convinced that the cloud, which again, we still have to complete, we're well down the road and a single data fabric will allow us to bring things to market we couldn't do before. And use the example of the product we rolled out this week at the Mortgage Bankers Association of taking our telco utility cell phone data and embedding it in the credit file. That's a very sophisticated product. It's going to drive higher hit rates, higher approval rates, higher originations for our customers. And it's something that only Equifax can deliver. So that multi-data solution is a big part of our new product capabilities. The second area is really leaning more into our trended data, our historical data workforce solutions now gets what, 40% of revenue from historical records, almost 50 now. So you think about how they've changed that in the last couple of years through their new product capabilities. And think about a mortgage solution that shows historical income data on a consumer back a year, two years, three years, four years. That helps in the underwriting process. We sell that at a higher price point. Think about in the talent vertical, a history of job employment that's required. As, we have 500 million and I think 560 million total records now in the TWN database and that's, well over five and a half jobs on the average American, so that multi data as well as historical solution. I think the other thing that's quite encouraging, I mentioned in my comments earlier is that, workforce solutions that's further down in the, the road in the cloud is delivering well north of the 14% vitality. They're one of the big drivers of that guide up for the year on new products. And that's what we wanted to see. That's what we expected to see. And I think the good news is we're seeing it, meaning as we get further into the cloud, we're able to deliver those new solutions to our customers. And I think, as you know new products are also very high. Obviously they drive incremental revenue growth, but they're very high incremental margins. You're thinking 70%, 80% kind of incremental margins on new products. It's why we're driving the initiative, but it also makes us more valuable to our customers. We're bringing them solutions that helps them solve problems and either drive their top line, their bottom line or both in a very positive way. So it's a big focus of ours and, it's going to, it's one that's central to our long-term growth strategy. And you remember back in November in our Investor Day, we talked a bunch about that being one of the factors of increasing our long-term growth rate to the 8% to 12 was our expectation. And now you're seeing it of our ability to deliver that 10% Vitality in our long-term growth rate. John Gamble : And just to clarification, the almost 50% I quoted is a verifier revenue. Mark Begor : Yes. From a historical Shlomo Rosenbaum : Just to clarify then, I understand it's important. What I'm just trying to understand is the difference between the 14% and the amount of record of NPI that's coming in, that that's kind of the block -- I\u2019m used to get it. Mark Begor : Sure. You use the term shots on goal, or do you want to have more shots that go in or more shots on goal and, we want both, right? So you have a bell curve with any new product portfolio you put in place, you're going to have, some products that are, screaming winners, that really hit the mark with our customers and some that are less successful. And then there's also maturity cycle to them, as I mentioned, we'll roll out products in the second half of this year that, won't deliver any revenue in 2022 but they'll start maturing in 2023, 2024, 2025 that's really what you have from a cycle standpoint. So to answer your specific question, we're looking to have more and obviously having more that deliver rajthat deliver larger revenue, and I think we're just getting better at that. Primarily because we're really being quite deliberate around collaborating with our customers. Instead of creating a product we think the market wants, we're creating a product that we know a customer wants because we're collaborating with them. And then once it works with one customer or two, then we productize it to take it out to the rest of our customer base. Shlomo Rosenbaum : ARDSO: John Gamble : No, so the conversion you're talking about, so part of, as part of transformation as you said removing financial systems to the cloud as well, and the major movement of financial systems, including billing systems, actually runs through October, right? Little bit in November. So some of the level of elevated DSOs we saw in the second quarter did continue into the third quarter. It's related to those transac to that system migration. And we expect to see substantial improvement as we move through the fourth quarter. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Craig Huber : Yes. Hi, good morning. My first question, did your Appriss acquisition, can you maybe just tell us how the integration has been going here in the last year and I'd be curious what the pro forma organic year-over-year revenue growth was in the third quarter for the acquisition and what was it maybe for the 12-month period too? Do you have that? Mark Begor : Yes, so the Appriss Insights acquisition, as is our incarceration data business. We're really pleased. We bought it really just a year ago, so it's 12 months in. And the integration's progressing very positively. We talked about, some of the joint solutions that we're already bringing to market, putting their data into our total verified data hub. And we've got new products, in the pipeline, both on enhancing their solutions with their data, but also combining their data with some of the other data that's used either in the talent or in the government verticals to deliver a single pole with either employment data plus the incarceration data or employment education and incarceration. So we've seen really positive opportunities there. And as far as growth rates, it was growing, kind of mid teams when we bought it, and it still is, we're very pleased with the growth of the business. Craig Huber : Okay, great. My other question is, you've talked on this call in prior ones at the health of the U.S. consumer being quite strong versus pre-pandemic 2019 levels. I'm curious, are you saying that you, with all the data you look at that it's not materially getting worse versus three and six months ago, the U.S. consumer? Mark Begor : Absolutely not. No. There's still strong and there really hasn't been a change in 2022 about, around the consumer. As you know, employment has, unemployment has gone down and employment has gone up, you know, since the beginning of the year. So that's good for consumers. Wage growth is up, which is good for consumers, and that helps their balance sheet. Obviously, inflation's a bad guy, and it is hurting, lots of consumers. But even with inflation, consumers are still out there spending and traveling and doing all the things that they do in their lives. So the credit scores are up 15 points from 2019 that hasn't really changed. They're in good shape. You really have to watch employment and unemployment, that's where things generally change with a consumer. Obviously inflation is challenging particularly for, the kind of the lower income demographic, but the rest of the population is doing okay. Craig Huber : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Please proceed with your questions. Andrew Nicholas : Thanks. Good morning. In the international business, how much of the recent strength would you attribute to share gains versus end market strength at the country level? And to what extent would you say the cloud transformation is already paying dividends in terms of growth and Vitality Index there? Mark Begor : Yes so this, I would add a couple things to the list. I wouldn't call it, obviously end market in 2022 is stronger than 2021 as they, the international markets came out of the pandemic earlier this year. But the end markets aren't -- like in Latin America the end markets are always strong just because the underlying growth there. But I wouldn't say there's been a change in the end markets. Our team is executing well. So there is some commercial strength there. New products are a big deal, as far as bringing new solutions, new products to market. For example, we're bringing our count identity and fraud solutions to a lot of our international markets, so we're starting to get some traction there, which is helping our international platforms. Cloud isn't really a benefit to them yet. They're further behind the North America intentionally in cloud, with the exception of Canada. So their cloud benefits are really going to be more in 2023 and actually more in 2024 as they complete the cloud. What would you add to international John? John Gamble : Just in debt management? I mean, they're growing very fast, right? I don't know if you would call that share or not, right? But what it is, we have certain large customers that we have very high positions with that are growing very fast, right? And principally the UK Government, so that's driving a nice piece of growth obviously in UK. Andrew Nicholas : That's helpful. Thank you. And then for my followup John, maybe a question for you, just a quick clean up item. Corporate expenses tick down pretty significantly on a sequential basis. Could you speak to the driver there and how sustainable kind of that, that new level is? It's obviously ticked down quite a bit here, a couple quarters in a row. Just want to make sure I understand the dynamics driving that. Thank you. John Gamble : Yes. So if you're just doing sequential third versus second, right? The big drivers were corporate technology spend and also tech transformation spend. Some of that was just good cost management. Some of that is around tech transformation. And that can move between BUs in corporate and we saw some of that in the third quarter, as projects complete in corporate or teams move between Corp and the BUs, you can see expenses come down in corporate. We had a little bit of that in the third quarter. We also saw some good cost management and some sequential declines across corporate expenses in general. And we did see some lower expenses specifically related to compensation and variable compensation broadly because we took the year down. So I'd say those were the big drivers. I think we expect to be at lower levels of expense than last year substantially, right? And which you've seen all this year probably in the fourth quarter you're going to see some of those expenses tick back up again because we'd expect to see some more investment in technology and corporate technology. So some of the benefit we got in the third quarter we'll give back because we're spending up, we\u2019re spending more on transformation. So for example, Shlomo\u2019s question around financial system transformation, some of that's occurring in the fourth quarter. So hope that helps. Andrew Nicholas : It does. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. Please proceed with your questions. Jeff Meuler : Yes, thank you. Good morning. Mark, any additional perspective you can provide on what you're hearing from customers on the pre-screen and marketing activities starting to pull back, just given the health of the consumer at this point and bank balance sheet health. So we just love to kind of like square those two points. Mark Begor : Yes, as I said earlier, Jeff broadly the consumers unchanged from second quarter. And so our bank balance sheets are very strong. So there's no change there, so don't take, whatever you heard earlier is, some message around that. We're seeing big pullbacks. What I will tell you is every time I meet in the C-suite or with CROs we're all talking about, because we all watch CNBC, we all watch what's happening with inflation. We all see what's happening with interest rates of, when will it have an effect on consumers, and when will it have effect on ability to pay and delinquencies. And again, my view of someone who's been around financial services for, multi decades, it all starts with employment. And that's the indicator that we watch, I watch. And then after that is delinquencies. But we're seeing it still a strong job market. I think there's not quite two, but there is 1.7 jobs open for anyone who's out of a job now, something like that, so it's still very vibrant and, we don't see indications of what I would call pullback, but everyone's watching it. It's clearly a conversation in every meeting. Jeff Meuler : Got it. Appreciate the perspective. And then within TWN 16% records growth is great, as you said, way above the long term framework to drive a really good growth model. But growth accelerated year-over-year, the comp doesn't look tougher. Sequential growth seemed just okay, considering you're still onboarding partners and non-farm payrolls are growing. So any perspective on that figure and if you can confirm if there was any partner record attrition? Thanks. Mark Begor : Yes. There's some levels, it's very de-minimus of what I would call churn inside of the records, but they're obviously, they're generally growing when you're up 16%, so there's, it's not something that we see and there is, obviously a change, some changes in employment with some of our partners. As you go through the year, there's a seasonality as you might imagine, where there's hiring and some industries think about retail warehouse, related to the holiday season that we see in increased employment, which in results at increased records for us you know, call it in the second half of the year. And then a change in the first half of the year when some of that, comes some of that holiday hiring, comes out of the system. But broadly, we are seeing, obviously it's 16% strong record growth inside of the TWN set. John Gamble : I'd say it's generally true that we're seeing it's actually been a very good year, both in terms of signing new partners, but also direct contributors, right? So I think we, we feel like in terms of the execution of the team on building new contributors, it's really been an outstanding year. Jeff Meuler : Yep, got it. Thank you. Mark Begor : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your questions. David Togut : Thank you and good morning. Just bridging to some of the earlier questions on revenue, but focusing specifically on EWS, if we take your fourth quarter 2022 revenue growth guide of down at least 3% and kind of think through your commentary on Q1 mortgage credit inquiries being down, 50% or so year-over-year, how should we think about the starting point for EWS revenue in 2023? Mark Begor : Yes, again, we don't want to get into 2023 guidance. We gave you our fourth quarter guidance; it\u2019s too early to talk about 2023. And I think we talked about, obviously mortgage in for sure in the first half will be a challenge, because of the strong mortgage market in the first quarter last year. But we, in some of the previous questions, talked a bunch about, what are the positives if you will, having the non-mortgage total growth of 20 and organic growth of 13, that's momentum coming out of 2022 into 2023. That, is obviously going to be important to us. We talked about the fact we do pricing actions typically on 11 so that's going to be a positive, for us in 2023. The new products, we talked about the acquisition synergies and growth, going into 2023. What else would you add, John? John Gamble : Yes, we covered pretty good list in the earlier question. I think it's a pretty good list, right? So specific to EWS and specific to verifier, records growth was obviously outstanding so far this year. Mark Begor : Well, 16% records growth carries through till. John Gamble : Absolutely. Mark Begor : Next year and I think we talked about 10 new partners being signed up three in the quarter. Those won't go online in the fourth quarter. Those will be additions. That'll happen in 2023 that'll drive records. And of course we're out there, working to add more records that will help EWS. David Togut : Understood. Just as my follow up the 38% organic non-mortgage growth at Workforce Solutions and Q4 talent up 50% organic, government up 44% organic. How should we think about the runway for growth for both talent and government in 2023? Are these types of growth rates sustainable or have they peaked? Mark Begor : Yes, we're not giving growth rate, outlook for 2023. That's not the intention of this meeting yet. But when you think about those two verticals, I talked about it earlier. You think about talent as a $5 billion Tam where we have a ton of penetration opportunity, right? because we're only doing one in 10 or two in 10 background screens. So that's a opportunity there. And then in the government, very similar government that's about a $2 billion TAM for that kind of verification of income and employment in some cases. And we've got $300 million business. So there's a lot of growth potential there. And add on top of it, kind of the core workforce solutions, growth levers outside of penetration, of adding more records is going to drive hit rates in both businesses. Whether it's for background screening or government social services, you add in our new products pricing changes that we're going to do early in the year system, system integrations drive revenue for us in both of those verticals. So those are the kind of growth levers the team's going to work on. And is in flight on as well as the momentum that we have coming out of the year, which is quite strong. John Gamble : Over the longer term we have a 13% to 15% long term growth rate. So obviously the growth rates we're delivering today in those specific verticals are well above that. So we would expect over time, we're going to have very good performance in those verticals, but growth rates over time, we would expect in general and non-mortgage, are going to converge more down toward our long term model. David Togut : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line and Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions. Toni Kaplan : Thanks very much. Just looking ahead, how should we be thinking about your ability to pass on price increases in EWS versus prior years if we do have an economic slowdown, like does that impact pricing? Do you temper, what you're trying to push through? And just maybe if you could ground us on how we should be thinking about like a normal pricing baseline for EWS for price increase? Mark Begor : Yes, we don't see any real change in not only EWS, but across Equifax about what we're going to do in price in 2023. And like, it's already happening, so it's not going to, we're already in flight talking to customers about what our plans are around price for 2023, because most of the pricing goes into effect 11. Workforces, is a very unique solution that delivers, really unique value to our customers. So we have more pricing, power there or flexibility. But we're always balanced about, price, whether it's a, good or bad economic times. But I would say broadly, we don't think about pricing being different. If there's an economic event, and again, there's an economic event hasn't happened yet, the outside of the mortgage macro, the economy's quite good. Our non-mortgage business is very strong. Our customers are strong, the consumers are strong. So, we're kind of doing what we, I would characterize as kind of a normal process in January. Toni Kaplan : Great. And then you've talked for some time now about getting the gig and pensioner records. Have you been having success in getting those and is there a different process for, getting gig records versus W2 records? Are they harder to get? Because it's more maybe fragmented outside of ride sharing just what, how is the update on the process and how your success is and how different it is? Thanks. Mark Begor : Yes, there's still a bunch of runway in W2, which you heard and we're penetrating that which is, most of our records today are W2. So that 16% growth is primarily in that set, and there's still, another 40 million, 50 million records to get there. And then if you go to gig, it is more dispersed and we've got a number of strategies underway to go after those records, which are equally valuable. And we've got some traction around pensioner records. As I mentioned, we've signed a big partner to bring some records in. We're also getting records directly from large kind of legacy companies that do their own pension or payroll processing or pension or payment processing. So we're working on all those avenues and we've got dedicated teams on them and we're, our expectation is to continue to add records from all three areas, as we move through the fourth quarter and into 2023 and beyond. And what's energizing for us is the opportunity to still double the data set, it 111 million uniques and call it 210 million or thereabouts total employed or pension payment recipients in the United States. We got a long runway to add new records to the TWN data set. And again I mentioned this a couple times, I know it's not lost on you Toni, that we're already getting inquiries on those, right? So we get inquiries on the half of the records we don't have. So it's just a matter of adding them to drive our revenue growth. Toni Kaplan : Perfect. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Simon Clinch with Atlantic Equities. Please proceed with your questions. Simon Clinch : Hi. I just wonder if I could just go back to the verification services revenue and something I've been sort of tracking has been some non-mortgage revenues on a sort of per average record basis. And since the pandemic that's just been moving up steadily pretty much every quarter since, and it's ticked down for the first time. And I was wondering, is there anything in particular about, in terms of that kind of structural opportunity or a revenue per record basis going forward, if we, you, should it be capped out at any particular time or is there anything we should read into that? Mark Begor : Yes, no we've been growing revenue per record quite meaningfully again the way you should think about it and the way it's, the way we think about it is, as we get into new verticals, like talent and government, or even as I would characterize, cards and as a newer vertical autos under penetrated, all of those verticals as we add those new revenue sources, the records become more valuable, right? Because we're, monetizing that same record multiple times when someone applies for a mortgage and then a credit card and then an auto loan or a P loan, and then they apply for a new job, or then they have to get government social services. You've got multiple avenues to monetize that record. So it's part of the power of the business. John Gamble : The only thing I'd add, right, and the Simon right, is that the obviously the different verticals we have very different price points and very different product structures. So you can see mix changes in any give given period when you're taking a look at transactions and records and revenue. But, so just make sure you keep that in mind as you're running your analytics. Simon Clinch : I understood. Okay. Thank you. And just as a follow up we talked a lot about how the mortgage revenues declines are really impacting margins, very high incremental margin. I just wanted to just confirm again that should mortgages ever rebound, should we just assume that it carries that kind of 80% incremental margin on the way up as well? Is there any reason not to assume that? And then longer term is there any reason why the non-mortgage revenues shouldn't carry the same kind of incremental margins as the mortgage business does today? Mark Begor : So are you specifically talking about verifier? Simon Clinch : Yes. Sorry in verifier. Mark Begor : Okay. Yes, so variable margins with the contribution margins for mortgage obviously yes going in, coming out should be very similar. Whether or not we reinvest some of the incremental profit generated would be a different discussion, right? But they certainly should be similar in terms of the contribution margin of both. Generally speaking, the margins across Verifier are similar. They can be somewhat different depending on the relative price point and the volumes relative to the price point. So you can see some higher cost for different kind of to your earlier question. But broadly speaking yes, the margins for the products across verification services are relatively similar. Simon Clinch : Okay. It's just a question of reinvestment at 5G. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next questions come from the line of Seth Weber with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions. Seth Weber : Hi, good morning guys. Just I just wanted to ask about this sequential improvement in USIS EBITDA margin that you guys are forecasting for the fourth quarter. It looks like revenue is a kind of flattish sequentially. Is that just some of the sales and marketing expenses are going out or it doesn't seem like mix is really changing a lot, so just if there's any color on the 200 basis points of uptick 3Q to 4Q? John Gamble : Yes, so sequentially generally we see a little bit of an uptick. Certainly, we definitely see an uptick in non-mortgage revenue generally in USIS from the fourth quarter. So we'd expect to see some of that and it tends to draw very high variable margins, so and given that we expect to see a little more leverage on some of the OpEx. That's all. Seth Weber : Okay. I mean, I'm just trying to understand, over the last prior to the second quarter, the business was sort of high 30% margin. So I'm just trying to think through if there was any reason why you wouldn't get back to that level, relatively quickly next year. It sounds like you're moving back in that direction? Mark Begor : Relatively quickly, yes obviously the mortgage market decline is weighed on that. John Gamble : Very heavily. Right. So obviously as we get into 2023, we'll give you a better view as to what we expect 2023 USIS margins to do. Seth Weber : Right. Okay and then just quick clarification, you guys talked about a couple times, you referenced M&A synergies expected over the next couple years. Is that revenue synergies or expense synergies or both, or just how should we think about that? Mark Begor : Both yes when we do these bolt-on acquisitions, part of our strategy is to bring in, unique data assets that we can combine with other Equifax data assets in order to drive, new solutions to market. And that generally takes time. We got to integrate the business, integrate their data set into our single data fabric, and that usually takes call a year and change. And then we can start bringing those to market and then those drive the top line and the bottom line. Seth Weber : Got it. Okay, thank you guys. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions. Faiza Alwy : Yes. Hi, good morning. Thank you. I just, I wanted to talk about EWS margins again, and I'm curious, when you first gave the margins earlier this year, I think you talked about 54%. And just want to understand, is the deceleration from that to where we are today entirely mortgage related, or is there anything else in the underlying business that's \u2013 that has impacted that change? Mark Begor : Yes, the biggest driver and margin degradation by far is the impact on revenue and the very high variable margins we get for mortgage. So that's the biggest driver, right. We have talked about some increased expenses. We talked about some marketing investments and things we're making this year to drive NPI, which have been very successful. But generally overall the biggest driver in the movement is, has been related to the reduction in revenue related to mortgage. Faiza Alwy : Okay. Got it. And then just as we think about those margins, I appreciate, I know you're not providing 2023 guidance, but I appreciate you giving us a EWS margin outlook of about 50%. I'm curious if you can give us just not numbers, but just holistic thoughts around how we should think about the, I guess the quarterly cadence. I mean, I'm thinking we should build through the course of the year. Is there anything you can say about 1Q margin, which is given that you did provide an outlook for mortgage inquiries for the first quarter? Mark Begor : Yes. We're not ready to talk about 2023 guidance. We did want to make, clear that first quarter's going to have a tough comparison given the fourth quarter exit and the strength in the first quarter last year. And then at EWS you said about 50%, we actually said over 50%, just to be accurate. But yes, we'll be ready to give 2023 guidance, when we get into 2023. Faiza Alwy : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions. George Tong : Hi, thanks. Good morning. You mentioned that non-mortgage growth in 4Q will be strong, but not as strong as 3Q. Can you discuss data points that you're seeing in the bank card and auto lending sectors that suggest an incremental moderation in strength in those categories? Mark Begor : I don't know if you were listening, George, but we got that question from, earlier that we're not seeing any change the non-mortgage growth rates that we're talking about are very, very high. And we expect them to, still be very strong in the fourth quarter. John Gamble : And look, and we did give a view of international in the fourth quarter, international was outstanding in the third quarter, still going to be very strong in the fourth quarter, but its growth rate is somewhat lower and obviously international their revenue is virtually all non-mortgage. George Tong : Okay, Got it. As you look at the mortgage category certainly there was a significant amount of refinancing activity that was pulled forward into 2020 and 2021. To what extent does this pull forward structurally lower the medium term mortgage revenue growth outlook for Equifax? John Gamble : Obviously we're seeing the impacts of that right now, since refinances has dried up predominantly, Right. So what's left is just cash out refis, and we're actually now starting to see substantial growth in HELOC\u2019s, right, replacing even some of the cash out refis. So I think we're living through the, obviously the impact of that dramatic reduction in refinance right now. We gave a view of first quarter mortgage, but again in terms of giving a view as we go forward, which is kind of for us, 2023 would be midterm. It's just a little bit earlier, unfortunately you're just going to have to wait until we get into the first quarter and be for us to give our 2023 guidance. George Tong : Yes, well it really wasn't a 2023 question. More like a medium term, longer term questions since you've in the past, given longer term guidance targets before. Mark Begor : I don't know what you mean by medium term, longer term, do we expect the mortgage market over the long term to return to a more normal level? Absolutely. No question about it. Is that what you mean? George Tong : Well, medium term, so I guess over the next two to three years or two to four years Mark Begor : What's going to happen with the economy in the first year or two of that cycle? And then at the tail end that you said two to four, you get out to four years, it would, my expectation is you'd get back to a more normal level. But I don't know what's going to happen with the economy. I don't think you do either, George. George Tong : Got it, okay. Helpful, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Heather Balsky with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions. Heather Balsky : Hi, thank you for taking my question. I wanted to just clarify well, I want two questions. One, I wanted to clarify the benefit you see next year from the cloud transformation. You said half the 500 basis points, so is that a gross or net 250 basis point benefit flowing through? And also, does that include sort of rolling off some of the, the additional costs? Is that just savings or is that also rolling off the costs from the implementation? And then the other question totally separate, but just on the talent solution side, you talked about sort of the white space there, just sort of what can get you further penetrated in the background check industry? Thanks. John Gamble : So on transformation that would, the savings are related to all costs related to transformation, both the lower COGS as well as the lower investment levels. And then also they're going to be more backend loaded than front end loaded, right? Because the, you get the savings as all customers migrate, and you can actually decommission systems. So we'll start getting savings in 2023, as we said, and we feel good that's just going to happen. But the bigger savings happen is you get into 2024 and 2025. So you should think about that type of a cadence. What was your second question again, Heather? Sorry. Heather Balsky : Just on the cloud transformation the 250 basis points, is that the flow through this year or into next year? Mark Begor : No, I think, as John said and we've said consistently, not only in this call and prior calls, the 250 is really between 2022 and 2025, and it's that path, the 39% EBITDA margins in 2025. That's our goal. That happens over 2023, 2024 and 2025, that's not a 2023 change. John Gamble : And I think, and more of that would be backend loaded, as I just said, right? Because it happens as systems actually decommission. So we'll see some in 2023 yes, but you're just going to see more of it in 2024 and 2025. Heather Balsky : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions. Surinder Thind : Good morning. I'd like to start a question regarding your long term framework. Can you maybe talk about, is that intended to be like a rolling three year measurement period or like a five year period? And then maybe when we think about something like EWS non-mortgage, which continues to grow well above that framework, how often do you revisit the framework such as that and maybe some of the factors that underpin it? Like for example, at some point, whether its three years, five years out the W2 records within the TWN database will mature. So how do we think about some of those longer term drivers of the business? Mark Begor : Yes, I think we put this in place a year ago and I believe that was the first change in Equifax's long term framework in like five or six years at least or maybe longer. The old framework was 7 to 10. We moved to 8 to 12, 100 basis points on the low end and 200 on the high end. It was intended to be a long term framework, and we could all talk about long term, but let's say five years plus, meaning we expect the company to grow, in that range, short of economic events. Those are, something you can't put in a long-term framework. But 8% to 12% growth for workforce in particular inside of the 8 to 12, and we talked about this already this morning. We have an expectation of them growing 13 to 15. That's their long term framework inside of our eight to 12, meaning they're going to be highly accretive and grow faster than the rest of Equifax. That's something that we expect as you point out, they've been outgrowing that 13 to 15, which sits inside of our eight to 12, which is good news in our eyes. That gives us confidence in the 13 to 15 over the long term. And of course, the 13 to 15 is made up of record editions. It's made up of new product rollouts. It's made up of penetration. And they've got uniquely a lot of penetration opportunities in all of their verticals because, our income and employment data is still a fairly new data asset. In the scheme of data assets, the credit file's been around for 70 years. Income and employment data has been around in a digitized way only for 15. So we've got a lot of confidence, in the 13 to 15 for workforce because of all of their growth levers, but also because they've been outgrowing that 13 to 15 for the last three or four years. And your question, I think you also asked the question about when will we revisit this? It's just, it's actually not even 12 months old. Our Investor Day was, I think on November 7th last year, so we're very confident and comfortable with what it is today after almost 12 months. And, at the right time if things change, we would look at it again. But we see no reason to change it and we still have a lot of confidence in it. Surinder Thind : That's helpful. And then maybe as a follow on, when we think about the contribution of new products to revenues as measured by the vitality index, so is that intended to be all growth on top of the existing revenue base, or is there some cannibalization of revenues that we need to consider or the, maybe the play between the two? How should we think about the actual measurement of that and what it means from a modeling perspective? Mark Begor : Yes. I think in the, in our long term framework John, we talked about new products in November last year, adding one to two points. John Gamble : Yes. You said vitality 10% so that\u2019s three year, right? Mark Begor : And that translated into, that was one of the drivers of us bringing up our long term growth rate from seven to 10 to eight to 12 was the increased new product rollouts, is going to be a factor of that change in our long-term growth rate and then add to it workforce solutions growing faster than the rest of Equifax at, approaching 50% of Equifax that's accretive to that growth rate if they're growing 13 to 15. And then the average for our long term is eight to 12. That's accretive. And then we believe the cloud completion and cloud competitiveness also is a factor in that change from seven to 10 to eight to 12. I don\u2019t know if that's helpful. John Gamble : And our vitality index is supposed to represent truly new products, right? I mean, certainly even new products can cannibalize an existing product, but they're not supposed to be tweaks, right? We don't tweak a product and call it a new product. It needs to be a product that's substantially different or substantially new to Equifax. Surinder Thind : So this would be clients generally buying these on top of whatever existing products they're buying. Mark Begor : Yes, there's clearly that it'll replace, some products, but they're generally, as John pointed out unique additions, and use the example I shared this morning of, the mortgage credit file that we've been delivering to the marketplace for 70 years in some fashion. We rolled out a new solution that's going to be our file plus this telco utility, cell phone data that's going to differentiate our mortgage credit file. That's a new product. Some customers will only buy the new product. Some will continue to buy just the credit file. That's really, so there is there some cannibalization could be, but there's also should be, we expect share gain, meaning our credit files more valuable than our competitor's credit file because the addition of that unique data to it. Surinder Thind : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I\u2019d now like to turn the call back over to Trevor Burns for any closing comments. Trevor Burns : Thanks everybody for your time today. If you have any follow-up questions feel free to reach out. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. We appreciate your participations. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Trevor Burns, Head of Equifax Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Trevor Burns : Thanks, and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Trevor Burns. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the IR Calendar section of the News & Events tab at our IR website, www.investor.equifax.com. During the call today, we\u2019ll be making reference to certain materials that can also be found in the Presentation section of the News & Events tab at our IR website. These materials are labeled Q4 2022 earnings conference call. Also, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including first quarter and full year 2023 guidance. We hope you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors may impact our business forth in filings with the SEC, including 2021 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. We'll also be making certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS for Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and can be found in the financial results section of the Financial Info tab at our IR website. In the fourth quarter, Equifax incurred restructuring charge of $24 million, or $0.15 a share. This charge was principally incurred to reduce headcount in 2023 as we realign our business functions ahead of completing our technology transformation. This restructuring charge is excluded from adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark on Slide 4. Mark Begor : Thanks, Trevor, and good morning. Equifax delivered another very strong quarter to close out 2022 with continuing execution against our EFX 2025 strategic priorities. Fourth quarter reported revenue of $1.2 billion was down about 4.5% and down 4% on an organic constant currency basis, both as expected against an unprecedented mortgage market decline, but above the high end of our October guidance from broad-based strength across Equifax and stronger NPI rollouts. Fourth quarter adjusted Equifax EBITDA totaled $371 million with an EBITDA margin of 31%. Adjusted EPS of $1.52 per share was at the upper end of our October guidance range of $1.45 to $1.55 per share, and John will provide more detail in a few minutes. Equifax US mortgage revenue was down 41% in the quarter, but outperformed the overall market by 27 percentage points with estimated US mortgage originations down 68%. Our global non-mortgage businesses, which represented about 84% of total revenue in the fourth quarter, were very strong with 12% constant currency and 10% organic constant currency revenue growth, stronger than we expected when we provided guidance in October and at the top end of our 8% to 12% long-term growth framework. This strong growth was driven again by outstanding performance at Workforce Solutions with 17% non-mortgage revenue growth overall and 23% non-mortgage revenue growth in Verifier. As I'll discuss more later, Government continued very strong in Workforce Solutions with growth at over 40%, and Talent and I-9 boarding delivered over 20% growth but were impacted by slowing US hiring in November and December. Delivering 20% growth in that vertical against a slowing hiring market was a very strong performance. And second, USIS nonmortgage had an outstanding quarter, delivering very strong double-digit B2B non-mortgage growth of 10% total and 19% online, which was much better than our expectations. And last, International delivered another strong quarter with 9% constant dollar and 8% organic constant dollar growth, led by very strong performance in Latin America. We continue to make strong progress against the final chapter of our EFX cloud data and technology transformation in 2022. Currently, about 70% of North American revenue is delivered from the new Equifax Cloud. During 2022, we made the decision to increase capital spending by approximately $175 million to a total of $625 million to accelerate the completion of our North American cloud transformation. The progress made in 2022 will enable the substantial completion of North America transformation and customer migrations this year, including decommissioning of applications in our major North America data centers. Capital spending will decline significantly in 2023 due to the strong progress at completing the cloud last year. Our new EFX Cloud infrastructure is delivering always-on capabilities and faster new product innovation with integrated data sets, faster data delivery and industry-leading enterprise-level security. We're convinced that our EFX Cloud and Single Data Fabric will provide a competitive advantage to Equifax for years to come. New product innovation is also executing at a very high level. Our new product Vitality Index of 14% in the quarter is a record and a 500 basis point improvement from the 9% Vitality Index last year and 400 basis points above our 10% long-term new product vitality goal. Our focus on new solutions, leveraging the new Equifax Cloud is paying off. As a reminder, our Vitality Index is the percentage of Equifax revenue from new products launched in the past three years. As our fourth quarter performance highlights, we continue to execute very well, driving strong non-mortgage growth across Equifax and record levels of new product revenue. In addition to accelerating long-term revenue growth, two critical goals of our EFX 2025 strategic framework are significant and consistent EBITDA margin expansion and the lowering of the capital intensity of our business to drive our free cash flow. In 2023, we are executing a broad operational restructuring across Equifax, reflecting both the acceleration of our cloud transformation and a broader focus on operational process improvements. We will reduce our total workforce of over 23,500 employees and contractors by over 10% during 2023 as well as delivering cost reductions from the closure of major North American data centers as we complete the cloud and other broader spending controls. Total spending reductions from these actions in 2023 are expected to be about $200 million with about $120 million reduction in expenses and an $80 million reduction in CapEx. I'll cover our 2023 plan in more detail shortly, but first, we'll provide more detail on our strong performance in the fourth quarter. Turning to Slide 5. In the fourth quarter, we continued our strong non-mortgage performance with revenue growth up 12% in constant currency, led by EWS Verification Services non-mortgage revenue, which was up 23%, led by Talent, which was up 19% and Government up 43%; EWS, I-9 and onboarding, which was up over 40%; USIS B2B online mortgage was up almost 20%; and Latin America was up over 30%, all very strong performances. Fourth quarter constant dollar non-mortgage growth of 12% was at the top end of our 8% to 12% long-term revenue framework despite some slowdown in the US hiring activity impacting our Workforce Solutions Talent vertical. Non-mortgage revenue growth continues to be very strong across Equifax. Turning to Slide 6. Workforce Solutions delivered another outstanding quarter. Mortgage revenue outperformed the overall mortgage market as measured by originations by about 30% in the fourth quarter and 38% for the full year. And verifier non-mortgage revenue was again very strong with organic growth of 23% in the quarter and 40% for the total year. During 2022, we signed 10 new agreements with US payroll processors, including four in the quarter that will be added to the TWN database during 2023. Recently, we also signed a substantial direct relationship that added over 2 million new TWN records. These new partnerships, along with continued growth in existing partner records and the new direct contributors through our Employer Services business, are delivering continuing strong growth in our TWN database with current records of 6 million record sequentially, reaching 142 million records -- 152 million records with 114 million unique and over 600 million total current historical records from over 2.6 million employers. Industry-leading data security and operational processes as well as our ability to provide substantial value to our direct contributors and revenue share to our payroll partners are delivering exceptional record growth for Workforce Solutions. 114 million unique individuals in TWN deliver high hit rates and represent almost 70% of the 165 million US non-farm payroll. Adding gig and pension records, we have the ability to almost double our TWN records in the future, which is a big driver of EWS revenue and margins. As a reminder, about 50% of our records are contributed directly by individual employers, with the remaining contributed through partnerships principally with payroll companies. Workforce Solutions also continues to lead Equifax and new products, delivering a Vitality Index at over 2x of our long-term 10% vitality goal, which is a great proof point for the power of the Equifax Cloud to drive innovation in new products. Workforce Solutions Vitality Index has expanded from low single digits a short four years ago to over 20% vitality in 2022. Workforce Solutions, as you know, was the first Equifax business to be substantially complete with their cloud transformation over a year ago, allowing the team to fully focus on innovation and NPIs, leveraging their new cloud capabilities. The Work Number is also seeing accelerated expansion outside the United States in the UK, Canada and Australia. In January, Workforce Solutions signed an agreement with a leading UK payroll technology partner, obtaining access to over 40% of UK private sector employees. Workforce Solutions now has access to over 20 million active and historical records in Australia, Canada and the UK in addition to over 40 million active and historical alternative income records, including pension data and tax returns. Turning to Slide 7. Workforce Solutions delivered revenue of $508 million, down 4% in the fourth quarter. Revenue was slightly weaker than expected driven by slower growth in talent and onboarding businesses from declines we saw in US hiring in November and December. Verification Services revenue of $399 million was down 7%, driven by the unprecedented 68% decline in US mortgage originations. As mentioned earlier, EWS mortgage revenue outperformed the overall market by a very strong 30 percentage points, driven by strong TWN record additions, penetration, pricing and new product revenue growth with the strong adoption of our new mortgage 36 solution that was rolled out late last year. Verification Services non-mortgage revenue, which now represents almost 70% of Verifier revenue, delivered strong 23% growth in the quarter. We saw continued very strong 43% growth in the Government vertical, which is almost 45% of Verifier non-mortgage revenue, driven by strong growth in our Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services volumes. The EWS government vertical is benefiting from penetration, pricing, record growth and leveraging a strong new product portfolio, including our new insights data at the federal state and local level. We expect to continue this strong growth in our government vertical in 2023 in a big $2 billion TAM. Talent Solutions delivered strong 19% growth in the quarter despite the impact of the weakening overall hiring, which is estimated to be down about 8% in the quarter. We outgrew this market decline by over 25 percentage points and delivered 19% growth, a very strong performance, driven by continued penetration of our digital solutions and background screening, strong new product growth, continued expansion of TWN records and favorable pricing. In the first quarter, we will launch new products in the talent space targeted at the staffing and hourly segments designed to meet specific needs of background screeners in these high-volume segments, which will drive Talent growth. Employer Services revenue of $110 million was up 4.5% in the quarter due to strong growth in our I-9 onboarding and healthy FX businesses, which were up 17%. Our I-9 and onboarding businesses remained strong at 20% growth but were also negatively impacted by the declines in US hiring late in 2022. Our unemployment claims and employee retention credit businesses were down 11%, driven by lower jobless claims and lower ERC transactions as the COVID federal tax program expires. Despite the slowdown in hiring, we have not seen a meaningful increase in UC transactions yet. Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margins of 46.8% were lower than our October guidance, principally due to lower revenue growth in talent and onboarding related to the slowdown in US hiring. We expect EWS margins to return to about 50% in the first quarter and will be above 50% for all of 2023. The strength of EWS and uniqueness in value of their TWN income and employment data in Employer Services businesses were clear again in 2022. Rudy Ploder and the EWS team delivered another outstanding quarter, outperforming the mortgage originations by 30 points and delivering strong 17% non-mortgage revenue growth. EWS is expected to deliver a strong 2023 and continue above market growth in the future. As shown on Slide 8, USIS revenue of $406 million was down 6.5% and slightly better than our expectations. USIS mortgage revenue was down about 46% and was in line with our expectations against an unprecedented 54% decline in credit inquiries compared to the 50-plus percent in our October guidance -- 50-plus percent decline that we had in our October guidance. Revenue outperformance relative to credit inquiries was strong at 8%, driven by favorable new mortgage business penetration, new mortgage products and new mortgage pricing. Credit inquiry performance continues to be less negative than estimated originations, reflecting higher relative levels of mortgage shopping behavior that we talked about before. At $67 million, mortgage revenue is now about 15% of total USIS revenue. B2B non-mortgage revenue of $280 million -- $288 million, which represents over 70% [ph] of total USIS revenue was up 10%, with organic revenue growth of about 6.5%. This was a significant sequential increase and much stronger than the levels we expected in October. Importantly, B2B non-mortgage online revenue growth was very strong at up 19% total and up over 13% organically, reflecting pricing and product rollouts as well as stronger volumes in banking as lenders continue to drive new originations. During the quarter, we saw strong double-digit revenue growth in commercial, identity and fraud and auto with banking at just under 10% growth. Financial Marketing Services, our B2B offline business had revenue of $72 million that was down 9% and slightly above our expectations. As we discussed during the year, we expect FMS to return to growth in 2023 with revenue up low single digits in the first quarter. USIS Consumer Solutions business had revenue of $50 million in the fourth quarter, up 8% from penetration and new product introductions. In 2023, we expect low single-digit growth from our US consumer direct business. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 35.3% in the quarter, up 120 basis points sequentially due to very strong double-digit B2B online non-mortgage revenue growth. EBITDA margins were down 400 basis points compared to prior year to declines in high-margin mortgage revenue. International revenue, as shown on Slide 9, was $284 million, up a strong 9% in constant currency and 8% organically. We're seeing broad-based execution from our international businesses with particular strength in Latin America NPI rollouts. Europe local currency revenue was up 3%, principally driven by 9% growth in our debt management business. We continue to see strong debt placements from the UK government as we have over the past several quarters. Our UK and Spain CRA business revenue was about flat in the fourth quarter and below our expectations principally due to lower new business penetration. Asia Pacific, which is our Australia business, delivered local currency revenue of 6%, driven by growth in our commercial, consumer, identity and fraud and HR identification businesses. Latin America, local currency revenue was up a strong 31% driven by very strong double-digit growth in Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Central America from new product introductions and pricing actions. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of strong double-digit growth for the Latin American team. Canada local currency revenue was up 7% and above our expectations. Growth in consumer, commercial, analytical solutions and identity and fraud revenue were partially offset by mortgage volume declines and lower direct-to-consumer revenue. International adjusted EBITDA margins at 25.8% were down 100 basis points sequentially and below our expectations due to a greater mix of lower-margin debt services revenue and higher costs principally from purchase data. Turning to Slide 10. 2022 was an outstanding year for new product innovation, and as you know, NPIs are central to our EFX 2025 growth strategy. We delivered over 100 new products for the third year in a row and a record full year Vitality Index of over 13% and a fourth quarter Vitality Index of 14%. The 13% Vitality Index in 2022 was up over 400 basis points above our strong 2021 results and over 300 basis points higher than our 10% long-term growth framework goal for new products and our vitality. New product revenue in 2022 was $650 million, up over 50% from about $420 million in 2021. And in 2022, over 90% of new product revenue was from non-mortgage products. Leveraging our new Equifax Cloud capabilities to drive new product rollouts, we expect to deliver a Vitality Index in 2023 at levels similar to the 13% we delivered in 2022 which is well above our 10% long-term NPI Vitality Index goal. And this equates to over $700 million of revenue in 2023 from new products introduced in the past three years. New products leveraging our differentiated data, our new EFX Cloud capabilities and Single-Data Fabric are central to our long-term growth framework and are driving Equifax top line growth and margins. Turning to Slide 11. 2022 was also a strong year for bolt-on acquisitions as we continue to focus on our strategic M&A priorities and growing our non-mortgage revenue. Since 2021, we've completed 13 acquisitions that are delivering $450 million of principally non-mortgage run rate revenue. Our 8% to 12% long-term growth framework includes 1 to 2 points of annual revenue growth from strategic bolt-on M&A aligned around our three strategic priorities : number one, expanding and strengthening Workforce Solutions, our fastest-growing and most profitable business; number two, building out our identity and fraud capabilities; and number three, adding unique data assets. We expect these strategic acquisitions to deliver growth synergies in 2023 and 2024 as we complete their technology and product integrations. Last week, we announced the acquisition of the Food Industry Credit Bureau, leading provider of credit information for the Canadian food industry, with over 90% commercial data coverage. This acquisition expands our commercial product offerings in Canada. We also continue to work closely with the Board of Directors of Boa Vista Servicos, the second largest credit bureau in Brazil on the proposed acquisition we announced in December. When completed, the BVS acquisition will add $160 million of run rate revenue in the fast-growing Brazilian market. The transaction is subject to Boa Vista shareholder approval and other customary closing conditions. To the extent we're able to finalize terms with the Boa Vista Board, we expect the transaction to close in mid-2023. Turning to 2023 guidance on Slide 12. We ended the year with significant momentum in the underlying growth of our businesses and in the execution of our EFX 2025 strategic priorities. However, we also entered 2023 with a continuing decline in the mortgage market and broader economic uncertainty impacting our underlying markets. Our assumption for US mortgage market originations is a further decline of 30% in 2023, which is more than 30% below the lowest level of originations in the past 10 years. For perspective, MBA is currently forecasting 2023 origination units down about 22% versus our 30% assumption -- minus 30% assumption. Fannie and Freddie do not forecast units but are forecasting origination dollar volumes down 30% and 25%, respectively. In our planning, we've assumed the bulk of the mortgage declines in the first half with first quarter originations down about 55%. Secondly, in 2022, we saw hiring freezes and headcount constraints impact our background screening volume in November and December, and we expect these conditions to continue in 2023 with hiring down over 10% impacting our Talent Solutions and I-9 employee onboarding businesses. Even with these market impacts or market declines, we expect both businesses to grow over 10%. Finally, in our planning, we're expecting to see weakening in our key markets in the US, Canada, UK and Canada in 2023. We're assuming slowing growth in the US as we move through the year, although at this point, we have not assumed the US recession. Similarly, we are expecting to see economic slowdowns in Australia and Canada with perhaps a more significant slowdown in the UK. The slow growth in these markets compares to the 2% to 2.5% underlying economic growth, we assume in our long-term growth model. As we enter 2023, we have strong underlying growth across our businesses with execution of our EFX 2025 growth strategies. Despite the significant decline in the US mortgage market and slower economic growth across our major markets, we expect to deliver revenue growth at the midpoint of 4% in 2023. Total mortgage revenue should decline about 8%, over 20 points better than the 30% reduction in mortgage originations, and non-mortgage revenue should grow over 8%, which is within our long-term growth framework despite the slower economic growth in our major markets. We expect Workforce Solutions to deliver revenue growth of about 6% in 2023. This reflects a mortgage revenue decline of about 8% or over 20 points stronger than the expected 30% decline in mortgage originations. EWS non-mortgage verticals are expected to grow about 13% overcoming the expected 10% plus decline in US hiring and about 15% decline in our ERC businesses as that COVID program winds down. TWN record growth, strong new product rollouts and continued strong growth in both pricing and penetration will continue to drive Workforce Solutions outperformance. We expect USIS to deliver revenue growth of about 2% this year. Mortgage revenue is expected to decline about 7%, more than 20% -- 20 points stronger than the expected 30% decline in mortgage originations. In 2023, USIS will begin to benefit from their new mortgage credit file that was rolled out late last year that includes telecommunications, pay TV and utilities attributes to help streamline the mortgage underwriting process and support loans with the secondary mortgage market. Equifax is the first and only in the industry to provide these insights, which will be available to Equifax customers in the first quarter and can help create greater home opportunities for consumers across the US. We're also seeing the impact of pricing increases from one of our largest mortgage vendors that we pass on to customers at levels to maintain consistent margins. Non-mortgage revenue is expected to grow about 5% despite the slowing growth. Non-mortgage revenue growth of about 5% will be driven by strong commercial, identity and fraud banking and auto growth. And Financial Marketing Services expect to return to growth in 2023 after a disappointing 2022. International had a very strong 2022 with revenue up 12% in constant dollars, but we saw some weakening end markets late in the year, particularly in debt services. We expect International growth of 5% in constant currency in 2023. This is below our long-term growth framework for International of 7% to 9%, principally due to the expected weakening economic conditions in our major markets of the UK, Canada and Australia and also a decline in debt services off a very strong 2022. As we discussed last year, debt services revenue in 2022 was somewhat of a catch-up year as the UK government collections were put on hold during the COVID pandemic. We continue to expect international to operate within their 7% to 9% growth framework over the mid and long-term. NPIs will again be very strong, which is -- and consistent with last year's 13% Vitality Index, well above our 10% long-term vitality goal, and this will be led by Workforce Solutions in Latin America. As USIS and Canada complete their cloud transformation, we expect their NPI rollouts to accelerate as we exit 2023. As we complete our North American cloud transformation 2023, we will pivot to leveraging our differentiated data assets and new cloud infrastructure to drive new product rollouts and top line growth. Workforce Solutions will accelerate its focus on leveraging their new cloud capabilities, and USIS and Canada will complete their consumer credit, alternative data and IFS transformation this year. These are big milestones in completing the cloud that we've been building towards for almost five years. We're on track to deliver the cost and capital spending reductions from the cloud transformation that are central to our long-term growth framework. As I referenced earlier and as shown on Slide 13, our accelerated cloud transformation cost reductions and broader cost restructuring will deliver $200 million of cost and CapEx savings in 2023 that will expand our margins and free cash flow in the future. During 2023, we plan to reduce our total workforce of about 23,500 employees and contractors by over 10%. As we complete our North American cloud transformation in 2023, we expect to close about 15 data centers, consolidate development centers and continue to reduce our software application footprint, and we'll closely manage discretionary spending, including professional services. We expect these actions to deliver $200 million in spending reductions in 2023, representing $120 million cost and expense reductions or about $0.75 per share and $80 million in capital spending reductions. The savings in the first quarter are limited and accelerate in the second quarter and through the second half of 2023. In 2024, the run rate benefit of these actions will reduce our spending by over $250 million. The lower cost and capital spending accelerates as we move through 2023 from cloud transformation cost benefits and other costs and restructuring actions planned throughout the year. As shown on Slide 14, adjusted EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS improved significantly as we moved through 2023. In the first quarter, revenue is expected to be down 6% due to the about 55% reduction in mortgage originations. EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS are at their lowest levels in 2023 in the first quarter, principally due to the higher incremental margins from the declining mortgage revenue and the timing of the recognition of the majority of our annual equity incentive plan expense in the quarter. Normalizing for this timing compared to the fourth quarter, first quarter EBITDA margins are slightly below fourth quarter margins of 31%. As revenue growth improve throughout 2023 and cloud and broader cost reductions accelerate, EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS improve sequentially with EBITDA margins expected to exceed 36% and adjusted EPS exceeding $2 per share in the fourth quarter. For the full year, EBITDA will be up 4% or $70 million, in line with revenue growth, with margins flat to the 33.6% we delivered last year. Adjusted EPS is expected to be about $7.20 per share, down about 5% from 2022, principally reflecting higher depreciation and amortization of about $50 million as North American cloud system implementations principally completes, also from higher interest and other expense of about $60 million and a higher tax rate. Capital spending will decline by $65 million to about $545 million in the year, or about 10% of revenue as we move closer to completing our cloud transportation. We expect CapEx to decline again in 2024. We have a clear line of sight to executing these proactive actions that will expand our margins and drive our free cash flow. In addition to cost benefits, completing our North American cloud transformation will enable significant commercial benefits to drive market share and revenue growth, including our always-on capabilities, better data quality, faster data delivery and faster new product innovation. And we're beginning to see meaningful commercial benefits from our new Equifax Cloud technology transformation. And now I'd like to turn it over to John to provide more detail on our 2023 assumptions and guidance and also provide our guidance for the first quarter. Our 2023 guidance builds on our strong 2022 non-mortgage growth from new products, record growth, pricing and acquisition synergies. John? John Gamble : Thanks, Mark. Before we discuss 2023, I'll share a little more detail on 4Q 2022. As Mark referenced earlier, Equifax EBITDA margins came in slightly lower than expected in the fourth quarter at 31%, principally driven by lower-than-expected margins in Workforce Solutions, as Mark discussed, and also in International. Capital spending in the fourth quarter was $156 million, as we maintained investments to accelerate completion of North American cloud transformation. Capital spending will decline in 1Q 2022 to 2023 about $150 million and then sequentially further in each quarter of 2023, as we complete significant US and Canadian customer migrations. Total capital spending in 2023 is expected to be about $545 million. CapEx as a percent of revenue will continue to decline in 2024 and thereafter as we progress toward reaching 7% of revenue or below. Moving on to 2023 guidance. Mark provided an overview of our planning assumptions of a 30% reduction in mortgage originations in 2023. As shown on Slide 15, at these levels, and again, using credit inquiries as a proxy for the mortgage market, in 2023, the US mortgage market will be substantially below any level we have seen in the past 10 years. 1Q 2023 is expected to see the mortgage market down about 55% year-to-year. Sequentially, as we move through 2023, we're planning on a more normal pattern of mortgage activity with mortgage originations increasing sequentially on the order of 15% in 2Q 2023 from 1Q 2023, 3Q 2023 being about flat with the second quarter and normal sequential decline in the fourth quarter versus 3Q 2023. We expect with these sequential patterns, US mortgage originations would be up slightly in the second half of 2023 versus the first half of 2023, and the fourth quarter of 2023 would be up slightly year-to-year. And at least the first half of 2023, we are expecting USIS to benefit from mortgage shopping behavior with better performance than originations. Slide 16 provides a revenue walk detailing the drivers of the 4% revenue growth to the midpoint of our 2023 revenue guidance of $5.325 billion. The 30% decline in the US mortgage market is negatively impacting 2023 total revenue growth by about 7 percentage points. The mortgage revenue outperformance relative to the mortgage market is expected to offset about 5 points of the negative 7 percentage point impact of the mortgage market on overall revenue growth. As a result, the expected 8% decline in Equifax mortgage revenue has a negative about 2 percentage point impact on overall revenue growth. Non mortgage organic growth is expected to exceed 7% on a constant currency basis and is driving about 5% of the growth in overall Equifax revenue. As Mark referenced earlier, the growth is broad-based across all three BUs and is within our long-term framework of 7% to 10%, despite the economic uncertainty across our major markets in the US, Australia, Canada and the UK. The acquisitions completed in 2022 and year-to-date are expected to contribute about 1% of growth to 2023. For clarity, this does not include revenue from the potential acquisition of Boa Vista. Slide 17 provides an adjusted EPS walk detailing the drivers of the expected 5% decline to the midpoint of our 2023 adjusted EPS guidance of $7.20 per share. Revenue growth of 4% at our 2022 EBITDA margins of about 33.6% would deliver 5.5% growth in adjusted EPS. EBITDA margins in 2023 are expected to be about flat from the 33.6% we delivered in 2022. In 2023, the cost actions we are taking are expected to deliver about $120 million of expense reductions. These cost benefits are being principally offset by several factors. First, in 2022, variable compensation, including incentive and sales comp were at very low levels due to the substantial impact of the weak mortgage market on our performance. In 2023, our planning assumes we return to targeted levels of performance, and therefore, these compensation drivers. Royalties and cost for data and third-party scores are increasing as we continue to add new partners and broaden data sources. Also in 2023, we are also still incurring a level of redundant system costs as we continue to operate legacy North American systems prior to their decommissioning later in 2023. As we look beyond 2023, the impact of variable compensation moving to target and the cost of redundant systems in North America are behind us, and therefore, the benefits of our cost actions as well as accelerating high variable profit revenue growth are expected to drive significant improvement in EBITDA margins. Depreciation and amortization is expected to increase by just over $50 million in 2023, which will negatively impact adjusted EPS by about 4%. D&A is increasing in 2023 as we accelerate putting cloud native systems in production. The combined increase in interest expense, net other expense and tax expense in 2023 is expected to negatively impact adjusted EPS by just over six percentage points. The increase in interest expense reflects the impact of higher interest rates and also the increased debt from our 2022 acquisitions. Our estimated tax rate of about 26% is up about 150 basis points from 2022 due to a higher mix of non-US revenue and lower tax benefits as we reduce capital and development spending. Slide 18 provides the specifics of our 2022 full year guidance that Mark discussed in detail. The slide includes additional detail on expected BU EBITDA margins as well as guidance on specific P&L line items. EWS EBITDA margins in 2023 of 52% are expected to be up from the 51.3% delivered in 2022, given the strong non-mortgage revenue growth from new products, penetration and pricing and the benefits of the cost actions Mark discussed earlier. USIS EBITDA margins at over 35% are expected to be down from the 36.8% delivered in 2022. USIS is also benefiting from cost actions. However, revenue growth at 2%, again, due to the impact of the US mortgage market decline, is resulting in the year-to-year margin decline. International EBITDA margins at 27% are expected to expand versus the 25.7% delivered in 2022, driven principally by pricing and the 2023 cost actions. Corporate expense, excluding depreciation and amortization, is increasing in 2023 relative to 2022 due to the increases in incentive and equity compensation from the lower levels incurred in 2022 that I referenced earlier. Corporate functions such as finance, legal, HR and others are reducing costs in 2023, consistent with our cost actions. We believe that our guidance is centered at the midpoint of both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges. Slide 19 provides our guidance for 1Q 2023. As Mark discussed earlier, 1Q 2023 is expected to have the largest year-to-year decline in the US mortgage market that we'll see in 2023 at down about 55% as we compare to the relatively strong mortgage market in the first quarter of 2022. Despite the strong expected non-mortgage constant currency growth of about 9%, we will see a decline in 1Q 2023 revenue about 6% at the midpoint of our guidance. 1Q 2023 EBITDA margins are expected to be about 29%, down about 200 basis points sequentially. Overall, BU EBITDA margins in total are up sequentially from 4Q 2022 driven by Workforce Solutions delivering about 50% EBITDA margins in the quarter, which offsets declines at USIS and International. The decline in EBITDA margins in 1Q 2023 sequentially from 4Q 2022 is driven by higher corporate expense, specifically the higher incentive and equity compensation costs referenced earlier. The bulk of the expense related to our equity plans occurs in the first quarter and is reflected in corporate. Excluding the impact from the sequential increase in equity compensation expense, EBITDA margins are approaching flat sequentially at just under 31%. Corporate expenses will decrease meaningfully sequentially in 2Q 2023 as the equity compensation was principally reflected in the first quarter. Revenue increases sequentially in 1Q 2023 relative to 4Q 2022. We're not seeing the expected increase in EBITDA margin sequentially in the first quarter, driven by the same factors impacting all of 2023 that I referenced earlier and the fact that there is limited first quarter benefit related to our 2023 cost actions. In the second quarter of 2023, we will see both the benefit of reduced corporate expense and increased benefits from our 2023 cost action supporting growth and EBITDA margins. Business unit performance in the first quarter are expected to be as described below. Workforce Solutions revenue growth is expected to be down about 8.5% year-to-year due to the about 55% decline in the mortgage market. Non-mortgage revenue will continue to deliver double-digit growth. EBITDA margins are expected to be about 50%, up over 300 basis points sequentially, driven by sequential revenue growth from new product and pricing actions. Workforce Solutions will represent just under 50% of Equifax revenue in the quarter. USIS revenue is expected to be down about 5.5% year-to-year, again, driven by the about 55% decline in the US mortgage market. USIS credit inquiries are expected to somewhat outperform the overall mortgage market due to consumer shopping. The mortgage decline is partially offset by growth in non-mortgage expected to be up mid single digits. EBITDA margins are expected to be about 32%, down sequentially due to negative mix from growth in core mortgage and higher overall mortgage royalties as well as the normalization of incentive costs that I referenced earlier. USIS is also incurring incremental costs from customer migrations to data fabric that are occurring principally in the first half of 2023. International revenue is expected to be up about 5% in constant currency. The weakness relative to the strong 4Q 2022 growth of about 9% is principally a decline in the UK debt management business as we are now comparing to the very strong 2022 revenue driven by catch-up in our UK government business in 2022 as the UK government suspended collections during the pandemic. EBITDA margins are expected to be about 22%, down sequentially due to seasonally lower revenue in Canada and UK CRA and normalization of incentive costs as well as higher data costs. We're expecting adjusted EPS in the first quarter of 2023 to be about $1.30 to $1.40 per share. Looking forward, we remain focused on delivering our midterm goal of $7 billion of revenue with 39% EBITDA margins. Market conditions are significantly different than when we first discussed in November of 2021, our goal of achieving these results in 2025. The US mortgage market is expected in 2023 to be down over 35% from the normal 2015 to 2019 average levels we had discussed is expected to deliver $7 billion of revenue in 2025. Our core organic revenue has grown over 300 basis points faster than we discussed with you in November of 2021. However, recovery in the mortgage market around the order of two-thirds of the lost volume is still likely needed to achieve our $7 billion goal in 2025. We're focused on driving above-market growth including -- through accretive acquisitions and delivering the cost and expense improvements committed as part of our data and technology cloud transformation and needed to achieve 39% EBITDA margins. We'll continue to discuss with you our progress toward our $7 billion and 39% EBITDA margin goals as the mortgage and overall markets evolve in 2023 and forward. Now I'd like to turn it back over to Mark. Mark Begor : Thanks, John. Wrapping up on Slide 20. Equifax delivered another strong and broad-based quarter with above-market growth in 2022, more than offsetting the significant 55% decline in the US mortgage market originations. We delivered our eighth consecutive quarter of strong above-market double-digit core revenue growth and strong double-digit 12% non-mortgage growth, reflecting the power of the EFX business model and our execution against our EFX 2025 strategic priorities. At the business unit level, first, Workforce Solutions had another outstanding year, powering our results, delivering 14% revenue growth and strong organic non-mortgage growth of 24%. TWN current records reached $152 million, up 12%, and total records surpassed 600 million. Workforce also delivered a Vitality Index of over 20% from innovative new products and solutions, leveraging their cloud capabilities while further penetrating the high-growth Talent and Government verticals. USIS had a very strong finish to 2022 with fourth quarter non-mortgage growth of 10% total and 7% organic, driven by online non-mortgage growth of 19% total and 13% organic. The USIS team remains competitive and is winning in the marketplace. International delivered 12% local currency growth, their second consecutive year of double-digit growth. And our 2022 Vitality Index of 13% was a record as we delivered over 100 new products for the third consecutive year in a row. And since 2021, we completed 13 strategic bolt-on acquisitions to strengthen Equifax and identity and fraud that we expect to deliver over $450 million of principally run rate revenue going forward. And sixth, we made significant progress in 2022, executing against our EFX cloud, data and technology transformation with about 70% of North American revenue being delivered from the new Equifax Cloud. And we're laser-focused on completing our North American migration in 2023 to become the only cloud-native data analytics company. We're in the early days of leveraging our new cloud capabilities but remain confident that it will differentiate us commercially, expand our NPI capabilities and accelerate our top line. Our strong progress on the cloud allowed us to accelerate cost savings and launch a proactive restructuring across Equifax that will deliver $200 million of cost savings in 2023 that will expand our margins to 36% as we exit 2023 and position us for an uncertain economic environment. As we look to 2023, we're committed to completing our North American data and technology transformation, while delivering continued above-market revenue growth and a substantial and consistent EBITDA margin growth and a reduction in capital intensity that is a key benefit of our data and technology cloud transformation. As mentioned earlier, the cost actions were taken in 2023 reducing our spending by $200 million this year and over $250 million in 2024 will expand our margins and position us for a more uncertain economic environment. I'm energized about our strong above-market performance in 2022, but even more energized about the future of the new Equifax in 2023 and beyond. We're convinced that our new EFX cloud-based technology, differentiated data assets that are now in our single-data fabric and our market-leading businesses will deliver higher growth, expanded margins and free cash flow in the future. And with that, operator, let me open it up to questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions. Manav Patnaik : Thank you. Good morning. Mark, you said you assumed a weakening economy pretty much globally but not a recession. But I guess my question is more the weakness that you've assumed, the magnitude of what you're seeing already today versus what you're assuming gets worse, if that makes sense? Mark Begor : Yes. So I think there's a couple of levels there, Manav. As you know, we've been living through a mortgage market recession here in the United States for the last nine months and that's going to continue. And it's really unprecedented. So I think you and our investors understand that pretty clearly. It's really a massive impact on our business. And what's positive is our non-mortgage businesses are performing exceptionally well. We talked about where we've seen the impact of hiring declines in late in the year. We expect that to continue being down about 10% in 2023, and that impacts our Talent business and also our onboarding and online businesses. So that's certainly in our outlook. And then we did factor in what we would characterize as an uncertain or slowing economic environment really more in the second half of 2023. It's hard to forecast where the economy is going to do, but it certainly feels like at these higher interest rates and higher inflation, and you've got the impact of mortgage and now in the hiring space that we're going to see slowdowns as we go through 2023. Manav Patnaik : Got it. Just to clarify on that. I guess, can you talk about what you assume more on the, call it, card and auto side because those things still find today that -- how much you're assuming? And then, John, just for you on free cash flow. Can you just walk us through what the working capital moves this year was and how we should think about what free cash flow will be in 2023? Mark Begor : Yes. So on your first half of your question, John can take the second. You're correct, Manav. In a lot of verticals, we haven't seen that economic impact yet. We're expecting to see that as we go through 2023. So that's a part of our guide and a part of our outlook in verticals like cards, like P loans, like auto, we've seen some limited economic impacts there. But as you point out, cards, for example, are still operating quite well. But given where interest rates have been and where they're going and where the Fed is signaling they're going to take them and the challenge of taming inflation, we think it was prudent to include in our outlook for 2023 a softening of the economy as we go through the year. A \u2013 John Gamble : As you look around outside the US, right, we saw a weakening in the UK. That's already occurred, started to happen in the fourth quarter, and we saw relatively weaker performance in some of the other markets around the world as well. So to free cash flow -- so as we look through 2023, Manav, we're expecting to see expanding margins, as Mark talked about, and we're expecting to see, obviously, therefore, expanding EPS as well, and we're also expecting to bring down capital spending. So we expect to see very nice growth in free cash flow as we move through 2023 sequentially, as we go through the quarters. In terms of working capital, as we've discussed in prior calls, as we were going through a significant billing system migration, we did see some increase in our accounts receivable. The bulk of that is now completed. We've completed all of North America, and there's just -- there's a little bit more to go as we go through 2023 in some of our international operations. Our internal metrics are showing a nice improvement in terms of our operational performance in those systems in terms of what we're seeing in terms of collections activity. And so although we haven't really seen it yet in the numbers you would have seen in the fourth quarter, we're expecting to start to see some benefit as we move through 2023 in terms of AR, which would affect overall working capital. So net-net, I think free cash flow, we're expecting to see, obviously, expanding margins, improving profitability, lower CapEx and then improvements as we move through the year in working capital in general. Q \u2013 Manav Patnaik : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions. Q \u2013 Andrew Steinerman : Hi. John, I just want to make sure I understand the $120 million of OpEx reduction on Slide 13. Is this $120 million for 2023 could be realized in year, or is that a run rate by the end of the year? And then I have a follow-up question. A \u2013 Mark Begor : So that's realized in year. A \u2013 John Gamble : That's correct, yeah. A \u2013 Mark Begor : As John pointed out, those will be executed principally the actions of the contractors and attrition in some Equifax FTEs will be executed in the first quarter, so the benefits will accelerate as we go through second, third and fourth. And then as we said, we get a benefit -- positive benefit in 2024 from the full year impact of that. Q \u2013 Andrew Steinerman : Okay. And then on the $120 million of expense savings, OpEx savings, is this really an acceleration of the original plan, or does this add to total target cost savings of the cloud transformation? A \u2013 Mark Begor : Yeah. It's a combo of the two. We tried to be clear about that, Andrew, in our comments because of the extra efforts and additional work we did in 2022, it's allowed us to accelerate the cloud savings that we've talked to you about for multiple years. So a big piece of the $120 million is the cloud savings, but there's a meaningful increment to that of just a broader restructuring of the company to improve our efficiencies and how we operate the company. Some of that from the investments of the cloud that are outside of technology just allow us to operate more effectively. So it's a combo with the two. Andrew Steinerman : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Kyle Peterson with Needham & Company. Please proceed with your questions. Kyle Peterson : Great. Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to dig into the Talent Solutions piece. It definitely seems like there was some softness there compared to what you guys were expecting. And I know you kind of mentioned that hiring was a headwind and became more challenging. But I guess, was the softer result in that sub-segment of EWS, was that purely a kind of quantity and kind of hiring volume headwind, or did you see any clients like trading down to kind of less expensive products or doing anything else in kind of that area that might have caused some pressure? Mark Begor : No. Our analysis of it is it's all Q and when we talk to our customers, meaning there's just less background screens happening. I think we were watching this as we went through the fourth quarter. I think all of us saw companies as we went through the tail end of the year and they've accelerated in the first quarter here, announcing layoffs, announcing hiring freezes. That all is going to impact the hiring market. It's a bit bifurcated. I think we all know that the hiring at the, call it, the hourly wage area is still very strong. So that really wasn't impacted. This is more white collar impact, where companies are just tightening their belts and being more cautious around hiring. So we haven't seen any impact from our new product rollouts, the penetration that we have. And just as a reminder, this is a $2 billion TAM for us, is Talent. And we have a lot of penetration opportunities, meaning we're continuing to work in to bring new solutions and convert our customers from their manual work to digital, and that's what really allows us to outgrow a declining market, which we expect to continue to do in 2023. And then as we also mentioned, that same hiring impact where companies are tightening their belts around adding new resources impacted our onboarding or our I-9 business in the latter part of the year, we expect it to impact in 2022. As we said in the comments earlier, we expect both of those businesses to grow double-digit even with those market declines because of the new product capabilities, the new penetration opportunities that we have and, of course, our normal pricing that we rolled out on a 1/1, on January 1. Kyle Peterson : Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess just my kind of follow-up was on pricing. I know kind of last quarter, you guys mentioned that pricing would be a tailwind in 2023 to margins. And I know like the 1Q guide kind of implies a couple of hundred basis points of pressure on EBITDA margins. I get some of that's seasonality. But is some of this that compared to what you guys saw in 4Q that just volumes in mortgage and some of the other areas are just facing pressure that's offsetting some of those price effects that went into place on 1/1, or did you got temper in any of those? Mark Begor : Yes, I'll let John jump in. No change in what we told you we were going to do in October and price and what we actually did. Obviously, what's happened is the mortgage market -- first off, we have a very challenging comp in the first quarter and the second quarter versus last year. A year ago, the mortgage market was super strong. So you start with that, and that was as expected, although as we talked about, we've reduced our mortgage outlook for 2023 from what we thought in October. So that puts pressure on the quarter and on the year, from a margin standpoint. There's some small pressure from the lower growth in talent and onboarding in I-9 because of the tightening belts around hiring taking place, but the bulk of the first quarter impact is what John described of, really, from a cost standpoint in 2022, our incentive compensation was well below target because of the decline in the mortgage market. As John said, we expect 2023 to be paying at target. So that's a higher expense to us. That flows through the year. And then we typically have in the first quarter when we make our retention equity grants to our team, an equity expense that takes place. And there, I don't know, what else would you add, John? A \u2013 John Gamble : No. Just in terms of price and product, you can see the benefit of price and product in the fourth quarter, obviously, in USIS. Very strong performance in online. We saw volume in banking. But we had very strong performance in auto and in banking and lending and cards. So -- and some of that was product and some of that was price. And you're certainly seeing it in the first quarter in EWS, right? As Mark mentioned, pricing increases going in January, and we're seeing the benefit of both product and price and in EWS with their margins expanding in the first quarter. So no difference, and you're seeing it in the performance of the business. A \u2013 Mark Begor : I think, John, you also said in your comments that if you look at first quarter versus fourth quarter and isolate around these expense items around incentive and equity, our margins are basically flat, which means we're absorbing a weaker mortgage market than the fourth quarter and still getting the benefits of operating leverage and price and everything else to kind of offset that ex the cost items that we had that we talked about. Q \u2013 Kyle Peterson : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions. Q \u2013 Kevin McVeigh : Great. Thanks. Obviously, still a lot of volatility in the mortgage market. Is there any way to think about kind of purchase versus refinance? And as you get into 2024, I know 2023 is hard enough, but do you expect a little bit more recovery in refinance off of 2022, or just any way to think about kind of that base level of originations and how it trends over the course of the year? A \u2013 Mark Begor : I'll let John jump in. As you might imagine, refi is virtually gone, right? Refi really disappeared from the mortgage market, I don't know, six months ago as rates started increasing. We don't anticipate refi coming back until there's a change in interest rates, meaning that there's some interest rate decline. What's really very unusual, and we've never seen before is the meaningful decline in purchase volume at this level. I think as John pointed out, our outlook for 2023 as mortgage inquiries 30% below the 10-year average. And that's really -- the 10-year average includes purchase and refi. So you've got purchase down dramatically. So at some point, purchase volume should improve. There's no question. If it's 30% below a 10-year average. Now we're assuming that doesn't happen in the second half. Should it improve in 2024, I think it's part of it's tied to what's happening in the economy. Are we stabilized around inflation and interest rates, if the interest rate increase has flattened out and consumers that are thinking about a home can have some confidence around where the economy is going. That should help purchase volume. But at some point, whether it's in 2024 or 2025, the mortgage market should move up on the purchase side as the economy stabilizes to get back to that, call it, 10-year average. It's never had this kind of an impact. Of course, we've never seen interest rate increases at this pace ever before. Add, John? John Gamble : I think you covered it quite well, yes. Kevin McVeigh : Great. And then just real quick, as you think about kind of -- you mentioned the gig and pension workers a couple of times. Is that aggregation process similar to the traditional kind of record aggregation, or is it -- how does that process occur? And is it at the same price point, or is it kind of less profitable? Mark Begor : Yes, no, they're very attractive records. We want them all. First, let me just make the point. We've got a long runway in traditional non-farm payroll. And I think as you saw a 12% growth last year in TWN records, was very, very strong. We signed, I think, 10 new partners that will come online in 2023. I think we said before that in our existing partners, think about payroll partners, there's meaningful records that we still haven't brought onboard with them. And there's a lot of incentives to do that. So that's kind of the base records. And over the last couple of years, we've scaled up resources that are going after pension records. I think it was in the third quarter last year, we signed our first pension partner to bring pension records into our data set. And we've got a pipeline of those. And process-wise, that's quite similar. If you think about pension records, they're probably in three different places, it's more than that, but three principal places. One is there are companies that are much like payroll processors that process defined benefit pensions for legacy companies that have those. So, going to those companies and developing those partnerships is strategy number one. Number two is large legacy companies process their own pension payroll, lots of them. So we're already collecting their employee payroll, so going in and collecting their pension payroll as a part of that strategy. So we know how to do that in just a matter of executing it. And then the third is in federal, state and local governments. Many of them have their own pension processing operations, so going to collect those records. So that's where we're going on the pension side. And then on the gig side, there's a lot of different strategies, individual companies, as you might imagine, going to get that and other entities that will have those gig records. And as we've talked before, it's the 114 million uniques that we have. There's about 220 million working Americans between non-farm payroll, gig and pension. So over the long-term, we've got the ability to double the scale of our records going forward. So that's a big lever for growth from workforce. I think as you know, the day we add a new record, we're able to monetize it instantly, because we're already getting inquiries for the record we don't have, right? With our 50-plus percent hit rates, as we add that 51st, 52nd set of data records, we're able to monetize instantly. So it's a very powerful part of the revenue engine and margin engine for Workforce Solutions, which is why we have such a dedicated team focusing on it. And if you think about the scale of our records, if you go back four years ago versus the 114 million uniques, we had something like 70 million and 300,000 companies. We ended last year with 2.6 million companies contributing their data to us. So the cloud has allowed us to really scale that, and there's a long runway for future growth. Q \u2013 Kevin McVeigh : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Kelsey Zhu with Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your questions. Q \u2013 Kelsey Zhu : Hey, guys. On EWS margin, just kind of playing devil's advocate here. I want to understand a little bit better what's the biggest risk factors for margins to drop below your guide at 52%. Is this just mortgage market down more than 30%? Is it fields overachieving their targets again in maybe government the verticals? Just wanted to understand it a little better? A \u2013 Mark Begor : John, this was on EWS margins. And the question was, we've said that we expect them to be 50-plus percent in 2023. What are the risks of that? A \u2013 John Gamble : Yeah. Let me talk about what's driving the margins to be at those levels, right? And it is heavily driven by what Mark talked about in terms of the record growth and therefore the outperformance relative to mortgage and the very, very strong non-mortgage growth. And then the cost actions that they're taking in order to not only maintain but enhance their margins as they go through the year, right? So EWS has been executing extremely well. Obviously, if the mortgage market was to be substantially weaker, that's very high revenue and high margin -- very high-margin revenue, that would be a risk. To the extent that there is risk to revenue in general, obviously, that can be risk to margins. But overall, we think we've taken a very reasonable view in terms of what 2023 looks like for EWS. Their execution has been very strong. The record growth has been very good. They've already executed their pricing actions. Their performance in new product has been outstanding, as Mark said, growing at twice the rate of our 10% goal for Vitality Index. So we feel like we've given a very balanced view of EWS as we look into 2022. A \u2013 Mark Begor : Maybe I just add to that, John. I think John mentioned, we rolled out our pricing actions late in the year in effective 1/1. So we know what those are. So that's kind of baked in. So that gives you a lot of confidence. As I mentioned earlier, and John did too, we already know some meaningful record additions that we've signed agreements for that will come in, in 2023. That's revenue and margin. We've got new products in workforce that were rolled out in 2022 that gets full year benefit in 2023. And we know our pipeline of new products we're expecting to roll out in the first quarter and second quarter from workforce going forward. So we think there's a -- we have a lot to give us confidence in our outlook there. And I think as John pointed out, to me, the factor would be if the economy is worse than we factored into this or if the mortgage market is significantly worse than we factored into this outlook, that would put pressure on that. And then we would take actions to respond to it. Q \u2013 Kelsey Zhu : Got it. Super helpful. And then just on Boa Vista, I think that would be a really nice addition to your LATAM portfolio. And I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on how you're thinking about their data assets and their strategy. On the merger -- on the acquisition call, you mentioned Boa Vista is very strong regionally. Is there a strategy to expand them kind of more towards nationally. Would appreciate any color you can share with us. A \u2013 Mark Begor : Yeah, sure. So first, we're working to try to finish the acquisition. We've been negotiating since December with the Board of Boa Vista. We're pleased with the progress, and we're -- we want to conclude that. So that's kind of priority number one. But everything we talked about in December, we're still quite energized about. First and foremost, we would bring all of the Equifax capabilities to Boa Vista, whether it's our new cloud technology our products from around the globe, our big platforms like Ignite and InterConnect, we'd really bring their capabilities up substantially versus what they have today as a standalone number two credit bureau in the market. So that is a real positive. And the underlying business is performing exceptionally well. They've got strong double-digit growth. It's a big market in Brazil that's expanding. There's a lot of alternative data available there that we would want to focus on. We just see a bunch of potential. As we pointed out, they have some unique data outside of the normal banking data that's unique to Boa Vista, which is another element that we like about it. So we're focused on completing our negotiations, so we can try to move forward in closing it. Kelsey Zhu : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with Truist. Please proceed with your questions. Andrew Jeffrey : Hi. Good morning. Appreciate you taking the question and all the details as usual guys. Mark, one of the things that happened, obviously, that drove your mortgage growth before the sort of collapse of the overall market was greater digital engagement. And I think you've talked to mortgage shopping a little bit today, too. Has -- given that mortgage volumes are down so much, purchase and refi, do you think there's anything that's structurally changed in the market such that your customers either want to engage more digitally with you or less digitally? So I guess what I'm asking is when mortgage recovers, is that lever, which was such a nice driver for you when volumes were booming, is that still there? Is it -- do you get more leverage, less leverage, about the same? Can we think about that structurally, if anything has changed? Mark Begor : Yes, it's a great question, and we believe that it's more leverage or more opportunity to really drive our digital solutions. And if you think about a mortgage originator, that clearly is under significant financial pressure now because of the reduced -- the reductions in volumes. They're looking to improve their productivity, and the only way to improve your productivity is through instant decisioning. And the goal that they always have and the leading players in the space are working to really shorten the time frame between application and closing. As you know, it's a very long time frame and that time frame has cost involved in it. It also has risk involved in it around the consumer changing. It has risk involved in it, and the consumer deciding, I'm not going to buy the home, meaning you've spent a bunch of COGS on it. And you've heard us talk before, the average mortgage originators spending $5,000 of expense in a mortgage application if they can shorten the time and take labor out of it by using instant data. That's a positive. So we expect our conversations around using our Instant data, particularly around TWN, to accelerate in this environment, meaning we're going to become more embedded and more instant, which has been a trend, as you know, over the last couple three years, even in the stronger mortgage environment. Some of that over the -- in 2020 and 2021 was challenged by the -- just the pace of the volume they had. They didn't have time to really focus on changing their processes. Now they do. So it's clearly a focus of ours, and we think a positive going forward that Instant is going to drive speed and drive productivity. And that doesn't only apply to mortgage, that applies to really all our verticals. Think about government, think about talent. If we're able -- they're under cost pressure today. And those verticals, whether you're a background screener or a government agency, improving your productivity and improving the speed of the service you deliver is very, very valuable to them. And the way to do that is to use instant data from Equifax like our twin data, our income and employment data. Q \u2013 Andrew Jeffrey : That's very helpful. Thanks. I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Please proceed with your questions. Q \u2013 Andrew Nicholas : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to first touch on a comment you made about a win for EWS and Verification Services within the U K, I believe. I wanted to ask, I think you said 40% of the private sector employee base, if I heard correctly, if you could clarify that. And then just curious, is that an exclusive relationship? And how important could that relationship be to getting a foothold or the pole position in the UK market, especially given a competitor of yours ambitions to build a similar business there? A \u2013 Mark Begor : Yeah. I think we've been quite clear that over the last couple of years, as we completed the cloud, we were looking for new international markets to take Workforce Solutions into. As we talked on the call earlier, we've been building out businesses in Australia and Canada, and then most recently, a year ago, really in the first quarter, we launched our UK business using our new cloud capabilities and started to go into the market and talk to both individual contributors and payroll processors around adding data records. So we've made some positive traction over the last, I guess, four years in Australia and four years in Canada and over the last 12 months in the UK. We're looking to continue to grow and expand our capabilities there. We had -- I don't know the number, but we've had a handful of agreements signed in the UK, and we also signed an agreement with an entity that has tax data that is a proxy for income and employment. So that's been a positive addition in the UK. That gives us a lot of coverage so we can start rolling out solutions there. In Australia, we've got -- had an agreement with a pension administrator that brought that kind of data in, which is -- and also has the equivalent of W-2 type data in it that's quite accretive also. So it's clearly part of our strategy to continue to build out and invest into international footprint for workforce. Q \u2013 Andrew Nicholas : Great. Thank you. And then for my follow-up, I just wanted to ask a question on margins. It looks like you're expecting 30% plus type margins exiting the year. Is there any reason not to believe that's a good starting point for 2024? And I know you're not going to give guidance for that year, but mostly asking about if there are kind of cost-saving actions that you expect to still be underway that late in the year or if that fourth quarter number is a decent run rate to think about kind of a stable base for out years? Thank you. A \u2013 John Gamble : Yeah. So I think as we talked about in the presentation, we're expecting in the fourth quarter to get to 36% EBITDA margins, driven by some recovery in revenue but also really significantly by the acceleration of the cost actions. And the cost actions have a continuing benefit in 2024. So we're expecting additional benefit from the cost actions as we go into 2024. And we're also expecting to get additional cost benefits as we continue to complete the cloud transformation beyond North America, and we'll start to start to see some of those benefits occur in 2024. So we think we still have tailwinds on the cost side that will benefit our margins as we get into 2024. And then obviously, as we get closer to 2024, we can start talking about revenue. But there certainly are cost tailwinds that continue out of 2023 and into 2024. Andrew Nicholas : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Hey, Mark, I want to ask you a little bit about the main functional areas for headcount reduction. And what I'm trying to focus on is NPI has been a big driver and driving particularly non-mortgage growth? And how do you make sure that you're going to not harm kind of the goose that's laying the golden eggs in terms of the ramp of revenue that we should expect over the next several years by reducing your headcount by 10%. And then I have a follow-up. Mark Begor : Yes. We're obviously quite thoughtful about that, as you might imagine, we want to make sure we're quite strategic about where we're doing it. Remember, the bulk of the actions are really related to the cloud transformation and accelerating those. So you've got a lot happening in technology. And the bulk of the actions are also in contractors. We hired a bunch of contractors to do the cloud work, and we're taking actions now when we complete that and decommission the legacy infrastructure to take those out. The rest of the actions, I would characterize as kind of normal focus and thoughtful focus around where do we have opportunities to be more efficient and more productive while protecting our focus on growth. And growth includes our new products. John Gamble : The only thing I'd add is as transformation completes the effort necessary to launch new products comes down substantially, right? It's one of the real benefits from cloud transformation that we've been talking about substantially. And as data is on fabric and everything is running through Ignite and InterConnect, then the level of investment necessary to launch those new products really starts to become something that we can do faster and cheaper. So as Mark said, we do a very good job of making sure we understand who is working on what. So as we reduce resource, we take it out of specifically transformation. But also as we go forward, we expect to get a lot of leverage in product launches in terms of being able to launch them faster and cheaper because they're on the transform cloud infrastructure. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. Thank you. And then\u2026 John Gamble : And we've seen that in EWS by the way. It isn't something that we haven't seen. It's already happened in EWS. Mark Begor : I think it's a great point, just to add on that. I think we mentioned on the call today that EWS new product rollouts, kind of 2x our long-term goal, north of 20% last year. And as you know, they were in the cloud a year ago, 18 months ago, and it's really shown what we envisioned happening, that the ability to bring more new solutions to market more quickly and more productively, as John pointed out, and efficiently would happen when you're cloud native. And that's part of what we expect to happen as we go through 2023, and we expect to continue in 2024, meaning we're going to have additional cloud benefits, as John pointed out in 2024, and then we get the full year run rate impact of our actions in 2023. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Got it, got it. And then just as a follow-up, I want to ask a little bit more about the competitive environment on The Work Number. You have a competitor in the market that's talking about signing more contracts with mortgage processors, and the vast majority of those are being -- putting them at the top of the waterfall. I'm just trying to square what they're talking about and some of the growth that they're trying -- they're communicating to the analyst community with kind of the market position and what you're seeing. I mean, are you seeing increased threats to your market position and the volumes that are coming through? Mark Begor : We're not. I'd clarify with them if you want to try to understand better the top of waterfall comment. We don't know where that is or how that happens. We haven't seen them as a competitive threat in the marketplace. I think as you know, our record additions are quite substantial. We're -- we added in the quarter more records -- more unique records than they have. So we've clearly got an ability to attract new partnerships and individual relationships given the scale of the company. And then on the commercial side, our integrations are so deep and so substantial, we haven't seen an impact from a revenue standpoint. As you can see, the numbers are super strong in Workforce Solutions across all of our verticals, including mortgage. Their outperformance is exceptionally strong and hasn't slowed down. A \u2013 John Gamble : And just please remember, our historical record base is incredibly valuable to our customers, certainly in Talent, certainly in Government, increasingly in mortgage, we talked about mortgage 36 on in the conference call. And that's a place where we have tremendous strength in general and Verification Services and an even stronger position in historical records. Q \u2013 Shlomo Rosenbaum : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions. Q \u2013 Toni Kaplan : Thanks so much. First, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the bearishness within the mortgage forecast. The 30% inquiries decline I think would imply that originations are even lower than that. And I think just -- I know sometimes the third-party forecasts are a little bit optimistic. But I just felt like there was a pretty big delta there. And so if you could just go into maybe why your mortgage forecast is so bearish? Thanks. A \u2013 Mark Begor : Yeah. It's -- first off, it's very difficult to forecast. And I think we've shown over the last year that it's a hard thing to do. We've been pretty good about forecasting inside of a quarter, meaning out for a couple of months because the trends are pretty clear on what we're seeing on a daily and weekly basis. But as you get out a couple of quarters in this uncertain environment, it's much more challenging. And John, correct me if I'm wrong, I believe for the last year we've had our outlooks south of the other forecasts, like MBA and stuff consistently. So that's not a new approach for us. And Toni, as you know, we have real visibility to originations that are actually happening on a near-term basis, which is what we try to factor into our forecast. And you could call it bearish or conservative or, in our case, we tried to put it the most realistic outlook in place, that's what we put out there. A \u2013 John Gamble : Just a reminder, EWS, which is the bulk of the mortgage business, right, their transactions tend to look a lot more like originations, right? USIS does have that shopping behavior, which is better. But EWS now it's really much closer to originations. It's a much better proxy. And so also, as we talked about, I mean, what we did is we looked at run rates and then it just assumed kind of normal seasonality. I think what you're hearing from some of the third-party forecasters is an expectation of some type of substantial recovery in the mortgage market. That could occur, and if it does, we'll benefit, okay? But right now, what we're assuming is we're going to see a market that looks a little more normal in terms of its seasonality versus this year, and we're going to wait to see that recovery before we start saying it's going to happen. Q \u2013 Toni Kaplan : Terrific. And I wanted to ask a little bit more broadly on consumer spending. When you think about your -- what are you seeing, I guess, in year-to-date trends and how are you expecting that to play out throughout the course of the year? Thanks. Mark Begor : Yes. Toni, really not a lot of change from the consumer from October, meaning they're still strong. They're working -- like unemployment being so low, unemployment being so high and all the open jobs, that's a good thing for the consumer. They've clearly -- we've seen they spent down some of their COVID pandemic savings, but there's still positive savings from where they were in 2019. So that element is quite positive. Obviously, at the low end, inflation is still pressuring the subprime consumer, and we've seen some uptick in delinquencies there. But broadly, we would characterize the consumer as being quite strong. Now when we look out for 2023 here in February, that's where we talked about and we factored into our outlook a more uncertain economy, which should impact the consumer, call it, in the second half perhaps in the way we're thinking about it with these continued rising interest rates. And every day, you see another company announcing layoffs or hiring freezes. And that's going to have to have an impact at some point, and that's part of our outlook. On the B2B side, I think we talked at length about what we're seeing in the hiring space that we've already -- I just talked about. But that's impacting our businesses in background screening and talent and then an I-9 and onboarding. We still expect to grow over 10% in those two businesses because of pricing and product and penetration. But the actual volume, we expect to be down on a year-over-year basis. So that's going to have an impact. Toni Kaplan : Perfect. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Seth Weber with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Seth Weber : Hey, guys. Good morning. Maybe for John, is there any way to quantify what the delta is from -- on the compensation side where you're going from below plan last year to plan this year? Is there any way to just quantify what that represents as a year-over-year change? Mark Begor : I think in the quarter, you talked about -- in the first quarter, if you exclude that in the equity impact, margins are basically flat. John Gamble : And just really the equity impact were pretty close to flat. So we didn't -- so we tend to try to list things in order of importance. So what you can take from the listing we gave is it's fairly substantial. No, we haven't quantified our -- the total incentive and sales incentive difference year-on-year. But we're saving -- the $120 million savings is obviously quite substantial. And the most substantial area we're offsetting is that change in overall sales compensation and incentive compensation as well as equity compensation. So it's the biggest factor. Also, we are seeing increases in royalty costs. It's both in mortgage. We talked about one of our mortgage vendors, increasing prices. We do get some benefit from that on the revenue side as a pass-through, but it also significantly increases our expenses. And then also as we continue to substantially grow in Workforce Solutions, our partners, which we had an outstanding year, growing 10 new exclusive partners for in the fourth quarter, we do see royalties go up. But EWS is able to outgrow that and drive their margins higher. So anyway, those are the biggest things that we're offsetting with the -- that are offsetting the $120 million in cost savings. Seth Weber : Got it. You actually anticipated my follow-up question. Just you mentioned this higher royalty and data costs to you. Is that kind of just a catch-up do you feel like, or is this more of the new normal going forward that these costs are going to be higher -- structurally higher going forward for you guys? A \u2013 John Gamble : So the specific comment around mortgage, I think that was probably -- there was a large increase from a vendor, and everyone knows that. So that was a onetime effect or we'll see what happens in the future. On EWS, we've seen an increase in their royalties over time as they continue to grow partner records, and that's just part of the business model. And we think they can deliver 50% plus margins even as that grows. So it's just -- it's a cost that we have to incur in the business, but it's an extremely beneficial cost because the variable margin on those -- on the revenue that those records generate continues to be high, but those costs are increasing. The other costs I didn't mention, right, that we're offsetting is we are continuing to see duplicate costs because we're continuing to run the major US systems in credit and the major Canadian systems in credit through the middle of this year or into the third quarter. And so that duplicate cost is something we're still incurring, and that's also something that's partially offsetting the cost savings we're generating. Q \u2013 Seth Weber : Got it. Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of David Togut with Evercore. Please proceed with your questions. Q \u2013 David Togut : Thank you. Good morning. Looking at Slide 13 with the $250 million total spending reduction for 2024, how much of that is a CapEx reduction versus OpEx? And then of those two numbers, particularly the OpEx reduction, how much will flow through to earnings versus being offset by additional expenses? A \u2013 John Gamble : So in terms of the split of capital and expense, we didn't give specifics, but it's probably reasonable just to use the same split that you have in 2023. And I think I'm going to have to ask you to wait until 2024 before we talk about -- we give -- we talk about 2024 guidance. But what we did talk about, right, is there's substantial expense savings that we expect to see not just from this but also from continuing to execute on our transformation. And we do expect our margins to grow, right? So we're going to get margin enhancement through revenue growth because it's obviously -- we have obviously a high -- very high variable margins as the mortgage market even just normalizes at these levels, our revenue growth starts to accelerate. And then also, we'll get cost savings. So how do you decide to decide what goes where? It's up to you. But we do expect to see margin enhancement with a better revenue growth environment and a more stable mortgage market. Q \u2013 David Togut : Got it. And just as a quick follow-up, if you could quantify the EWS price increase at the beginning of this year? A \u2013 Mark Begor : Yeah. I think you know, we don't -- for competitive reasons and commercial reasons, we don't talk about any price increases. I think we've been clear that we have more pricing leverage in EWS than our other businesses. We've also been clear that we generally do our price increases effective 1/1 and roll them out in the fall or fourth quarter to our customers. And so price for EWS, USIS, International, we got real clarity because it's in the marketplace and already negotiated with our customers. So that gives us a lot of confidence in that element of our margin and revenue levers for the year. Q \u2013 David Togut : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC. Please proceed with your questions. Q \u2013 John Mazzoni : Hi. This is John Mazzoni fill up for Ashish. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just building more on this new Equifax theme and in terms of the kind of restructuring efforts, could these tech layoffs benefit the company in terms of hiring engineering talent? Your comments suggest that kind of the white collar layoffs are really concentrated in that type of kind of high-growth, high-tech area and maybe that had to go into investor session could actually help you in-source tech talent. Any color there would be appreciated. Thanks. Mark Begor : Yes, I'm not sure I understand the question. Could you just clarify that? About -- tech is an important function for Equifax for sure. As you know, we're a data analytics technology company. It's actually our largest number of employees and, by far, the largest number of contractors. Most of the cost savings have always been planned, and that's what we're executing in 2023 come from completing the cloud and then exiting the plan -- the contractors that we're working on that are principally contractors and exiting those out. Go ahead. John Gamble : Were you asking if the tech layoffs by some other large tech companies may benefit us in hiring? John Mazzoni : Correct, yes. So if you could in-source those jobs that might have been done by contractors. Mark Begor : Yes. We're always looking to improve our talent and upgrade it. I think we've got a very strong technology team today, but for sure. Maybe I'll answer the question a little bit differently. If you asked the question a year ago about what's it like to hire tech talent a year ago, 18 months ago, 24 months ago, it was very hard. Today, when we're hiring tech talent, which we do all the time with -- in the environment as you described, where a lot of tech companies are pulling back, that is a positive for Equifax. We're able to get great talent and it's just shorter time frames between opening a job and finding great people to come onboard in this current environment. So for sure. John Mazzoni : Great. Very helpful. And then maybe just building a little bit on that question but in a different lens. Layoffs are broadening out across different industries that are non-tech in nature. Is any of that baked into the unemployment claims assumptions in 2023? And maybe due to the lag effect of severance, could there be a potential upside in the back half of the year as these unemployment claims could pick up? Mark Begor : I think you've seen before at Equifax, if you follow it closely, that in a rising unemployment environment like in 2020, we get substantial upside from our unemployment claims business. Today, we don't have that really baked in, in 2023 because we just haven't seen that yet. But if it comes forward, that will certainly be a positive. John Mazzoni : Great color. Thanks again. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions. George Tong : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. You provided assumptions for industry mortgage volumes for 2023. Can you discuss your expectations for card and auto origination volumes for this year as well? Mark Begor : Yes. We haven't disclosed those in the past, George. As you know, we've -- in the past, we've been very transparent around mortgage just because of the volatility, if you will, in that space and the impact it's had in Equifax. John Gamble : I think what we have talked about is we were seeing -- we saw a nice growth in card in the fourth quarter in terms of volumes, not just -- our revenue was very good in banking, but also we saw a nice growth in banking and volumes in general. So that trend continues to be positive. Auto was kind of flattish, right? We think we performed well because of product, pricing and some penetration gains. So we think we did very well in online auto. We didn't see substantial market growth in auto in terms of transactions in the fourth quarter. So -- and as Mark said, as we go through next year, we've assumed a general weakening of the economy relative to where we are today. George Tong : Got it. That's helpful. And related to the trends that you're seeing on the card side, can you discuss growth trends you're seeing with credit card marketing and prequalification volumes? A \u2013 Mark Begor : Yeah, that was fairly strong in 2022 and in the fourth quarter. And we would expect that to continue at a fairly strong level in certainly the first quarter, which we gave you guidance on. And I think in our broader guide for 2023, we expect kind of a broad softening in the economy in the second half, and that's factored into our outlook for the year. A \u2013 John Gamble : Just as a reminder, our Financial Marketing Services business was weak last year, right? And we talked about that throughout the year. And what we expect is we expect to see it kind of flatten out in 2023, part of it just because we're lapping a weak year and part of it because we think we're improving some of the product offerings we have. But -- so overall, for us, our Financial Marketing Services business was generally not strong in 2022, but we're expecting a little better performance and some growth in 2023. Q \u2013 George Tong : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions. Q \u2013 Surinder Thind : Thank you. Hi, Mark, just following up on the questions from the last analyst. Just big picture-wise, I mean, does the relative strength of kind of what you're seeing in like auto card, P loans, at this point in the economic cycle both from like a marketing spend perspective and as well as volumes, does that kind of surprise you at this point? And maybe how should we generally think about the cyclicality of the business? I mean, if the economy was to maybe fall into a recession late 2023, is that when we would maybe expect to see lenders pull back a bit more? Just trying to gauge if there's structurally anything different that we should be thinking about this time around? A \u2013 Mark Begor : I think this is a different economic event than we've ever seen before, right? You've got interest rates increasing rapidly. You've got inflation at a level that it hasn't been in 40 years, but you also have people working. That usually doesn't tie together. Normally, you see unemployment increase as there's an economic event. And I think the real question is that -- I'm not an economist, but the real question is that -- is there going to be the so-called soft landing with interest rates and inflation? With the labor report from last Friday, it doesn't feel like that, meaning there's going to be continued interest rate increases to try to tame inflation. But the variable on all the verticals you described in financial services, where financial services companies, I ran a credit card company for a decade, where a credit card company or a financial service company will start tightening up is when people aren't working. And when they're not working, they can't pay their bills or they slow down their payment of their bills. So that's the dichotomy that we have in 2022 and I call it the early parts of 2023, is you've got an economy that clearly is seeing pressure. You've got companies that are tightening their belts, which is impacting some of our B2B volume. But you got a consumer that's still fairly healthy. Their consumer confidence is down, but they're working so they're still paying their bills. Our assumption for 2023 is that doesn't continue, meaning there's some weakening of that in the second half is kind of how we laid it out. And then, of course, on top of that, we're disproportionately impacted versus some of our peers by the massive mortgage market decline that we've had. We've been living in a mortgage recession for six-plus months, and we've got another six months until we get the first half strength of 2023 behind us. But last year, the mortgage market decline impacted us -- just the market impact of that was close to $0.5 billion, a little over $0.5 billion. So we've been living in a usual economic environment. And from our perspective, quite positively, Equifax has continued to grow through that. John Gamble : And just as a reminder, as you think about USIS, right, two of the areas that are performing extremely well that are driving a lot of our growth are commercial and identity and fraud, right? So segments that are not necessarily embedded within the consumer, but where we think we have differentiated capabilities and benefits that should allow us to grow nicely in markets that may even weaken. Surinder Thind : Thank you. That was my question. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Heather Balsky with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions. Heather Balsky : Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I'd love to ask about the -- on workforce, the non-mortgage verification side of things and how you're thinking about those businesses into the year, especially given sort of the macro backdrop that you're layering into your guidance and both on the Talent and Government side, how you see those businesses shaking out? Mark Begor : Yes. I think we talked about that, and John can jump in. But we expect those businesses to still perform very well. Remember, the underlying levers that verification has, it starts with records. So our 12% increase in records last year benefits 2023. And then we've got 10 new processors that we're going to be adding records in 20 -- during this year in 2023. So records were positive in all the different verticals that we sell into, whether it's government, talent, auto, cards, P loans, the non-mortgage verticals in verification. We've got price increases in the marketplace. We're rolling out new products in every one of those verticals that really benefit growth going forward. So that's a positive. And then just underlying penetration. Remember in every one of those non-mortgage verticals for verification, we have fairly low penetration in cards, in auto, there's a lot of penetration opportunity. P loans is pretty high. Like mortgage, we do a lot -- we have -- we cover a lot of the ground in P loans. But then you go into talent and government, there's just a lot of market penetration opportunities. So then the flip side of that is the underlying market for those. What's happening to the economic impacts in there? And the one place that we've highlighted is talent and around verification where there is some reduction in hiring, but we said that we expect that business to still be up over 10% for 2023. Government is also a vertical that if there is an economic event, there's going to be more people going for social services, which will be a positive for that vertical. We expect that to grow positively through 2023. John Gamble : Yes. And just as a reminder, and Mark already mentioned that we're expecting total non-mortgage for EWS next year about 13%. So still very, very good and that even reflects weakness that we're going to see in ERC, right? ERC was very strong. And now with the end of that program, that pandemic-based program, you'll see a significant reduction there, which is non-mortgage, and we'll still grow 13% through that, so. Heather Balsky : Great. Thank you. And on -- in terms of your sort of overall non-mortgage business, so you talked about the fact that you're assuming a weakening economy in the back half. Can you just help us -- I know you don't necessarily guide the individual quarters, but how to think about the cadence from 1Q to 2Q and then into the back half? And just sort of what's baked into your outlook. A \u2013 Mark Begor : It's tricky to do without getting into the quarter. I think we've given you an outlook for the year and an outlook for the first quarter and then -- which we don't typically do. We also gave you some visibility around what we expect margins to do because of the unusual -- the acceleration of the cloud cost savings and the broader restructuring of the company, that kind of 30% to 36% EBITDA margins gives you a lot of visibility around the profitability side. What else would you add, John? A \u2013 John Gamble : I think it's about all we can add, right? So I mean, we gave fairly good visibility on how we expect margins to substantially enhance through the year, going from about 30-ish, right, to 36% by the end of the year. And we said we'll start seeing those cost savings really kick in, in the second quarter. So beyond that, not much more to say. Q \u2013 Heather Balsky : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions. Q \u2013 Faiza Alwy : Yes. Hi, thank you. First, I just wanted to follow up on the USIS B2B online growth that looks like it accelerated in 4Q. I'm curious how you expect that business to trend in 2023. Like was there something specific that drove the acceleration, or was it just a matter of comps? And maybe if you can comment on what type of pricing benefit you expect to see in that business in 2023? A \u2013 John Gamble : Yeah. So what we -- what Mark mentioned is that the way the planning was built is we assumed about a 5% non-mortgage growth. And overall, you were referring to acceleration in online, right? I'm referring to overall non-mortgage growth of about 5%, which is a little lower than it was in the fourth quarter but still very, very strong. And I think the decline from the fourth quarter is principally driven by the fact that we've assumed that we're going to see weakening economic conditions as we move through the year, right? And I think what we're doing is just reflecting that in the 2023 guidance we provided. So we think that 5% growth with a US economy that weakens through the year, we think is a very nice outcome, and it shows very good performance and continued good performance across banking across auto, across other verticals and then also a return to some level of growth -- not high, but some level of growth in our Financial Marketing Services business. Q \u2013 Faiza Alwy : Okay. I guess is the cycle price increase that you mentioned, is that primarily in mortgage, or is that you think going to positively impact the B2B online business, the nonmortgage business as well? A \u2013 Mark Begor : Yeah, we take price up generally in all our products every year, varying amounts dependent upon our market position and our commercial position, et cetera. A \u2013 John Gamble : Yeah. Mortgage has a very defined price change. On January 1, it's pretty much industry wide, right? So across other verticals, generally speaking, price increases do happen early in the year but that isn't always the case, right? So they tend to be more distributed throughout the year. So it isn't as unified an event outside of mortgage. But yes, we do expect to continue to get price. We certainly had a price benefit in the fourth quarter, and we expect to continue to have price benefits as we move through 2023. Q \u2013 Faiza Alwy : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Andy Grobler with BNP Paribas. Please proceed with your questions. Andy Grobler : Hi. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Firstly, just one on the compensation. Just to clarify, you've noted that it's going to come back in 2023 relative to 2022. Where would that stand versus 2021? In other words, it was just 2022 kind of artificially are unusually low, and we're going back to a more normal level now? Mark Begor : Yes. I think that's the right way to think about it. In 2022, we set out a plan for the year at this time last year, where we didn't anticipate a mortgage market change or interest rates going up or inflation where it was. And we missed that plan. And the way our compensation structures are aligned, as you might imagine, are tied to the performance against our plan for the year, and we underperformed that. So our compensation was substantially down in 2022. In 2023, we're assuming we get back to target levels, which would be more like 21%. John Gamble : 2021 was a very good year, right? So our comp was strong in 2021 because 2021 was a strong year overall. Andy Grobler : Yes. Yes. And just to kind of follow-up on the costs and so forth. You had cost savings plans from the cloud transformation baked into expectations anyway. And now you've talked about the $120 million of savings next year. What is the increment versus your previous expectations within the $120 million? Mark Begor : Yes. You said the $120 million next year, it's actually this year, which I think you meant is 2023. Andy Grobler : Yes, this year, sorry. Mark Begor : Yes. And we didn't break that out for you, but the $120 million is a combination of accelerating some of the cloud cost savings that we had planned. So the -- I think we said in the call earlier, no change in what we expected to deliver from the cloud savings. We're accelerating some of that into 2023. We also said we expect additional cloud cost savings in 2024 and likely some in 2025. And then on top of that, in 2023, inside the $120 million is at a broader restructuring and efficiencies across the company to deliver additional cost savings that are incremental our long-term cloud savings that we've talked about for the last couple of years. Andy Grobler : I suppose that's the question. In terms of your incremental savings on that longer-term plan. How much is baked into this year's guide? Mark Begor : Yes. We haven't broken that out as a part of our conversation this morning. We really just highlighted that, obviously, it's a sizable number. It's going to have a very positive impact on the company, and its -- there's an incremental piece to the accelerated cloud savings. Andy Grobler : Okay. Thank you. And if I may, just one more. Just from the EWS perspective, when you're having discussions with clients and data providers, now that there is a fairly determined competitor in play, are those conversations changing at all? Mark Begor : They're not. We still have a very effective ability to add new relationships. I think we talked about adding 10 that will come online this year during 2023. And we have the scale of workforce solutions, the scale of their technology, the scale of our security and capabilities and the longevity we've had in the business. So we've been in this business for over a decade, and then the ability to deliver a rev share immediately at scale for those records from a partner gives us a lot of power to continue to grow our record base. And there's a long runway in front of us of records that we'll be adding to the TWN data set. Andy Grobler : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to hand the call back over to Trevor Burns for any closing comments. Trevor Burns : Thanks for everybody's time today. And if you have any questions, you can reach out to me and Sam. We'll be around, and have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference.

Mark Begor : Thanks, Trevor, and good morning. Equifax delivered another strong quarter with 10% constant currency non-mortgage revenue growth as we executed well against our Equifax 2025 strategic priorities and the $200 million spending plan we announced in February. Before I cover our strong results for the quarter, I want to provide a brief overview of what we're seeing in the U.S. economy and U.S. consumer. We continue to navigate a higher interest rate environment that has severely impacted the U.S. mortgage market. Mortgage originations were down 56% in 2022, and we expect them to be down about 32% this year. In the second half, we expect mortgage inquiries to be approaching an unprecedented 40% below 2015 to 2019 levels. The combined market impact in 2022 and 2023 is expected to reduce Equifax revenue by over $900 million, but the breadth and depth of the Equifax business model and fast growing non-mortgage businesses allowed Equifax to deliver 20% non-mortgage constant dollar growth last year, and 4% total growth last year, and an expectation to deliver 8% non-mortgage and 4% total growth in 2023 at the mid-point of our guidance, more than offsetting the large negative impact from the unprecedented mortgage market decline. Broadly, consumers are still strong with unemployment at historically low levels and with modest increases in delinquencies. We're seeing some credit card and personal loan delinquency increases in subprime and more broadly DQs are now back to pre-pandemic levels, although they remain significantly below the levels we saw in 2009 and 2010. Auto loan delinquency rates for subprime consumers are above pre-pandemic levels as well as above the levels we saw in 2009 and 2010. And as you know, delinquencies generally are manageable when people are working. While we have seen limited pockets of DQ increases, we continue to watch this important metric as we move through the rest of the year. Historically, as DQs increase, our customers will begin to reduce marketing and tighten originations. Gross hiring year-to-date through February was down about 6% slightly better than the trends we saw in the fourth quarter, and inflation remains at elevated levels, but has begun to moderate slightly given Fed actions but with inflation still well above Fed targets, we expect further rate increases. And we believe there has been some credit tightening at some customers with more impact in FinTech from both expectations of a slowing economy in the second half and capital issues impacting certain banks. And as you recall, our guidance assumed a slowdown in the second half. While we are operating in an uncertain and challenging economic environment, Equifax continues to deliver. The breadth and depth of Equifax's broad-based business model is allowing us to weather this, the unprecedented mortgage market decline and deliver revenue growth and margin expansion. Turning to Slide 4. Equifax had another strong quarter with non-mortgage constant dollar revenue growth up 10%. First quarter reported revenue of $1.302 billion was down 4.5% and down 4.3% on an organic constant currency basis and above our expectations against an unprecedented 58% mortgage market decline in the quarter. Revenue was above the high-end of our February guidance from broad-based strength and execution across Equifax and continued strong new product rollouts. First quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $380 million with adjusted EBITDA margins of 29.2% both in line with our expectations. Adjusting for the incremental stock-based compensation expense incurred in the quarter adjusted EBITDA margins would've been approximately 31%, which is the baseline of which we expect to grow to 36% in the fourth quarter from revenue growth and our $120 million cost savings plan. As a reminder, the bulk of the spending reduction benefit the second half and we have $50 million of carryover benefit in 2024 from our actions this year. Adjusted EPS of $1.43 per share was above our February guidance range of $1.30 or $1.40 per share from stronger than expected revenue growth. Our Equifax non-mortgage businesses, which represented about 80% of total revenue in the quarter, were strong with 10% constant currency and 8% organic constant currency revenue growth, with the 10% growth solidly inside our 8% to 12% long-term growth framework. All BUs delivered stronger than expected non-mortgage growth, which is positive momentum for the rest of the year. Estimated U.S. mortgage market originations, which MBA forecasted to be down about 58% in the quarter were slightly weaker than the down 55% in our February framework. Total U.S. mortgage revenue was down about 33% or 25 points better than the market with both total revenue and our mortgage outperformance stronger than we outlined in February. The stronger outperformance was driven by better U.S. credit inquiries from higher than expected consumer shopping and positive mix in workforce solutions driven by significant growth from our new mortgage 36 trended product. We continue to make significant progress driving completion of the Equifax data and technology transformation. At the end of the quarter, over 70% of Equifax is being delivered from the new Equifax Cloud, which will expand to 80% by year-end as we substantially complete the North America customer migrations to the Equifax Cloud. Our new Equifax Cloud infrastructure is delivering always on capabilities and faster new product innovation with integrated datasets, faster data delivery, better data quality, and industry-leading enterprise level security. We continue to be convinced that our Equifax Cloud and Single Data Fabric will provide a competitive advantage to Equifax for years to come. New product innovation leveraging the capabilities delivered by the Equifax Cloud is also executing at a very high-level. Our new product Vitality Index of 13% in the quarter is at record levels and 300 basis points above our 10% long-term vitality goal. And as you recall, in February, we reached the definitive agreement to acquire Boa Vista Servi\u00e7os, the second largest credit bureau in Brazil. When completed, the BVS acquisition will add $160 million of run rate revenue in the fast growing Brazilian market. The transaction is subject to Boa Vista shareholder approval and other customary closings conditions, and we expect the transaction to close in the third quarter. As we outlined in February, we're executing a broad operational restructuring across Equifax, reflecting both the acceleration of our cloud transformation benefits and a broader focus on operational improvements aided by our new cloud capabilities. The plan will reduce our total workforce of over 23,500 employees and contractors by over 10% during 2023, as well as delivering cost reductions from the closure of major North American data centers and other broader spending controls. Total spending reductions from these 2023 actions are expected to be about $200 million with about $120 million reduction in expense or about $0.75 per share and $80 million reduction in capital spending. And we're tracking well to the plans we laid out in February, and we remain committed to meeting these cost improvement targets. In 2024, the run rate benefit of these actions will reduce spending by an incremental $50 million to over $250 million. And we're maintaining our 2023 full-year revenue guidance of $5.275 billion to $5.375 billion, and adjusted EPS guidance of $7.05 per share to $7.35 per share. Our guidance continues to assume a weakening U.S. and global economy in the second half. Given the slightly weaker U.S. mortgage market that we saw principally in March, we are now assuming U.S. mortgage market inquiries for 2023 to be down about 32% or 200 basis points weaker than we discussed in February. Given our strong and broad-based performance in the first quarter, our ability to continue to outperform underlying markets and execution on our plan 2023 spending reductions, we are reaffirming our 2023 guidance in a continued challenging mortgage market and expected slowing economy in the second half. We also continue to expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA margins of over 36% in the fourth quarter, which is a very important stepping off point for 2024. John will provide more detail on the overall mortgage market and our second quarter and full-year guidance shortly. Turning to Slide 5. In the first quarter, we continued our strong non-mortgage revenue performance delivering 10% constant dollar and 8% organic constant currency revenue growth. All three business units delivered strong non-mortgage revenue growth in the quarter with workforce up 11%, international up 10% in constant currency, and USIS up 8%. This broad-based non-mortgage growth across the business units will be increasingly supported by completion of the Equifax Cloud and continued NPI growth across the businesses. First quarter constant dollar non-mortgage growth of 10% was well within our 8% to 12% long-term revenue framework despite some slowdown in U.S. hiring activity that impacted EWS' Talent Solutions and I-9 businesses, as well as the comparison off a very strong 25% non-mortgage constant dollar revenue growth in first quarter last year. Turning to Slide 6. Workforce Solutions delivered another very strong quarter with non-mortgage revenue growth up 11% and total revenue down 8% as expected from the 58% mortgage market decline. EWS had another strong quarter of record additions with an incremental 4 million records added to the TWN database ending the quarter with 156 million current records, up 15% and 117 million unique records, which was up 12%. This is a very positive sign, has historically the first quarter has lower net record growth as large retail and logistics companies reduce elevated holiday season staffing in the first quarter. And as a reminder, unique records represent individuals on the TWN database and current records represent current active jobs in the database. And in our case, we have almost 50 million individuals having more than one job in our dataset. 117 million unique individuals on TWN deliver high hit rates, including self-employed or 1099 employees and defined benefit pensioners we now cover just over 50% of the 220 million people in the U.S. with employment and income records that are relevant to TWN database and our customers. As I referenced last quarter, we're also beginning to onboard pension records with records from one major pension administrator and discussions with many more. And through our cloud tech transformation, we're executing -- expanding our capabilities to ingest unique 1099 based self-employment records. And as a reminder, about 50% of our records are contributed directly by individual employers from our employer services business relationships. The remaining are contributed through partnerships principally with payroll companies. And during the quarter, we signed agreements with three new payroll processors that will deliver records during the balance of 2023. And the TWN U.S. database now has 618 million total current and historical records from over 2.7 million employers. Increasingly, more of our new products are incorporated current and historical records with about 50% of first quarter verification services revenue coming from products that include historical or trended records. Mortgage revenue was down 38% in the quarter, which was in line with our February guidance, but outperformed the overall mortgage market by 20 points when compared to the 58% decline in originations. These are very strong results when compared to EWS' 52% outperformance in the first quarter last year. In addition to strong record growth and the positive impact from price actions in the quarter, we also saw strong NPI performance driven by the adoption of our new mortgage 36 solution, which is a 36-month trended product. During the quarter, over 50% of TWN mortgage inquiries were for products including trended or historical information and all at higher price points. Turning to Slide 7. Workforce delivered revenue of $596 million, down 8% and in line with our expectations. Verification Services revenue of $456 million was down 11%, driven by the decline in mortgage revenue that I just referenced. Verification Services non-mortgage revenue, which now represents about two-thirds of Verifier revenue delivered strong 16% growth in the quarter. We saw continued very strong growth in the government vertical, which is about 45% of Verifier non-mortgage revenue, with revenue up 33% driven by strong growth with CMS at the state level, new products, and record additions. We expect this strong growth in our government vertical to continue throughout the year. Talent Solutions delivered strong 10% growth in the quarter despite the 6% decline in the overall hiring market. Talent Solutions volumes have remained consistent since the middle of the fourth quarter despite the declining hiring market. We outgrew the market decline by over 15 percentage points delivering 10% growth a very strong performance driven by continued penetration of our digital solutions and background screening, strong new product growth, continued expansion of TWN records and favorable pricing. In the quarter, we launched new products targeted to staffing and hourly segments, designed to meet specific needs of background screeners and end market employers in these very high volume market segments. We're also seeing continued penetration of our new educational background solutions. We expect these new products to continue to drive talent growth throughout 2023. Consumer lending was down 1% in the quarter due to lower auto volumes with financial institutions and P loan declines with FinTech lenders. Employer Services revenue of $141 million was up 4% from growth in our I-9 and onboarding businesses despite the negative impact in U.S. hiring offset by a 9% decline in UC or unemployment claims driven by lower jobless claims. Despite the slowdown in hiring, we've not seen an increase in UC transactions yet. And as a reminder, first quarter Employer Services revenues are seasonally higher than other quarters due to higher Affordable Care Act and W2 volumes. Last month, Workforce Solutions launched the PeopleHQ portal, a new cloud native solution that brings together multiple best-in-class employer compliance services in a single unified online experience. PeopleHQ serves employers of all sizes and supports the total employee journey with enhance and connected people first experience leveraging the full suite of EWS Employer Solutions, powered by the Equifax Cloud and leveraging industry-leading security measures the PeopleHQ portal will have several EWS services including the work number verification service I-9 HQ, including I-9 Anywhere and I-9 Inspect and ACA HQ with best-in-class Affordable Care Act capabilities that help employers meet the needs of their employees while also reducing risk for penalties. PeopleHQ is another example of how EWS is leveraging our new cloud native capabilities to deliver new solutions to the market that will drive employer revenue and continued direct record growth. Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margins of 50.4% were up 370 basis points from the fourth quarter and in line with our February guidance and as expected above 50% due to first quarter record growth, new product introductions and pricing actions, more than offsetting the macro effect of lower volumes in mortgage and Talent Solutions, as well as the negative mix from seasonally higher Employer Services revenues. The strength of EWS and uniqueness and value of their TWN income and employment data in Employer Services businesses were clear again in the quarter. Rudy and the EWS team delivered another strong quarter outperforming the mortgage and hiring markets and continued strong record growth that will drive revenue and margins in the future. Turning to Slide 8. USIS revenue of $422 million was down about 2.5% and much better than our expectations due to stronger mortgage and non-mortgage performance. USIS mortgage revenue was down 25% and was better than our expectations. Although estimated mortgage originations were 300 basis points weaker than our expectation at down an estimated 58%, USIS credit inquiries were stronger than we expected at down 44%. Credit inquiry performance continues to outperform originations, reflecting higher relative levels of consumer mortgage shopping behavior in this higher interest rate environment. Revenue outperformance relative to credit inquiries was strong at 19%, driven principally by pricing actions and was also strong versus a net estimated originations at 33%. At $105 million, our mortgage revenue was about 25% of total USIS revenue in the quarter. Total non-mortgage revenue of $317 million was up 8% in the quarter with organic growth of about 4%. The 8% growth was stronger than the mid-single-digit growth that we expected in our February guidance. B2B non-mortgage revenue of $261 million, which represented over 60% of total USIS revenue was up 8% with organic revenue growth of about 3%. B2B non-mortgage online revenue growth was up 9% total and up over 3% organically. And during the quarter, online revenue had very strong double-digit growth in commercial, auto, identity and fraud, and insurance. And banking was up slightly in the quarter with growth at large financial institutions, although at slower pace than in the fourth quarter more than offset by declines in -- with smaller financial institutions and FinTechs. Commercial was up over 20% with continued strong growth from our differentiated commercial credit data, including financial, telco, utility, and industry trade lines and our new OneScore for commercial that we launched in the first quarter. Commercial is an increasing area of strength delivering above market growth in the risk segment and we should see continued strong performance as we complete their data and cloud transformation later this year. Financial Marketing Services our B2B offline business returned to growth with revenue of $48 million was up 4%, and in line with our expectations. Revenue growth in offline fraud insights and IXI wealth products was partially offset by lower pre-screen marketing revenue. Pre-screen revenue from larger customers slowed growth in the quarter, but we saw a significant weakness from smaller FIs and FinTechs. And we have not seen an increase in risk-based portfolio reviews yet. USIS Consumer Solutions business had revenue of $56 million in first quarter, up 8% from very good performances in our consumer direct and indirect channels. USIS is winning in the marketplace with strong momentum from new solutions and differentiated data in key verticals of identity and fraud, commercial and auto. We're also in active dialogues with U.S. customers about the competitive benefits of the Equifax Cloud with always on stability, faster data transmission, and Equifax Cloud enabled new solutions. USIS is on offense as they finalize their cloud transformation and are pivoting to selling cloud enabled -- new cloud enabled solutions. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 32.6% in the quarter and in line with our expectations. EBITDA margins were down sequentially due to negative mix from seasonally sequential growth in mortgage solutions, which drives higher royalties and data costs, as well as the normalization of annual employee incentive costs. USIS is also incurring incremental costs from customer migrations to the new Equifax cloud that are accelerating as we move through 2023. We expect USIS adjusted EBITDA margins to be about 34% in the second quarter up sequentially reflecting revenue growth and the accelerating benefit of our 2023 spending reduction plan. Last month we announced Todd Horvath joined Equifax as our USIS President. Todd has a proven track record of leading enterprise teams and financial services to drive growth and strong commercial relationship. And he brings more than 20 years of financial services management experience, a commitment to driving product and operational excellence and strong expertise in enterprise and cloud technologies to his role as the USIS President. I'm energized to welcome Todd to the Equifax leadership team and believe that his experience in transformation, innovation, and customer experience will proven valuable to taking USIS to the next year. Turning to Slide 9. International revenue was $284 million in the quarter, up 9% in constant currency and 8% organically and much better than our expectations from new products and pricing actions. We're seeing a broad-based execution from Lisa and our international team. Europe local currency revenue was down 4%, but stronger than expected. The decline was due to the expected 20% decline in our debt management business in the UK. As we discussed last year, our UK debt management business was very strong in the first half of 2022, as the UK government made large catch-up debt placements following their COVID debt collection moratoriums. As a result, we expect to see declines in that business in the first half of 2022. However, we do expect to see consistent sequential growth in our debt management business as we move through 2023. In the quarter, we secured an expanded budget allocation from the UK government, which will deliver higher volumes of debt placements during the year, and we expect debt management to return to revenue growth later this year. Our UK and Spain CRA business revenue was up 7% in the quarter, a very good performance and stronger than we expected. This strong performance was principally due to strong growth from consumer decisioning and analytical solutions. Asia-Pacific delivered very strong local currency revenue growth of 11% in which Australia delivered high-single-digit growth in the quarter. We also saw a very strong growth in our India business up over 40%. Latin America local currency revenue was up a very strong 32% driven by very strong double-digit growth in Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Central America from new product introductions and pricing actions. This is the eighth consecutive quarter of strong double-digit growth for the Latin American team, which we expect to continue in 2023. Canada local currency revenue was up 8% and above our expectations. Growth in consumer and identity and fraud was offset partially by lower mortgage volumes in Canada. And international adjusted EBITDA margins at 23.5% were better than our expectations due to the stronger revenue growth and good execution against their 2023 cost reduction plans. Turning to Slide 10. New product introductions leveraging our differentiated data in the new Equifax Cloud are central to our EFX 2025 growth strategy. Building off the momentum from 2022 where we launched over 100 new products and delivered a record Vitality Index of over 13%. In the first quarter, we launched over 30 new products and delivered 13% Vitality again. Our first quarter Vitality Index was again led by very strong performance in Workforce Solutions and in Latin America. And in the quarter, over 80% of new product revenue came from non-mortgage products leveraging the new Equifax Cloud. Leveraging our new Equifax Cloud capabilities to drive new product rollouts, we expect to deliver Vitality Index in 2023 at about 13%, which is well above our 10% long-term Vitality Index goal. This equates to over $700 million of revenue from new products introduced in the past three years during 2023. New products leveraging our differentiated data, our new Equifax Cloud capabilities and Single Data Fabric are central to our long-term growth framework and are driving Equifax top-line growth and margins. On the right side of the slide, we've highlighted several new products introduced in the quarter. Leveraging our differentiated data, USIS launched OneScore, a new consumer credit scoring model that combines traditional Equifax credit history with telecommunications, payTV, and utility payment data on over 191 million consumers, as well as Equifax DataX and Teletrack specialty finance data on about 80 million consumers, including payment history from non-traditional banks and lenders, which will potentially increase credit scores by up to 25 points in the scorable population by more than 20%. These new solutions are testament to the power of the Equifax Cloud in driving innovation that can increase the visibility of consumers to help expand access to credit and create new mainstream financial opportunities for them. Now, I'd like to turn over to John to provide more detail on our second quarter guidance. We're up to a strong start in 2023, building off the momentum from a strong 2022 non-mortgage growth from new products, record growth and pricing. John? John Gamble : Thanks, Mark. Before I discuss 2023, I'll share a little more detail on first quarter 2023. First quarter corporate expense at $146 million was above our expectations, principally due to higher variable compensation with our strong first quarter results and cost related to executing the broader restructuring related to the $200 million spending reduction program. Items below operating income came in as we expected with interest expense of $58 million, depreciation and amortization, excluding acquisition-related amortization of $89 million, and a tax rate of about 26.1%. Capital spending in the quarter was about $154 million and in line with our expectations. We expect capital spending in the second quarter to remain at level similar to 1Q 2023 and then sequentially decline in the third and fourth quarters as we complete significant U.S. and Canadian customer migrations to data fabric. Total capital spending in 2023 is expected to be $545 million. CapEx as a percent of revenue will continue to decline in 2024 and thereafter, as we progress toward reaching 7% of revenue or below. As Mark mentioned, first quarter mortgage market originations were estimated by MBA at down almost 58%, which is about 300 basis points weaker than the down 55% for the first quarter that we discussed in February. As shown on Slide 11, however, first quarter credit inquiries were down 44% better than our February expectations. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate did decline from a high of 6.5% in the quarter to about 6.3% today. It appears the somewhat lower rates attracted people to begin the home buying process, but continued tight inventory and high home prices, limited closings and originations. As we look for the rest of 2023, our planning does not assume a fundamental improvement in the mortgage or housing markets. We're applying normal seasonal patterns to the current run rate of credit and TWN inquiries that we are seeing in late March and early April. On that basis for 2023, we are expecting mortgage market originations to decline about 32% versus 2022 or about a 200 basis point greater decline than we discussed in February. As we have discussed in the past, TWN inquiries are closely linked to originations. USIS credit inquiries despite the weaker overall originations market should still be down about 30% versus 2022 due to the better than expected credit inquiries in the first quarter and the expectation of continued greater than normal mortgage shopping that does not move to an origination. Looking at the second quarter, again applying seasonal patterns to the run rates we're seeing in late March and early April, mortgage market originations are assumed to be down about 38% and credit inquiries down about 33%. As we discussed in February sequentially as we move through the second half of 2023, a more normal pattern of mortgage activity would have mortgage originations in 3Q 2023 being about flat with 2Q 2023, and then declining in 4Q 2023 versus 3Q 2023. We expect that with these sequential patterns and the weaker overall originations in 2023 than we discussed in February, U.S. mortgage originations would be down slightly in the second half versus the first half and 4Q 2023 would be about flat year-to-year. Turning to Slide 12. As Mark referenced earlier, in the first quarter, we outperformed on revenue delivery and delivered well against our 2023 spending reduction plan that will deliver $200 million in spending reduction in 2023 versus 2022 levels, including workforce reduction, closure of data centers, and additional cost control measures. In the first quarter, adjusted EBITDA margins were slightly stronger than expected at 29.2%, adjusted for the negative timing of the impact higher stock-based compensation in the quarter versus fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA margins would've been about 31%. For 2Q, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins of approaching 32.5% at the mid-point of our guidance range. This sequential margin expansion is driven by both revenue growth as well as acceleration of the savings in the second half of 2023 related to our $200 million spending reduction plan. As revenue growth sequentially in the second half of 2023 and cloud and broader cost reductions accelerate EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS improve sequentially with EBITDA margins expected to exceed 36% and adjusted EPS exceeding $2 per share in the fourth quarter. Slide 13 provides our guidance for the second quarter of 2023. In 2Q 2023, we expect total Equifax revenue to be between $1.31 billion and $1.33 billion, with non-mortgage constant currency revenue growth of 7% to 8% partially offset by mortgage revenue declines moderating to about down 14%, compared to down 33% in the first quarter. FX is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by just over 100 basis points. 2Q 2023 adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to approach 32.5% up over 300 basis points sequentially given revenue growth, the 2023 cost actions and lower equity compensation expense. Overall, BU EBITDA margins in total are expected to be up sequentially from 1Q 2023 driven by workforce delivering adjusted EBITDA margins of over 51% in the quarter, as well as margin improvement in USIS from revenue growth and cost actions. Corporate expenses will decrease meaningfully, sequentially in 2Q 2023 as the equity compensation was principally reflected in the first quarter. Business unit performance in the second quarter expected to be as described below. Workforce Solutions revenue growth is expected to be down about 1%, negatively impacted by the expected about 38% decline in mortgage market originations. Non-mortgage revenue will be up high-single-digits, overcoming year-over-year declines in U.S. hiring and customer specific weakness in consumer lending. We expect EWS non-mortgage growth to reaccelerate to double-digits in the third and fourth quarters. EBITDA margins are expected to be up over -- are expected to be over 51%, up over 100 basis points sequentially driven by sequential revenue growth and strong execution of 2023 cost actions. Workforce Solutions will represent just under 50% of Equifax revenue in the quarter. USIS revenue is expected to be up about 3% year-to-year. Non-mortgage revenue growth should be approximately at the level similar to the 8% we delivered in the first quarter, partially offset by a decline in mortgage revenue due to the expected 33% decline in mortgage credit inquiries. EBITDA margins are expected to be about 34%, up sequentially due to revenue growth and strong execution on cost actions. International revenue is expected to be up about 6% in constant currency with EBITDA margins expected to be about 23%. Non-mortgage constant currency growth of 7% to 8% is down from the 10% we delivered in the first quarter. We do expect to return to 10% plus growth in 3Q and 4Q, principally driven by accelerating growth in EWS as well as stronger growth in international. We're expecting adjusted EPS in 2Q 2023 to be $1.60 to $1.70 per share. Slide 14 provides the specifics of our 2023 full-year guidance. As Mark mentioned, we are maintaining our full-year guidance despite the expected weaker U.S. mortgage originations and a more negative impact of foreign exchange. We expect total mortgage revenue to be down year-to-year at similar levels to our February guidance at down 8% or slightly more negative. As we discussed, we expect mortgage originations will be down 32% versus the down 30% we discussed in February. We do not expect this to impact USIS mortgage revenue, as we are seeing higher levels of shopping, which offset the decline in originations. In EWS, we expect an improved mix of higher value trended mortgage solutions to partially mitigate the impact of the originations decline. For non-mortgage constant currency revenue, we continue to expect constant currency growth at about the levels we discussed in February at up 8% or slightly better given our strong performance in NPI and stronger growth in international. These levels of growth, the strong start we had to the year, execution in NPI, delivery of our 2023 spending reductions in cloud transformation plan, allow us to deliver to our guidance despite the more negative impact of FX. We believe that our full-year guidance is centered at the mid-point of both our revenue and adjusted EPS ranges. As we discussed in February, we remain focused on delivering our mid-term goal of $7 billion in revenue and 39% EBITDA margins, market conditions are significantly different than we first discussed in November of 2021, our goal of achieving these goals in 2025. The U.S. mortgage market is expected in 2023 to be down about 40% from the normal 2015 to 2019 average levels, we had discussed to deliver $7 billion in revenue in 2025. Our core organic revenue has grown over 300 basis points faster than we discussed with you in November of 2021. However, a recovery in the mortgage market from the levels we are seeing in 2023 upon the order of two-thirds of the loss volume is still likely needed to achieve our $7 billion goal. We are focused on driving above market growth and delivering the cost and expense improvements committed with our 2023 and 2024 spending reduction plans and as part of our data and technology cloud transformation, which are needed to achieve 39% EBITDA margins as we exceed the $7 billion revenue level. We will continue to discuss with you our progress toward our $7 billion goal as the mortgage and overall markets evolve in 2023 and forward. Now, I would like to turn it back over to Mark. Mark Begor : Thanks, John. Wrapping up on Slide 15, Equifax delivered another strong and broad-based quarter with above market performance delivering strong 10% non-mortgage constant currency dollar revenue growth, reflecting the breadth and depth of the Equifax business model and our execution against our EFX 2025 strategic priorities. At the business unit level, Workforce Solutions had another strong quarter powering our results delivering 11% non-mortgage revenue growth with adjusted EBITDA margins of 50%. As I mentioned earlier, EWS signed three new payroll processors with -- and with our TWN current records reaching 156 million, up 4 million records sequentially and up 15% versus last year. Workforce delivered another very strong quarter with a Vitality Index over 20% from innovative new products and solutions leveraging the new EFX Cloud while further penetrating the high growth talent and government verticals. USIS continued their momentum from the fourth quarter with B2B non-mortgage growth of 8% total and 3% organic in the quarter, driven by online B2B non-mortgage growth of 9% total and 3% organic as they accelerate customer migrations to their new Equifax Cloud. International delivered strong 9% local currency growth with strong growth in LATAM, Australia, Canada, India, and our European credit businesses. And our first quarter, Vitality Index up 13% continues to be well above our 10% long-term NPI framework as we delivered over 30 new products leveraging the new Equifax Cloud in the quarter. And we made significant progress executing against our EFX Cloud data and technology transformation with over 70% of our revenue being delivered from the new Equifax Cloud and we're laser-focused on completing our North America migration this year to become the only cloud native data analytics company. And we're executing against our spending reduction plans that will deliver $200 million of savings in 2023, with run rate savings of over $250 million in 2024 that will expand our margins to 36% and EPS to over $2 per share as we exit the year, which positions us for an uncertain economic environment while reducing the capital intensity of our business. And as mentioned earlier, given our strong performance in the quarter, our ability to continue to outperform our underlying markets and deliver on our plan 2023 spending reductions, we've reaffirmed our 2023 guidance for revenue and adjusted EPS. We're entering the next chapter of the new Equifax as we pivot from building the Equifax Cloud over the past four years to leveraging our new cloud capabilities to drive our top and bottom line. We're energized by the early benefits of the Equifax Cloud. We're delivering on the cost benefits we outlined four years ago, and you're seeing our margins expand. The competitive benefits of being always on the faster data transmission and digital macro are positioning us for share gains. The power of a Single Data Fabric where all our data has moved from siloed environments to a single data environment is allowing us to deliver unique solutions like our new mortgage credit report leveraging NC Plus data, OneScore leveraging all our alternative -- all of our alternative data, and a wide array of trended solutions leveraging our historical data. NPIs leveraging our differentiated data and cloud capabilities are accelerating and well above our 10% long-term Vitality goal with over 13% Vitality last year and 13% in the first quarter. Even more encouraging is Workforce Solutions NPI results who completed most of their cloud work early last year and is delivering over 20% Vitality in 2023. This is exciting time for Equifax and I'm energized about our strong above market performance, but even more energized about the new Equifax in 2023 and beyond. We're convinced that our new Equifax cloud-based technology, differentiated data assets and our new Single Data Fabric and market-leading businesses will deliver higher growth, expanded margins, and higher free cash flow in the future. And with that operator, let me open it up for questions. Operator : Certainly. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is now live. Manav Patnaik : Thank you. Good morning. Mark, I was just hoping you could talk a little bit about what your regional bank exposure is and just broadly how you factored the credit tightening that we are hearing about into your guidance because it sounds like on a non-mortgage constant currency basis, you're actually raising the outlook a bit, which seems counter to those trends. So was just hoping you could help us parse those through. Mark Begor : Yes. We -- maybe I'll start with FinTech. As you know, we have a FinTech business. Our position there is smaller than at least one of our competitors, and we've been seeing tightening in that space for a number of quarters. I think it started really almost a year ago with the FinTech tightening really from their balance sheet challenges. We haven't seen much impact, if you go to mid-size banks, we expect them to continue to originate. There'll be some tightening there as we outlined, and we believe that's factored into our second half guidance where we expect to see a slowdown in some of the originations. But as you might imagine, the bulk of our revenue comes from the larger FIs that haven't been impacted by this balance sheet impacts or balance sheet tightening from deposits. Manav Patnaik : Got it. John Gamble : And in terms of full-year -- in terms of full-year, the slightly -- the comment you made about were slightly stronger given the adjustments in FX. What you're seeing is international's actually performing a little better, right? So in our 2023 guidance, we did take up our expectation for international growth by about 100 basis points. Manav Patnaik : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then Mark, obviously, you've talked about your tech transformation a lot and you just mentioned the always on Single Data Fabric, et cetera, but with all the news around AI and ChatGPT and so forth in the media. I was just hoping you could talk about where you are with your capabilities there and the risks and opportunities you see. Mark Begor : Yes. It's a great question, Manav. It's one that we've talked about before. And we've been working and deeply involved in AI on our data analytics team for a long time. You've heard us talk about NDT, which is one of our patented solutions around explainable AI that we're using both internally and with our customers, and it's embedded in our ignite solution. And our relationship with Google, as you know, we're on the Google Cloud brings very strong capabilities to us that we're leveraging to expand our AI capabilities. And as you point out, I think this is a big I would call it a macro meaning for the industry of using AI to really drive more predictability and manage more data going forward. And we believe we're uniquely positioned to really take advantage of the AI capabilities by having number one, all our data in the Single Data Fabric, which as you know is unique to Equifax. And then second being cloud native. As we complete the cloud over the coming quarters, principally in North America that's going to allow both Workforce Solutions and USIS to really leverage those AI capabilities to just bring new solutions and more solutions leveraging more data to our customers going forward. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Kyle Peterson from Needham & Company. Your line is now live. Kyle Peterson : Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. I wanted to follow-up on Manav's question, on some of -- some of the concerns of credit crunch and kind of some of the shifting in deposits, but just wanted to see if in March kind of at the peak of some of the volatility with the regional banks. Did you guys see any in disruption, whether it be. temporary or modest in volumes kind of when everything was happening with some of these regional banks or were you guys largely unimpacted given the heavier exposure to the money centers? Mark Begor : Well, I would say even though, as you know, our mid-size banks, there was no impact that we could see or measure really in the -- in March or really in April so far from deposit tightening, you know what we mentioned that we've seen some tightening in some areas, FinTechs, for example number one, because of delinquency concerns in subprime consumers, which I would characterize as unrelated to the deposit and balance sheet issues that some of those FinTechs have been having. And broadly we haven't seen that impact. It's really been more just risk management from tightening around certain credit ban because of concerns around consumer exposure. And again is that you heard my comments earlier, broadly the consumers still quite healthy and broadly delinquencies are still very manageable and low versus kind of historic levels which is allowing our customers to continue to originate. But back in February, and again, today, we still are looking at the second half as being what we characterize as some level of slowdown, and that's reflected in our guidance and how we think about our ability to deliver in the second half. And that's reflected in our reaffirmation of the full-year guidance, we think that strength of the broader businesses and remember, there's a lot of Equifax businesses that are outside of financial services. When you think about Workforce Solutions government, Talent Solutions, our employer business, many of our identity and fraud businesses in USIS are not in financial services. So there's a diversity element, of course, we have an international business is quite large that's all a part of Equifax. John Gamble : Yes. As Mark mentioned in DDM, we did say in pre-screen, we are seeing some impact right from FinTech as well as smaller financial institutions. And that's really where we're seeing it in pre-screening and why pre-screen was weaker. Kyle Peterson : Got it. That's really helpful color. And just as a follow-up on the Talent Solution side of the business, it seems like 1Q was at least a little better than 4Q on the revenue side of things. It seems like some of that is likely price, but just wanted to see if you guys, do you have any color? Was this predominantly pricing? Is there any seasonality? Because I guess it seems like some of the hiring data seems a little cautious from what we've seen. But just wanted to see if you could help us square the puts and takes of that sequential bump up in the Talent Solutions revenue. Mark Begor : Yes. I think you point out the underlying market is declining. There's less hiring going on for sure. You have a combination of companies doing layoffs and when companies do layoffs, they generally tighten up headcount addition. So we're clearly seeing that that started in the fourth quarter and continued through the first quarter. Really, it's kind of a similar decline. And then what's offsetting that is remember, we have a large business here, but the TAM is huge. It's about a $5 billion TAM and we've got a -- almost a $400 million business here. So we have a lot of number one penetration opportunities. So even if the market's declining, we have the opportunity to add new customers or get more market share with existing customers, which are primarily background screeners. Number two, as you point out, every year we take up price generally in the first quarter. So that price benefit, that is in the results in the first quarter, and that's a positive. And you heard us talk about some of the new products which really is driving that penetration. We've rolled out a number of new products in the first quarter that are also benefiting the talent business. And then last would be record additions. As we add new records, we have more jobs on our database and those allow us to have higher hit rates, when background screens are completed. So the number of levers that workforce has in that vertical, and frankly in all those verticals allows them to outperform their underlying markets quite strongly and that's inherent in their business model. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Andrew Steinerman from JP Morgan. Your line is now live. Andrew Steinerman : Hi John, what's implied in the 2023 guide in terms of organic constant currency revenue growth on non-mortgage basis? So this is for 2023 versus the 8% that was in the first quarter. John Gamble : Yes. So I don't think we gave an organic number for the full-year, right? But what we are expecting to see as we talked about is nice strength and strengthening in our total non-mortgage growth as we go through the rest of the third quarter and fourth quarter. Andrew Steinerman : Okay. Could you just talk a little bit about that acceleration in EWS? You've already been pretty clear about the international momentum. John Gamble : Sure. So I think what EWS is continuing to see very good performance in government. We expect to continue to see that, that move forward as we go through the rest of the year. They're also seeing really nice progress in new product. So we're expecting to see good acceleration in NPI across -- Mark Begor : Record additions. John Gamble : Record additions as we go through the rest of the year, as well as they added three new payroll processors in the first quarter. And we expect to see accelerating growth in records as we go through the year. So I think all of those things will help us continue to drive higher performance in non-mortgage in EWS as we go through the rest of the year. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Andrew Jeffrey from Truist Securities. Your line is now live. Andrew Jeffrey : Hi, thanks, and good morning. Appreciate you taking the question. Mark, you mentioned trended data in EWS, which is pretty intriguing. Can you discuss a little bit kind of what the price differential is on some of those newer trended data products? And then sort of as a follow-up, can you also just refresh us on what percent of EWS inquiries go unfulfilled today either because you don't have the data or you don't have the records in the database, and how you think those trends move over time? Mark Begor : Yes, yes. Two great questions. On the first one, that's a big part of not only EWS, but across Equifax, but EWS when they completed the cloud last year was really able to unleash a lot of the capabilities around leveraging their historical dataset. And I think as you know, we keep every record so we have over 600 million records. And if you think about mortgage or you think about auto or so many other verticals understanding how much someone has paid today is very valuable. But having the history of what they're paid and is that pay increasing? Is it decreasing? Is it staying the same? Or if you've got a employee an individual who's compensated with a sales commission on a quarterly basis or an annual basis, that won't be picked up in the snapshot today. So trended data is very, very valuable. And we talked about in the call that we launched in I think it was in the early in the fourth quarter, a new mortgage 36 product that gives 36 months' worth of history of employment leveraging our historical data. And that's become a very strong seller inside of the mortgage space. And that sells at really multiples meaning 2 to 3x what a snapshot would sell for are basic income and employment data sales for $40 to $50 to $60. The trended data will be multiples of that because it delivers so much more predictive information for our customers. And our customers are buying it. Same thing in other verticals around that historical data is very valuable in background screening, some employers are looking for last job worked for certain jobs. Other employers are maybe in a white collar role are looking for five years' worth of history. And we obviously sell that longer history at a higher price point versus just the snapshot. So that's a big growth player for us. And I think we talked on the comments earlier, the formal comments that Verifier revenue now is approaching 50% including historical records and that's up dramatically from a number of years ago. So that's driving workforce revenue and margins. And again, it's leveraging the cloud capabilities and our focus on new products to drive it going forward. Your second question on records, as I mentioned earlier, there's about 220 million working or employed individuals in the United States, including a 167 million, 168 million non-farm payroll, 20 million to 40 million gig or self-employed individuals. And remember, a 1099 self-employed employee or worker could be a doctor, a dentist, a lawyer, very high paid jobs or they're also are going to be a Uber driver. So there's a wide array of employees in that 20 million to 40 million. So we're going after those records. And then there's another 20 million to 30 million defined benefit pensioners in the U.S. and that's pension income is income that our customers want to use when someone who's retired or receiving pension income is going out to get a financial product, whether it's a mortgage and auto loan. So against the 220 million total income producing individuals in the United States we have about 117 million. So we're -- our hit rates are well north of 50%. But what the real opportunity is, as we continue to grow records and it's just a very unique lever for any business to have because as you know, we're already getting the inquiries to Workforce Solutions for every applicant that our customers have. And when we're not able to fulfill, they have to do it manually through using paper pay stubs and calling around to employers. So as we add new records during the quarter, we're able to monetize them instantly because we already have the inquiries or the orders coming to our database. So that's why we have such a big focus and a large team of workforce solutions people focused on all those different verticals to add records to Workforce Solutions. And when you think about records being up double-digit that translates into double-digit revenue, so it's a very powerful lever for the business. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Your line is now live. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, thank you very much. Hey this one might be for John. Can you talk about the non -- the mortgage and non-mortgage organic Verifier revenue? I think that was given out in previous quarters, but I didn't see it on the slide. And then I have a follow-up. John Gamble : So again, what we talked about, I think in the quarter is we had very good growth in total. It was about 16% I think in Verifier and then 11% growth. We didn't give a specific organic number. Acquisitions weren't that substantial in EWS in the past year so that there's really not a significant impact from acquisitions. And really what we're expecting as we just talked about a minute ago to drive the growth as we go forward is really continued acceleration in growth in government and continued addition of records, benefits of new products, as well as additional pricing that should allow us to get, to drive back to total growth in the back half of the year that's above 10% as it was in the first quarter. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. Thanks. And then when you talked about the new payroll processors, obviously this is a significant effort on the company's part to go ahead and continue to add the records, but I didn't see the comment that those were exclusive like we have seen in previous quarters. Was that just left out or were some of them just not exclusive? Mark Begor : No. The contracts that we're signing are and will continue to be exclusive going forward. That's our plan and these work. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Andrew Nicholas from William Blair. Your line is now live. Andrew Nicholas : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start, it doesn't seem like from the deck there was any mention of the identity and fraud business in the quarter. Just wondering how -- how that's trending both in the first quarter and what your expectations are for progression as we move through the year there. Mark Begor : Yes. It's still strong growth. We should have called it out. There was not intended to not do that. We've got a lot of good things happening at Equifax and we should have highlighted that one also, as you know, we acquired Talent, a couple years ago and we've added Midigator last year and those two businesses in United States and actually globally are performing very well and continuing to deliver that double-digit revenue. So they're a part of that USIS -- strong USIS performance. And as you know, identity is an area that is a priority focus for Equifax both around new products is around -- as also -- and also around M&A and the identity and fraud team are rolling out new solutions to really expand their capabilities, not only in count space, in the retail world, where e-commerce has been their focus. But as you know, we've got a large in expanding identity business in FI, insurance and telco, where we're bringing new solutions there also. Andrew Nicholas : Great. Thank you. And then for my follow-up, I wanted to ask about mortgage growth in EWS. It looks to me like the outperformance relative to inquiry volumes has been narrowing or at least narrowed in the quarter. I'm just wondering if there's anything to read into that, is that a lower kind of normal level of outperformance to expect through the rest of the year? Or if you could just kind of unpack the 38% mortgage decline relative to the 44% decline in increase in the first quarter that would be helpful. Thank you. John Gamble : Yes. I think the more relevant comparison really is against originations, right? Because USIS obviously ties very closely to credit inquiries, but EWS is much more closely tied to originations because EWS TWN data is not pulled as early in the cycle of a mortgage as credit is. So it's very closely tied to an origination. And the 20% outperformance relative to originations, we think was very strong and very consistent with our expectations. So we feel really good about the way they're performing. And again, it's all the things Mark's already referenced, strong record growth, good performance and pricing and especially in the last couple of quarters, they've done an outstanding job of rolling out mortgage 36, which is their new trended product, which has been very beneficial in which the rollout will complete here as we get through first quarter and into second quarter. So we feel really good about their outperformance against mortgage. Mark Begor : They were also off a tough comp from last year. John Gamble : Very tough comp from last year. Mark Begor : Very, very strong outperformance from some of the new products that were rolled out late in 2021 and into 2022. They had a very, very strong 2022 and we're pleased with their outperformance. We think it's very strong. Andrew Nicholas : Makes sense. Thank you. Didn't account for that new month? Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Craig Huber from Huber Research. Your line is now live. Craig Huber : Yes. Good morning. Thank you. First question, can you just give us a little more detail, if you would, in the U.S. for auto in your credit card business, how that did and maybe what your outlook is for the rest of the year? John Gamble : So I think we indicated that auto performed well, right? And we also indicated, I believe that that FI or banking right was about flat, right? And our credit card business was inside of FI. Mark Begor : And I think we also said in the comments that what was driving the FI to flat was FinTech down, which has been under pressure from originations for a while. Some slowdown, but limited in the smaller banks and continued growth with the larger FIs. So there was kind of a balancing impact in there. Craig Huber : And my final question guys, your uses of free cash flows, your thoughts here changed. Do we expect anything different here than other than just potential debt paydown? Mark Begor : Yes. We're still focused first and foremost on growing the company and expanding our EBITDA margins. And I think as you know, Craig as we complete the cloud, our CapEx will come down, it's down this year. It'll -- our plan is to take it down again next year. So that's going to expand our free cash flow. Certainly, our margins will continue to expand. And when we think about uses of free cash flow, no change, our 1 to 2 points of revenue growth from bolt-on M&A is a part of our capital allocation strategy. And then as you know, we've got Boa Vista in the pipeline to add to Equifax, which is actually a bit north of that 1 to 2 points of revenue growth. And then we've been very clear that in the future, as our margins move towards that 39% in 2025, our free cash flow will continue to expand and excess free cash flow beyond what we use for M&A and CapEx. We want to return to shareholders at the right time, through buyback and dividend. And that's certainly a part of our plan in the future. Craig Huber : Sorry. John Gamble : Very near-term, right? We're focused on reducing leverage and as we move through 2023 and early 2024, you'll see us focus on leverage reduction. And I think in the back half of the year, focus on integrations, obviously as we complete BVS and integrate the other acquisitions we've done over the next couple of years. Craig Huber : Sorry. Back on the first question for auto and credit card outlook for the second half of the year. Can you just touch on that a little bit further? Thank you very much. John Gamble : Yes. So we didn't really give a forecast by segment, right? But I think what we did talk about is that embedded in our guidances and expectation is we'll see generally weakening markets as we go through the rest of this year. That's certainly true in the U.S. in the back half -- sorry, in the back half of this year in the U.S. but also in most of our international markets. We didn't give specific forecasts around auto and/or FI. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Kelsey Zhu from Autonomous Research. Your line is now live. Kelsey Zhu : Thanks for taking my question. So LinkedIn is introducing an employment verification product. I was wondering does that impact how you think about EWS pricing or growth trajectory at all. Mark Begor : We don't. There's a number of solutions out there from FinTechs and as you know experience got a business there too. The scale of our dataset, our ability to continue growing that dataset and the fact we get verified records directly from the source meaning the company's payroll records and the depth of the record also as you probably know we get over 50 attributes in every payroll record that includes name, social, date of birth, job title, which is very important for our employer vertical. But then all kinds of details on the payroll, gross pay, net pay, deductions, stock compensation, incentive compensation, sales compensation, hours worked, et cetera. So the depth of our database, the fact that it's current every pay period, and the scale of it really gives us a very strong position. And then last, I think as you know, we have system to system integrations that we've built in all of our verticals where as a part of their workflows, our customer's workflows, they hit our database. So we're hit first. Where solutions like you described or some of the FinTechs play in is where there's not a verification available from Workforce Solutions, and you have to go to another source, which is typically manual. And that's why we have a partnership with Yodlee, where we do bank transaction data and there's other solutions like that. But you've seen continued super strong growth from workforce because of the uniqueness and scale and depth of the dataset. Kelsey Zhu : Got it. Super helpful. My second question is on consumer solutions. So the strong growth there, I was wondering, is that more driven by volume or market share gain? Mark Begor : Yes. That's a -- that business is a direct-to-consumer business that where we sell credit monitoring solutions and other solutions like that. It's really the business has rolled out some new products. It's leveraging our new cloud capabilities and just having better performance in some of the success rate of landing new consumers that want to use our credit monitoring solutions in the marketplace. So we're pleased with that performance and having it return to growth, you may recall that it struggled a year ago, two years ago. And as we got into the cloud and leveraged those capabilities and rolled out the new products, we've had some better performance, which we're pleased with. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Jeff Meuler from Baird. Your line is now live. Jeff Meuler : Yes. Thank you. Good morning. So I guess I had a different take on the Verifier Talent. I guess that the revenue dollar stepped up sequentially, but when I look at the year-over-year, I guess revenue plus 10, gross hiring minus 6, I think that's an industry metric. And then records plus 15, mathematically that seems like the story. But you're calling out several other, I guess, structural growth drivers or factors. I know you've gotten asked a lot about one specific situation referenced by another public company, but just if you can help me on the other structural growth drivers or if there's any other offsets to them we need to consider. Thank you. John Gamble : One thing I would change in your walk there, Jeff, I think you're hitting a lot of the right points is the record growth. Remember, in Talent, we use our historical records and current records growth is very important, but most of what we're leveraging is not records from the quarter in that business, it's records over the last year, two-year, three-year, four-year, five years. So that that isn't going to be quite as big an impact as far as higher hit rates as we add in essence what you're adding, you want to add is more jobs. New product rollouts as we talked they've rolled out a couple new products actually a number of new products over the last 12 months to 18 months. So those are benefiting kind of on a year-over-year basis as they're embedded in with our customers principally background screeners. And we rolled out a couple new ones in the quarter; one for the hourly workforce that we think is going to provide growth to us going forward. And then the other growth lever for that business to offset a declining market is just pure penetration. Remember, we're doing in rough kind of high-level math, 2 in 10 or 3 in 10 background screens are using our data. The others are still using the manual DPO kind of process. So that's an opportunity for the business. I don't know if that's helpful. Jeff Meuler : It is helpful. Thank you. And then I'm just a 36% plus and $2 as a launching off point. I just want to make sure I'm thinking through the seasonality correctly. I guess in future years there is still some seasonally lower margin or EPS in Q1, but from timing of equity grants and other factors, but it's nowhere near as pronounced as it was in 2023 because there was a one-time catch-up in 2023 that impacted Q1. Just want to make sure I have that right. Thank you. Mark Begor : So I think he's talking about the incentive compensation impact in the first quarter along with the equity compensation impact. John Gamble : So -- so specific to equity, no, the impact each year is probably relatively similar, right? Because it's just the fact that the grants that are executed in the given year based on the structure of the programs now currently end up being -- the expense ends up being taken in the first quarter. As Mark mentioned, in terms of the impact on our margins going from fourth to first of 20 -- fourth of 2022 to first of 2023, we did obviously have an incremental impact as we normalize cash incentive compensation, and that's not something that we should see each year going forward, but the equity incentive compensation, yes, that's something you'll see each year. Mark Begor : But I think to your question, the cost out is quite substantial meaning our cost structure is going to be meaningfully lower as we exit the year in complete the restructurings that we're talking about. And I think we've also talked, I think on the last call, we expect to have number one carryover benefit because these cost outs happen throughout the year. So we're not at full run rate of those cost actions in the fourth quarter. So you get a benefit in 2024 that'll help our margins next year. And then we also expect to have further cloud savings in 2024 as we complete -- we're not fully complete with the cloud at the end of this year, so there'll be additional benefits from that. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Heather Balsky : Hi, thank you for taking my question. Can you help update us on your plans around your USIS product launch strategy now that you've finalized your tech transformation? I'm curious; we've seen some releases around recent product launches. Should we see those launches ramp more meaningfully this year? And when do you think we'll start to see a benefit to sales from these efforts? Mark Begor : Yes, 100%. Just as a reminder, USIS is not complete with their cloud transformation, but they're in the final chapters. So we're going to complete that this year. We have a meaningful number of customers already on the USIS cloud, which is a big deal. And we are -- you are seeing an acceleration of new product rollouts in 2023 already from the USIS team, you may have seen our announcement, which I didn't talk about this morning of our -- we talked about in February of our new mortgage credit report, where we're adding our cell phone utility data to that, that's going to provide a meaningful lift in credit scores for consumers by the addition of that data. And we're the only ones that can do that. So that's going to be a very positive product for us in the mortgage space. I talked about this morning the new OneScore solution that combines our cell phone utility data, which is a very large data set for Equifax that only we have along with our Teletrack and DataX solutions on 80 million consumers in the U.S. So that's another new solution that will be additive to the credit file and differentiate USIS in the marketplace. So that's a brand new product that's out there. We also launched a new solution in our commercial business that's really driving that business growth. And that's one that's been in the marketplace, a little bit longer for a few months, but you're seeing very strong double-digit growth in our commercial business. And in that solution, we're combining our bank transaction data with -- along with our PayNet leasing trade line data, which driven -- which delivers very meaningful predictability lifts and performance lifts for our commercial customers. So big time, we have a -- you're already seeing it the early days of them rolling out their solutions. And I think you are seeing it in some of the revenue in the businesses. And that'll continue to show up as we complete the cloud in USIS later this year. The other lever that's going to be I think we've talked about is we expect to have competitive or market share gains from the stability meaning always on, as well as the data transmission benefits from the Equifax Cloud or USIS. So that's another lever, and we've been clear that we're in active dialogues with customers that are moving Equifax into preferred positions because of our investment in the cloud. And again, there's another USIS benefit. So those impacts on their revenue should show up as we move through 2023, but really kick in, in 2024 and 2025. Heather Balsky : Thank you. That's helpful. And just as a housekeeping question, there was a $25 million adjustment related to M&A integration. Just curious, which -- what's that related to in particular is that including anything with Boa Vista or is it other past transactions? John Gamble : Yes. So you're talking about the difference between our adjusted and unadjusted financials, no, we include M&A integration for a period of time outside of our adjusted EPS, and that's just the M&A integration related to the -- some of the transactions have been completed over the past 18 months. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Toni Kaplan : Thanks so much. I was hoping to ask about the margin ramp in the second half. I know you talked about the $200 million of expense savings with a bulk of that coming from OpEx. But I guess just how much of the margin expansion is in the bag, if you will, based on spending that's going away versus how much is based on scale or improvement in the business? John Gamble : Well, I'd say in the second half, there's a significant amount, obviously from spending reductions. And there's a lot of execution to do in order to generate those spending reductions. We feel confident that we're going to do it. But -- and we're executing very well through April on doing that, but we're focused on delivering those spending reductions and expect to do that. So it's a significant amount of the improvement in the second half. But we also do have some revenue ramp in the second half, right? We talked about some growth that we're expecting to see in EWS, specifically around their non-mortgage segment. We're expecting to see continued strong performance across international good performance in USIS even across non-mortgage. So we are expecting to see those improvements in revenue, which will also help drive margin enhancement. So it's really in both areas. Both are meaningful and there's execution necessary for both of them in order to deliver the 36% plus margins. Mark Begor : Maybe just add on that, I'm not sure I'd use your term into bag, but I would say we have a high degree of confidence because we have real visibility around the cost reductions. Those are ones where we know when contractors are going to leave and when we're going to decommission data centers, that's all in our control. So that gives us a lot of confidence and the ability to execute against that if that makes sense. Toni Kaplan : Terrific. And for a follow-up, wanted to ask about work number, there've been a few income and employment verification providers moving into the space. I guess how do you see the long-term playing out? Are there specific areas where maybe new competitors can compete in like current employment more recent employment versus like you're providing a lot of value with the historical and have the advantage there? So just I guess maybe long-term competitive wise how do you see the industry playing out? Mark Begor : Yes. It's not lost on us. There's other players there. The -- our biggest competitor, the way we think about it is pay per pay stubs. Almost 50% of income and employment verifications are still done manually in the United States. The scale of our dataset obviously is a real advantage, and we continue to grow that being up double-digit in records in the quarter, adding three new payroll processors, as you know, we add records through our employer solutions business as we grow that business in UC or W-2 or all the other services we provide to directly to HR managers, so scale is clearly a real advantage to us. And as you also point out, increasingly, the historical records that we have from our decades in the business are super valuable with 50% of Verifier revenue coming from those historical records, that's very hard to get when you're a FinTech trying to get someone's bank account information that only has the net pay in it, getting that historical net pay is a data point, but it's generally not deep enough or broad enough what to use in a lot of the verifications that that we're using. So scale is a big deal for us. The depth of the dataset meaning having gross pay through all the deductions, all those details, and then the historical records. So we're focused on expanding. I think as you know, we've done I think five acquisitions in the last 24 months to strengthen our employer capabilities there. That's a big growth lever for us to add records, and we're continuing to add payroll partners with three new ones signed in the first quarter that'll come online. So we're clearly very, very focused on expanding the record set that we have. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live. David Togut : Thank you. Good morning. Could you quantify your 2023 revenue and earnings guidance? How much you've included both from pricing actions at EWS and positive price mix from the shift to trended data particularly benefited by the new mortgage 36 product? And just as a follow-up, Mark, if you could give us a broader framework about how you think about pricing in the EWS business beyond this year in terms of how you think about balancing strong unit demand versus taking price? Thank you. Mark Begor : Yes, David, I think, as you know for competitive reasons and commercial reasons, we don't disclose any of our price actions in any parts of the business. I think we've been clear that the majority of Equifax businesses take price up every year. We generally do it on 1/1, and we did that this year and we expect to do it next year and going forward. So no question that that's a part of our strategy. And when you think about price, and I know you do, you got to think about pure price, but also the impact of our new product initiatives, which generally are delivering differentiated solutions with more data and that more data drives more predictability and value for our customers and allows us to charge more for that. So new products are clearly a lever of growth for us. And again, you should also think about Workforce Solutions in particular of having multiple levers that I would say are all important. Certainly, pure prices, pure product growth is a real margin expander and revenue expander for workforce and the rest of Equifax. Record growth certainly drives very meaningfully our top-line and our bottom line at Workforce Solutions and is very unique. Our other businesses and most other data businesses in the industry already have all the records or have marginal ability to add to them. In our case there's 220 million working or income producing Americans in the U.S. and we've got 117 of them million. So there's a lot of growth and being up double-digit in the quarter is a big revenue growth. In Workforce, we also have big penetration opportunities. Remember most data businesses; your dataset is used on every transaction and every customer that's highly penetrated. So because they've been around for a long time, even in mortgage, in Workforce Solutions close to 40% of mortgages are done manually income and employment verification. And that was 55 a few years ago. So we've grown that 500 basis point. So a bunch of levers beyond price is what makes workforce so unique in its ability to outperform the underlying markets that it competes in. Your point on balance is right on you use the right word. We try to be very balanced in all of our businesses, including workforce around what we're doing on pure price in balance. How we look at it going forward is always going to be around the value we're delivering and the unique solutions that we have. David Togut : Great. And just a second part of that, if you would on contribution from the increasing growth of trended data. I think John; you indicated half of units in USIS were now trended data driven. Mark Begor : I think that was workforce that we said that in verification, but it costs all of the Equifax businesses. This is not a new trend. But it's one where at workforce the cloud has really enabled them to really roll out a wide array of trended solutions. And we talked about in the call earlier, mortgage 36, which is 36 months of income and employment data on an individual allows the mortgage originator to more quickly get a full picture of that consumer and allow them to approve more loans, which is what they're trying to do. They spend $5,000 to $6,000 of origination costs. They want to make sure they're working with a consumer that can close and afford the loan that they're putting in front of them. So trended is a big deal, and those trended solutions all sell at higher price points than a snapshot of the data. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Seth Weber from Wells Fargo. Your live is now live. Seth Weber : Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the strength in the international margin in the quarter. Is there anything that you'd call out there either from a regional mix or I know you talked about introducing a bunch of new products? And I -- and the reason why I ask is because it looks like your second quarter margin guide comes is down a little bit sequentially versus the first quarter. And so I'm just trying to understand what's going on there. If it's maybe your cloud migration expenses are starting to ramp or anything you'd call out on international margin. Thanks. Mark Begor : Sure. So margins obviously were good in the first quarter better than we expected. Not where we want them to be long term, but better than we expected and a lot of it was driven by the really good revenue performance, right? They had very good revenue performance in all regions and really very strong revenue performance for example, stronger than you'd normally expect to see in Asia Pacific. So that along with the stronger performance across all regions, I think gave them better margin performance than we had expected. It's -- we did indicate slightly weaker in the second quarter, and that's really just related to some of the movements in revenue. There is some incremental expense as they continue to move through migration and transformation. There's certainly expense there as you go in from the first to the second quarter. But generally speaking, I think what we're expecting to see is margin performance as we described in the second quarter, and then as we move through the rest of the year, improving margin performance in international. Seth Weber : Okay. Thank you. And then just I apologize if I missed this, but did you give kind of what your -- what kind of interest rate framework you guys are expecting for the back half of the year that's kind of embedded in your guidance just -- Mark Begor : We didn't. Yes. If I was able to do that, I'd be in a different job probably, but no, we just said we expect it to be higher inflation, I think the Feds telegraphed that and we expect it to be higher and that's why we put the slowdown in the second half of our guidance back in February and we're still sticking with that. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. George Tong : Hi, thanks. Good morning. What does EWS business within non-EWS, where did you see the most change in volume growth going from 4Q to 1Q and how do volume trends need to change to achieve your full-year non-mortgage EWS outlook? Mark Begor : George, you're breaking up. I don't know if you're on a cell phone or a speaker. I think your questions about EWS and I believe it's around non-mortgage growth, but I didn't hear the rest of it. Can you try again? George Tong : Yes. Basically trying to see where we saw the most change in non-mortgage EWS growth going 4Q to 1Q and basically how those trends need to evolve to achieve your full-year non-mortgage EWS outlook. Mark Begor : Yes. So I think it's around non-mortgage in what the drivers of that EWS in 2023. First, on kind of a growth lever basis, record growth is obviously going to be positive. They did a pricing action early in the year and all the verticals, so that's going to benefit through the year. New product rollouts you've seen have been quite active with their north of 20% Vitality. And then if you go into specific verticals, I think we've given pretty good guidance of where we think talent to be meaning we expect the market to be down, but we're going to outperform the underlying talent market. Government we expect to have very strong growth, meaning stronger than the long-term framework for Workforce Solutions. We've had some very strong success of growing that business at the state level in particular and using our data for social service delivery Appriss Insights, the business that we bought a couple years ago is performing well that's going to be a driver of growth in 2023 for non-mortgage. What would you add, John? John Gamble : No, I think you covered it well, right? Mark Begor : Yes. Does that help, George? George Tong : Okay. Got it. That's helpful. Yes. Yes, that's helpful. And then on the mortgage, you outperformed your mortgage inquiries guidance in 1Q by about 10 points, but you maintained your full-year guidance for mortgage inquiries. Can you talk a little bit about your thinking there? John Gamble : Yes. So mortgage inquiries we're not quite 10 points better in the first quarter, but they certainly were better. And what we do is we took -- we take a look at our current run rates. So as we took a look at late April -- sorry, late March and early April, we took a look at the level of inquiry volumes we were seeing, and we just run a normal year against those. We normalize them for seasonality for the year. And then based on that, what it showed us is we think we're going to come in assuming no meaningful change in the Morgan -- overall mortgage market dynamics. We'd come in at about down 30%. So that that's how we take a look, and that's how we try to measure the market. As Mark said, it's really hard to forecast interest rates or what's going to happen broadly. So we try to use our current experience and then normal seasonal patterns to determine a full-year. And based on what we're seeing in late March and early April, we think that leads to about down 30% for the year. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live. Faiza Alwy : Yes. Hi, good morning. So first, just a housekeeping question on mortgage revenue. Just want to clarify that you are still expecting mortgage revenues to be down 8%. I know you've tweaked a little bit how you're thinking about this seasonal patterns around inquiries origination, but just want to clarify that that that overall revenue expectation. John Gamble : Yes. That's what we said. We said mortgage down 8% or maybe slightly more negative than that. And it's really driven by the fact that we're not seeing as we just to the last question seeing a change in inquiry volume for USIS despite the fact that originations are weaker, right? So that not a big impact on USIS of weaker originations and -- but the weaker originations do impact EWS and we're expecting that they'll be able to principally offset or at least partially offset a portion of the negative impact of lower originations by better mix. And it's specifically around mortgage 36 and increasingly more trended products. So that's how we got to down 8% or maybe slightly more negative. Faiza Alwy : Understood. And then there's been as you know, we talked about this couple quarters ago regarding the FHFA change around the credit score models, which is now being implemented in 1Q 2024. I'm curious what you're hearing from lenders and how you expect that to play out next year? Mark Begor : Yes. We're not hearing much. As we've said many times and as when that was announced I think the industry is still trying to figure out how to implement or if they implement this. There's still discussions going with the regulators about the merits of that change and what meaning does it make sense? The three credit reports actually provide more access to credit. So that's a dialogue that's still happening. But whatever impact it'll be, it'll take some time to be implemented. Even with the so-called first quarter implementation, the mortgage originators can still pull three credit files. It's not mandatory to pull two, it's mandatory to pull three today. Now it'll be mandatory to pull two or more going forward. So the implementation will likely be delayed. And then I think as you know, we've also proactively not aligned with this, but the timing was great, rolled out our new mortgage credit file that has the cell phone utility data elements in it that's going to really drive the value of our file versus our competitors. It's something they can't do because of the scale of our cell phone utility database. So we're trying to position our file as being more valuable in going forward. And then maybe one last point, as you know they also -- what is also mandated is to go from one credit score being the FICO score to be two credit scores FICO and Vantage. And that's a good guy for us and our competitors, two scores is going to allow us to have a revenue increase versus one. And I think the thinking there is it's going to -- there's enough differences between the two scores, just like there are between the three credit files that the two scores will drive access to credit and drive predictability and approvals. Faiza Alwy : Yes. Understood. If I may just ask John a quick question on cash. I know you don't guide to cash flow, but can you give us -- and you mentioned CapEx, but can you give us sort of some of the other factors that we should be thinking about as we model our own cash flows? John Gamble : Well, obviously, you covered earnings and capital spending, right? Obviously, working capital is something that we continue to focus on. Generally speaking, as you look at the year, right, our working capital tends to be much more negative in the first quarter, like you saw this year, like you've seen every year because of the fact that we pay out benefit programs in the first quarter, our compensation programs and also we make our 401(k) match, right? So you tend to see a negative impact on our cash flow in the first quarter like you did this year, like you did last year. And then our cash flow tends to accelerate as we move through the year. And we're expecting to continue to make working capital improvements as we move through the rest of this year, so. Mark Begor : And if you go back to our guide to exiting the year at 36% EBITDA margins, that obviously is generating a lot more free cash flow as we exit the year. I don't know whether you're modeling the year or longer-term, but that 36% stepping off point for the end of the year into 2024, and we've also -- we haven't given actual guidance, but we've used the words that we expect CapEx to come down again next year. And of course with our 39% EBITDA margin goal for 2025 there's a lot of cash flow that'll be generated from the step from now to 36% and then 36% to 39%. And we talked earlier on the call about how we think about capital allocation. As I mentioned earlier, CapEx will come down and I think we've given guidance before John of about 7% of revenue being our long-term CapEx investment in the company, which will be more focused on new products going forward versus the cloud transformation. We also have in our long-term framework to add 1% to 2% of revenue from bolt-on M&A. So that'll be a element of our free cash utilization. But as you get out to 2024 and 2025, there'll be excess free cash flow. That'll be quite meaningful that we intend to return to shareholders through dividend and buyback at the right time. Operator : Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Trevor for any further or closing comments. Trevor Burns : Yes. Thanks for everybody's time today. And please follow-up if any questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Trevor Burns, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Investor Relations. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead. Trevor Burns : Thanks and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Trevor Burns. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the IR Calendar section of the News & Events tab at our IR website www.investor.equifax.com. During the call today we'll be making reference to certain materials that can also be found in the Presentation section of the News & Events tab at our IR website. These materials are labeled 2Q 2023 earnings conference call. Also, we\u2019ll be making certain forward-looking statements, including third quarter and full-year 2023 guidance to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain Risk Factors that may impact our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2022 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. We will also be referring certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and can be found in our financial results section of the financial info tab at our IR website. In the second quarter Equifax incurred a restructuring charge of $17.5 million or $0.10 per share. This charge is for costs principally incurred to reduce additional head counts in 2023 as we realign our business functions in advance of completing our cloud transformation. This restructuring charge is excluded from adjusted EBITDA, as well as adjusted EPS. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark. Mark Begor : Thanks, Trevor. Good morning. Turning to Slide 4, we executed well in the second quarter against a challenging mortgage and hiring markets, while delivering on our 2023 financial objectives. We continued to outperform our underlying markets with broad-based 6% non-mortgage growth against a tough 22% comp last year. We continued strong mortgage outperformance in a challenging market and very strong new product growth with a record 14% vitality index. We also executed well against the $200 million cloud and broad-based spending reduction program we announced in February and delivered 350 basis points of sequential margin expansion in the quarter. Globally, with the exception of the U.S. mortgage and hiring markets, we continue to see good customer demand across our consumer \u2013 good customer demand across our consumer, commercial and government lines of business. However, the U.S. mortgage market weakened relative to our expectations as we moved through the latter portions of the second quarter when mortgage rates moved above 7%, which will impact our results in the second half. In the quarter, we delivered adjusted EPS of $1.71 per share and adjusted EBITDA margins of 32.7%, both above the guidance we provided in April. Execution against our cloud and broader spending reduction programs was also very strong and drove the 350 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. Revenue at $1.318 billion was close to the midpoint of guidance with USIS and International delivering strong quarters, both above our expectations. EWS non-mortgage revenue at up 4% was below our expectations, but off a very strong 52% comp last year, principally due to the weaker hiring market that impacted our talent solutions and onboarding businesses. EWS had outstanding operational execution in the quarter, delivering a new product vitality index of 25% and expanded current twin records by 12% to 161 million records, a growth of 5 million records sequentially. EWS also had strong cost management as they fully operational their new cloud capabilities, delivering adjusted EBITDA margins of 51.5%, up over 100 basis points sequentially and stronger than our expectations. USIS had an outstanding quarter and delivered almost 6% revenue growth, much stronger than our expectations. Total non-mortgage revenue grew 8%, led by 9% growth in our B2B online and 10% growth in consumer solutions and adjusted EBITDA margins of 36% were also stronger than our expectations, expanding over 300 basis points sequentially. Total U.S. mortgage revenue from both USIS and EWS was down about 13% or 24 points better than the 37% market decline from pricing actions, new products, records and penetration. We continue to see stronger than expected consumer shopping behavior in these higher interest rate environments. So the weaker mortgage market we saw in June had a much smaller impact on USIS than in EWS, where their mortgage activity is more aligned with closed loans. International delivered 7% growth in constant currency, also stronger than our expectations with double digit growth in Latin America and high single digit growth in Canada and the UK CRA. International delivered 24.2% adjusted EBITDA margins of 70 bips sequentially and stronger than our expectations. New product innovation leveraging our differentiated data assets and new capabilities delivered by the Equifax cloud is also executing at a very high level. Our new product vitality index of over 14% in the quarter was a record for Equifax and 400 basis points above our 10% long-term vitality goal and up over 100 basis points sequentially. This is encouraging for the future and reinforces our long-term strategy of leveraging our differentiated data assets, our new cloud capabilities to deliver new solutions for our customers. We continue to make good progress on completing our cloud transformation. At the end of the quarter, over 70% of North American revenue was being delivered from the new Equifax cloud. We're convinced that our Equifax Cloud, Single Data Fabric and AI Capabilities will provide a competitive advantage to Equifax for years to come. As we look to the second half, we expect the weaker than expected U.S. mortgage market that we saw in the latter half of the quarter to continue through the remainder of the year. Our updated guidance is for U.S. mortgage originations to be down about 37% for the year and about 20% in the second half, a reduction of five points from our prior full-year framework. We expect EFX mortgage origination outperformance to continue to be very strong in 2023. We're also expecting to see weaker U.S. hiring market continue through for the remainder of the year, impacting Workforce Solutions talent and onboarding businesses. However, we expect to offset the hiring weakness principally from strength in the Workforce Solutions government business and continued solid performances at USIS and international. EFX non-mortgage revenue growth was up 6%, up a very strong 22% comp last year. We expect non-mortgage revenue growth to strengthen in the second half to up 11% and up over 300 basis points sequentially relative to the first half from continued commercial execution and strong new product rollouts. Our 2023 cloud and broader cost reduction program executed well in the quarter. As we continue to operate more of Equifax in the new cloud environment, we're seeing more opportunities for efficiencies and expect an additional $10 million of spending reductions in the second half. These new actions will deliver additional run rate savings of $25 million next year. So we now expect to deliver spending reductions of $210 million this year and over $275 million in 2024. And as a reminder, the 2023 savings are weighted to the second half and will deliver $65 million of 2024 run rate benefit. We expect the weaker mortgage originations to impact our mortgage revenue by about $40 million in the second half. Despite the weakening in U.S. hiring, we expect to deliver 2023 non-mortgage revenue growth of about 8% from strong growth in EWS government, USIS non-mortgage and international and stronger NPI growth. This above 8% non-mortgage growth is against a strong 20% non-mortgage growth last year, and well within our 8% to 12% long-term growth framework. The net impact of the weaker than expected mortgage market of about $40 million, partially offset by positive FX, is a reduction of our 2023 revenue guidance at the midpoint by $25 million to about $5.3 billion. The impact of the lower mortgage revenue results in a reduction of our full year 2023 adjusted EPS guidance at the midpoint of $0.22 to $6.98 per share. We remain focused on delivering EBITDA margins of 36% and over $2 in adjusted EPS per share in the fourth quarter, which we believe sets us up well for 2024 and beyond. In June we received shareholder approval for the acquisition of Boa Vista Servi\u00e7os, the second largest credit bureau in Brazil. We're energized to complete this strategic and financially attractive acquisition. We expect the transaction to close in early August and are actively planning for integration and the transfer of our cloud capabilities, global platforms and products to help accelerate BVS growth. The BVS acquisition will add approximately $160 million of year one run rate revenue in the fast-growing Brazilian market, and we expect the transaction to be slightly accretive to year one adjusted EPS. The guidance we provided for 2023 does not include BVS. We intend to provide more details on our expectations for BVS in 2023 at our October earnings call after we close the deal. Before I cover results in more detail, I wanted to provide a brief overview of what we're seeing in the U.S. economy and the U.S. consumer. Since our April update, outside the challenging mortgage and hiring markets I already discussed, the U.S. consumer and our customers remain broadly resilient. We continue to navigate a higher interest rate environment that's negatively impacting the U.S. mortgage market. Mortgage interest rates have trended upward since April and were slightly above 7% at the beginning of July and were just under 7% at the end of last week, which is clearly impacting originations. We expect mortgage originations, as I mentioned earlier, to further weaken in the second half with originations down about 37% in 2023 or 500 basis points weaker than our April framework. Broadly, consumers are still strong and working with unemployment at historically low levels, and the market is resilient with roughly 10 million open jobs against 5 million people who are looking for jobs. Inflation is starting to abate at 3% in July, which should mean we are approaching a peak in Fed interest rates. Consumers are spending and borrowing with average credit card and personal loan balances back above pre-pandemic levels. With consumers working and still leveraging pre-cloud stimulus and savings, delinquencies are still at historic low levels, and close to 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Subprime DQs are the only areas of stress that we're seeing. We're also seeing credit card and personal loan utilization increases with some delinquency increases in subprime, but more broadly delinquencies are back at pre-pandemic levels, which as we all know were very low, although they remain significantly below levels we saw in the last economic event in 2009 and 2010. Auto delinquency rates for subprime consumers are above pre-pandemic levels, as well as above levels we saw in \u201808 and \u2013 I'm sorry, \u201809 and \u201810. We believe there's been some credit tightening by our financial customers, but principally in FinTech and subprime. And looking forward, consumers holding student loans will need to resume making payments to begin in October, and we believe removing student loan payment fees will have a modest increase \u2013 a decrease on average credit scores. Beyond the weaker motors market and slowing white-collar hiring market, which had a larger impact on EWS than we anticipated in the quarter. The combination of white-collar job reductions and broad hiring freezes has reduced both background screening and onboarding activity, and as I mentioned earlier, we expect this to continue in the second half. Turning to Slide 5, Workforce Solutions revenue was down 4% in the quarter. Mortgage revenue was down 20%, but up about 3 percentage points sequentially. The decline of 20% compares to a mortgage origination down 37% as estimated by MBA based on data through May. As I mentioned, overall market performance in the latter part of the quarter weakened relative to our expectations, resulting in lower mortgage revenue than we expected in our April framework. Strong record growth, the positive impact of 2023 price actions, and strong NPI performance driven by the adoption of our Mortgage 36 Solution, which is a 36-month trended mortgage product, drove to 17 points of mortgage outperformance by EWS in the quarter. And during the quarter, about 50% of twin mortgage inquiries were for products that include EWS trended or historical information, and of course, these are all at higher price points. In the quarter, Workforce Solutions saw declines in low margin, manual mortgage verification services revenue, as some customers move some of these activities back in-house. And this negatively impacted mortgage outperformance by about 300 basis points in the quarter. EWS had another very strong quarter of record additions with an incremental 5 million records added to the twin database, ending the quarter with 161 million current records, which was up 12%, with 120 million unique records or SSNs, which was up almost 10%. Over the past five years, EWS has doubled the size of the twin database, a strong testament to the record acquisition strategy EWS has executed across the multiple segments of direct employers, third party payroll providers, HR software management companies, pension administrators, and self-employed individuals. As a reminder, twin\u2019s 120 million unique records represent individuals or SSNs on the twin database, and their 161 million current records represent current active jobs on the database, which means there's close to 40 million individuals in our data set that have more than one job, including self-employed or 1099 employees and people on defined benefit pension plans, we now covered just over 50% of the 220 million working and income producing individuals in the United States. And through our cloud tech transformation, we're expanding our capabilities to ingest all levels of records, including 1099 based self-employment records. And as a reminder, about 50% of our records are contributed directly by individual employers, as they are customers of our expanding employer services business, and the remaining are contributed through partnerships, principally with payroll companies. During the quarter we signed agreements with four new payroll processors that will deliver records during the rest of the year. The twin database now has 631 million total current and historical records, from over 2.8 million employers in the United States. Increasingly, more of our new products are incorporating current and historical records, with about 50% of second quarter verification services revenue, coming from products that included historical records. Turning the Slide 6, Workforce Solutions delivered non-mortgage revenue growth about 4%, with non-mortgage revenue, now representing over 70% of Workforce Solutions revenue. And as a reminder, EWS non-mortgage revenue was up a very strong 52% in second quarter last year, which was a very tough comp. Verification Services non-mortgage revenue which now represents about two thirds of verified revenue delivered 4% growth both sequentially and versus last year in the quarter, which was below our expectations. This was also against a very challenging 90% non-mortgage growth comp by Workforce Solutions last year. The miss versus expectations was predominantly in-town solutions from weaker white color hiring. Government performed exceptionally well, consistent with the high growth that we had expected and consumer finance declined somewhat in the quarter. In government we saw continued very strong growth with revenue up 21% off over a 100% growth last year in second quarter. And revenue also up almost 10% sequentially driven by strong growth was CMS at the state level, new products in twin record growth. Government now represents about 45% of verifier non-mortgage revenue. We expect to see accelerating sequential growth in our government vertical in the second half, driven by growth from CMS Medicaid re-determinations, ACA open enrollment volume, further state penetration and pricing from state contract renewals. We began to see incremental volumes from CMS re-determinations in May and expect to see this accelerate in the second half. This strong sequential growth will also result in accelerated second half EWS growth rates. Talent Solutions were down 6% in the quarter, but up about 1% sequentially, as we are comping off a very strong 130% growth last year from record levels of hiring in the second quarter. Also as a reminder, we are currently more heavily penetrated to white collar workers including technology, professional services, health care and financial services, which has seen greater reductions in hiring activity and broader hiring freezes than the about 7% decline that BLS is reporting through May. Approaching 70% of Talent Solutions revenue in the quarter was from industries that had negative hiring growth versus last year, with many of those industries having significant double-digit negative growth in the quarter. We are out growing the declining market from penetration of our digital solutions with background screeners, strong new product growth, continued expansion of twin records in favorable pricing. We are also seeing continued customer penetration of our new differentiated educational products. We expect these new products to continue to drive above underlying market talent revenue growth through 2023 and in a 2024 beyond. The consumer lending vertical and Workforce Solutions which includes P-Loan, card, auto and debt management was about flat sequentially, but down 11% versus last year to lower auto volumes with financial services and P-Loan declines with FinTech lenders, both principally in the subprime space. We expect modest consumer lending sequential growth in the second half driven by record growth penetration in pricing. This will result in revenue growth in the second half as we lap 2022 headwinds in the auto and P-Loan verticals. In total, we expect to see accelerated sequential growth in verifier non-mortgage in the second half, driven by strong government growth, as well as moderate sequential growth in talent and consumer lending. Employer Services revenue of $109 million was up 4% driven by growth in our I-9 and onboarding businesses despite the negative impact of U.S. hiring. In total, our UC and ERC businesses were up slightly. Despite the slowdown in U.S. hiring, we have not seen an increase in UC revenue yet. As a reminder, first quarter employer service revenues were seasonally higher than other quarters due to the higher Affordable Care Act in W-2 volumes. In the third and fourth quarters we expect to see overall growth in Employer Services sequentially from the second quarter levels driven by penetration and I-9 onboarding. Workflow Solutions adjusted EBITDA margins of 51.5% were up 110 bips from first quarter and in line with our April guidance from strong operational execution. The EWS team continued to perform well despite the macro headwinds from mortgage in U.S. hiring, outpeforming the underlying markets from strong record growth, new products, penetration and price. As shown on Slide 7, USIS revenue of $445 million was up 6% and much better than our expectations due to stronger mortgage and non-mortgage performance. USIS mortgage revenue was down less than 1% and outperformed the mortgage market credit inquiries that were down 33% by more than 30 points. The strong pricing environment that we discussed in April, both from the addition of Telecom & Utilities attributes to our new mortgage credit solution and the increased pricing for credit scores drove the very strong out performance. At $113 million mortgage revenue was 25% of total USIS revenue in the quarter. Mortgage credit increase again outperformed MBA's current estimate of originations by about five points from increased shopping behavior. We expect this increase shopping behavior to continue as we move through the remainder of the year. Total non-mortgage revenue of $332 million was up 8% in the quarter, with organic growth of about 4% and better than our expectations. B2B non-mortgage revenue of $278 million which represented over 60% of total USIS revenue was up 7% with organic revenue growth of 3%. B2B non-mortgage online revenue growth was up 9% total and 3% organically. During the quarter online revenue had strong double digit growth in commercial and identity and fraud with auto approaching 10% growth and telco and insurance growing low single digits. Banking was up slightly consistent with first quarter, with market volumes at larger financial institutions offsetting declines with smaller financial institutions and FinTechs that were more principally focused on subprime. Financial Marketing Services or B2B offline business had revenue of $56 million that was up 1%. Strong revenue growth in fraud and header, as well as risk and account reviews was partially offset by declines in marketing, principally pre-screen marketing with IXI wealth revenue growth about flat. Pre-screen marketing revenue was at similar levels at first quarter as we continue to see significant weakness from smaller FIs and FinTech in the subprime space, which was partially offset by growth from larger FIs. USIS is using the power of their ignite platform along with their proprietary data to ensure customers \u2013 to enable customers to drive deeper marketing insights and identifying extending offers to better prospects and delivering better marketing performance management. USIS has seen incremental penetration of growing pipeline from our advanced ignite capabilities. We did see limited growth in our portfolio review business, but have not seen a meaningful increase in our risk-based portfolio reviews that typically pick up during challenging economic times. USIS consumer solutions direct-to-consumer business had another strong quarter with revenue up $54 million, up 10% from very good performances in both our consumer direct and indirect channels. USIS is winning in the marketplace with strong momentum from new solutions and differentiated data and key verticals of identity and fraud, commercial and auto. We're also in active dialogues with USIS customers about the competitive benefits of the Equifax Cloud that will deliver always unsubility, faster data speeds and Equifax Cloud enabled new products driving us, which is driving a strong active new deal pipeline, which was up from the first quarter. Todd and the USIS team are on offense as they complete their cloud transformation and pivot to leveraging their new cloud capabilities to deliver new products. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 36% in the quarter, up 340 basis points sequentially and the strongest USUS margins since the beginning of the mortgage market decline a year ago. EBITDA margins were up sequentially from better than expected revenue performance and good execution against their cloud and broader cost reduction program. Turning the Slide 8, international revenue was $290 million, up 7% in constant currency and better than our expectations. Europe local currency revenue was down 2% through the expected about 16% decline in our U.K. debt management business. As we discussed previously, our U.K. debt management business was very strong in the first half last year, as the U.K. government made large catch up debt placements following COVID debt collection moratoriums. As a result, we expect to see declines in the first half versus last year. We expected to see those declines. However, we do not expect \u2013 we do expect to see consistent sequential debt management growth as we move through the second half and we expect debt management to return to revenue growth later this year. Our U.K. and Spain CRA business revenue was up 7% in the quarter in a very good performance. This strong performance was driven principally by strong growth within identity and fraud decisioning consumer and direct-to-consumer. Asia Pacific delivered solid local currency revenue growth at 4%, with growth in commercial identity and fraud and D2C, as well as continued very strong growth in our India business which was up 38% in the quarter. Latin America local currency revenue was up a very strong 23%, driven by double digit growth in Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Central America from new product introductions and pricing actions. This is the ninth consecutive quarter of strong double digit growth for Latin America which we expect to continue in the second half. Canada local currency revenue was up 8% with broad base growth in consumer and identity and fraud decisioning and commercial. In Canada we recently completed a full migration to our new cloud base fraud IQ exchange and now have all of our Canadian fraud exchange customers on this new cloud based solution. International adjusted EBITDA margins of 24.2% were up 70 basis points sequentially and better than our expectations. The improvement was driven by good execution against their 2023 cost reduction plans. Turning now to Slide 9 and the second quarter overall non-mortgage, constant dollar revenue growth of 6% was lower than our expectations, but against a very strong 22% growth last year. USIS and international, both delivered stronger non-mortgage growth than we expected. This was offset by the slower growth in EWS non-mortgage that I mentioned earlier in Talent and non-boarding, despite their very strong growth in their government business. As we looked at the second half, we expect non-mortgage revenue growth to grow sequentially in the third and fourth quarter, led by very strong growth in the EWS government business, and growth in EWS talent and consumer lending from new products. We also expect continued strong performance in USIS and international, resulting in third quarter Equifax non-mortgage revenue growth above 9%, which is well within our 8% to 12% long term growth framework. Turning to Slide 10, new product introductions leveraging our differentiated data and the Equifax Cloud are central to our EFX 2025 growth strategy. In the second quarter we launched over 30 new products and delivered a record 14% Vitality Index. Our second quarter VI was again led by strong performances in EWS and Latin America. In the second quarter over 80% of our new product revenue came from non-mortgage products leveraging the Equifax Cloud. Leveraging our Equifax Cloud capabilities to drive new product roll-outs, we expect to deliver Vitality Index of approximately 13% in 2023, which is 300 basis points above our 10% long term Vitality Goal Index. This equates to about $700 million of revenue in 2023 from new products introduced in the past three years. New products leveraging our differentiated data, Equifax Cloud capabilities and Single Data Fabric are central to our long term growth framework in driving Equifax top line and margins. On the right side of the slide we highlighted several new products introduced in the quarter. These new solutions are a testament to the power of the Equifax Cloud and driving innovation that can increase the visibility of consumers to help expand access to credit and create new mainstream financial opportunities. We launched a new product this quarter, Talent Report Flex 2.0, a customizable pre-higher employment verification solution, that helps solve the challenge background screeners and HR professionals may experience when seeking to verify a candidate specific employment records. With a unique and first-to-market employer preview option, a list of employer names is now available on the work number using a candidate's SSM. This allows the customization of the employment history report by selecting only the records wanted. With the power of the Equifax Cloud, we'll bring new solutions to market to meet the needs of our customers. Turning the Slide 10, we were very excited to receive shareholder approval for our new Boa Vista acquisition in late June. BVS is the second largest credit bureau in the fast growing Brazilian market with over a $2 billion TAM. We expect the transaction to close and early August and Equifax will be able to provide Boa Vista with access to expansive Equifax international capabilities, our cloud native data, products decisioning and analytic technology for the rapid development of new products and services and expansion into new verticals like identity and fraud in Brazil. As a reminder, I mentioned earlier, we expect Boa Vista to deliver approximately $160 million in run rate revenue to Equifax and to be accretive to adjusted EPS in the first year. As I mentioned earlier, Boa Vista results are not included in the guidance we're providing today. We'll provide more detail on Boa Vista\u2019s impact in 2023 during our October earnings call after the transaction is closed. Given the size of the transaction, we plan to pause on M&A activity in the second half to focus on integration of BVS and our \u201821 and \u201822 acquisitions. And our intention is to use excess free cash flow over the coming quarters to pay down debt and reduce our leverage. Turning this Slide 12, we believe that artificial intelligence is fundamentally changing Equifax business capabilities and is becoming table-sticks for data analytics companies to manage increasingly large diverse and complex data sets, within a highly regulated data bringing unique complex challenges around AI explainability. On the left side of Side 12, our large and diverse proprietary data base \u2013 data set is a big differentiator for Equifax including our income and employment data, traditional alternative credit data, cell phone, utility and Pay TV data, identity and fraud data in our commercial and wealth data. This proprietary data at scale, heat and length in our new Single Data Fabric gives us significant advantages in using AI to build advanced models, scores and products including identity and fraud solutions, enabled by our best in class Equifax Cloud native technology. To date, Equifax has about 70 approved AI patents supporting our AI NeuroDecision Technology which we call NDT, and Explainable AI which is critical to ensuring that the correct data is used to make credit decisions that surface by AI models and scores. Equifax will continue to invest in AI as we may remain on offense, leveraging Google's Vertex AI capabilities, combined with our own Equifax NDT capabilities will be building more predictive and valuable models and scores with our expanding data set, and accelerating the speed at which we develop new model scores and products to bring more current solutions to our customers. We believe Equifax is uniquely positioned to capture the value of AI going forward. Now I'd like to turn it over to John to provide more detail on our third quarter and full year guidance. We're executing very well against our strategic priorities and delivering revenue growth and expanding margins in a challenging macro environment. John Gamble : Thanks Mark. As Mark mentioned, second quarter mortgage market originations were estimated by MBA with data through May at down about 37%, which is in line with our expectations for the quarter. As shown on Slide 13, second quarter credit increase were down 33% and also in line with our April expectations. However, as Mark mentioned, we saw weaker than expected inquiry data in June, which impacted our overall mortgage revenue for the quarter. As we look to the second half of 2023, our planning does not assume a fundamental improvement in the mortgage or housing markets from the levels we saw in late June and early July. We're applying normal seasonal patterns to these current run rates of credit and twin inquiries. In the first half of 2023, credit inquiries were down about 39% year-to-year, about 8 percentage points better than the about 47% decline in mortgage originations as estimated based on MBA data. In the second quarter, this spread narrowed to about 5 percentage points. In the third and fourth quarters, we expect this elevated impact from mortgage shopping and application activity that does not result in a closed loan to continue at about 5 percentage points. Applying normal seasonal patterns to the run rate we are seeing for mortgage credit inquiries in the end of June and early July, we expect mortgage credit inquiries to be down 31% for all of 2023, which is a slight reduction from our April guidance. However, we are expecting mortgage originations to be down about 37%, reflecting about 6 percentage points of shopping behavior that benefits credit inquiries. This is about 5 percentage points weaker than the 32% we discussed in our April guidance for mortgage originations. This full year guidance for mortgage credit inquiries would result in second half mortgage credit inquiries being down about 14%, with the third and fourth quarter credit inquiries being down about 23% and 4% respectively. And applying the 5 percentage point benefit to credit inquiries relative to mortgage originations from shopping that is consistent with what we saw in the second quarter, we would estimate mortgage originations in the second half would be down just under 20%. We are expecting the number of originations to weaken slightly in the third quarter relative to the second quarter, and fourth quarter originations to weaken somewhat seasonally relative to the third. As we have discussed in the past, Workforce Solutions mortgage revenue is more closely tied to mortgage originations. This reduction in 2023 expected mortgage originations relative to our April guidance reduces Workforce Solutions revenue in the second half of 2023 by about $40 million. As our expectation for USIS credit inquiries in the second half of 2023 is slightly weaker than our April guidance, USIS mortgage revenue did not change meaningfully. Turning to Slide 14, as Mark referenced earlier, in the second quarter we exceeded our adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted EPS guidance and delivered well against our 2023 spending reduction plan that will now deliver $210 million in spending reduction in \u201823 versus 2022 levels, including workforce reduction, closer to data centers and additional cost control measures. For 3Q we expect adjusted EBITDA margins of about 33.5% at approximately the midpoint of our guidance range. The sequential margin expansion is driven by both revenue growth, as well as the savings related to our expanded $210 million dollar spending reduction plan Mark previously discussed. As revenue grows sequentially through the second half of \u201923 and cloud and broader cost reductions accelerate, we are focused on delivering fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margins of about 36% and adjusted EPS exceeding $2 per share in the fourth quarter. Slide 15 provides our guidance for 3Q\u201823. In 3Q\u201923 we expect total Equifax revenue of between $1.32 billion and $1.34 billion, with revenue up about 6.9% at the midpoint. Non-mortgage constant currency revenue growth should strengthen to over 9% and will be partially offset by mortgage revenue that is down low single digits. FX is expected to have a minimal impact on revenue, and acquisitions are expected to benefit revenue by about 1%. As a reminder, this guidance does not include BVS. We\u2019ll provide more information on BVS at our October earnings call. 3Q\u201923 adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to increase sequentially by about 75 basis points at the midpoint of our guidance, reflecting both sequential revenue growth and the benefits of our cost actions. Overall, BU EBITDA margins in total are expected to be up sequentially for 2Q\u201923, driven by Workforce Solutions returning to revenue growth in the quarter, as well as margin improvement international. Corporate expenses for 3Q\u201923 are expected to be about flat with 2Q\u201923. Business unit performance in the third quarter is expected to be as described below. Workforce Solutions revenue growth is expected to be up about 7.5%. We expect non-mortgage revenue will return to over 10% growth year-to-year from continued strong growth in government and a return to growth in Talent Solutions in consumer lending verticals. EBITDA margins are expected to be about flat sequentially. USIS revenue is expected to be up about 7.5% year-to-year. Non-mortgage year-to-year revenue growth should be up slightly from the 8% we saw this quarter, above their long term 6% to 8% revenue growth framework. Mortgage revenue is expected to return to year-to-year growth in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be down about 100 basis points sequentially, principally due to the lower revenue. International revenue is expected to be up 4.5% in constant currency. EBITDA margins are expected to increase a very strong 250 basis points sequentially, reflecting sequential revenue growth and strong cost management, including the benefit of planned cost reductions. We're expecting adjusted EPS in 3Q\u201923 to be $1.72 to $1.82 per share. Slide 16 provides the specifics of our 2023 full year guidance. As Mark mentioned, we're lowering our full year revenue guidance by $25 million at the midpoint of $5.3 billion from the weaker mortgage market. As Mark discussed, the reduction in revenue guidance reflects our assumption that U.S. mortgage originations will decline 37% in \u201823, 5 percentage points more than our April guidance, reducing mortgage revenue by over $40 million in Workforce Solutions. As I referenced earlier, we're seeing continued high levels of shopping, which is benefiting USIS, and as such mortgage revenue and USIS is not expected to be meaningfully impacted by the lower level of originations. Total mortgage revenue is expected to decline about 13% in 2023. Partially offsetting the reduction of Workforce Solutions, mortgage revenue is positive FX. We continue to expect non-mortgage constant currency revenue growth to be strong at above 8% in 2023, slightly stronger than our April guidance. Non-mortgage constant currency revenue is expected to grow over 11% in the second half of \u201823 as continued solid performance from USIS and international and accelerating growth in the EWS government vertical more than offset the impact of weaker U.S. hiring. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to improve consistently throughout 2023, with the third quarter at 33.5% and the fourth quarter at about 36%. As Mark mentioned, we remain focused on delivering both 36% EBITDA margins and over $2 per share in 4Q\u201923. As Mark also mentioned, we're reducing our adjusted EPS guidance for 2023 to the range of $6.85 to $7.10 per share at the midpoint of $6.98. This is a reduction of $0.22 or about $35 million in operating income. This is principally driven by the loss of over $40 million of high margin Workforce Solutions mortgage revenue. We believe that our full year guidance is centered at the midpoint of both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges. Total capital spending for 2023 is expected to be slightly over $550 million. Capital spending in the second quarter was about $150 million in line with our expectations. We expect capital spending in the third quarter to decline sequentially by almost $15 million as we continue to progress U.S. and Canadian migrations to Date Fabric. CapEx as a percentage of revenue will continue to decline in 2024 and thereafter as we progress toward reaching 7% of revenue or below. As we discussed in April, we remain focused on delivering our midterm goal of $7 billion in revenue with 39% EBITDA margins. Market conditions are significantly different than when we first discussed in November 2021, our goal of achieving these 2025 goals. The U.S. mortgage market is expected in 2023 to be down about 40% from the normal 2015 to 19 average levels we had discussed, to deliver $7 billion in revenue in 2025. Our non-mortgage revenue has grown faster than we discussed with you back in November 2021. However, even after considering the additional revenue from the BVS acquisition of recovery in the mortgage market from the levels we are seeing in 2023, of on the order of two-thirds of the loss volume still needed to achieve our $7 billion goal in 2025. We are focused on driving above market growth and delivering the cost and expense improvements committed with our expanded 2023 and 2024 spending reduction plans, and as part of our data and technology cloud transformation, which are needed to achieve 39% EBITDA margins as we exceed the 7 billion revenue level. We will continue to discuss with you our progress toward our 7 billion dollar goal as the mortgage and overall markets evolve in 2023 and forward. And I would like to turn it back over to Mark. Mark Begor : Thanks John. Wrapping up on slide 17, Equifax delivered a solid quarter with adjusted EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS above our guidance despite the challenging mortgage and hiring markets. USIS and international delivered strong quarters offsetting some weakness in the EWS Talent and Onboarding businesses, to allow us to deliver revenue at about the midpoint and EPS above guidance. The breadth and depth of our businesses and execution against our 2023 cloud and broader spending reduction program allowed us to deliver despite a challenging macro environment. Summarizing at the business unit level, Workforce Solutions continue to deliver against their long-term growth strategy. While their 4% revenue decline was pressured by mortgage and hiring macros, they were comping off a very strong 21% growth last year. We expect that growth to recover in the second half, and importantly EWS had another very strong quarter of twin record additions, adding formula payroll providers, which brings a total added since the beginning of last year to 17, and increased current records to $161 million, up $5 million from the third quarter and toward 12% versus last year, with total records growing to $631 million. Workforce delivered a very strong NPI vitality index of 25%, leveraging their cloud capabilities which will benefit them in the second half and in \u201824 and beyond. In the continued growth of Twin, strong NPI and government growth positions EWS for 15% growth in the second half. And EWS operating focus delivered 51.5% EBITDA margins, which is up over 100 basis points and stronger than we expected. Second, USIS continued their momentum for the first quarter was strong non-mortgage growth of 8% total and at the top end of their long-term framework and 4% organic, driven by online B2B non-mortgage growth of 9% total and 4% organic, as they focus on customer migrations to the Equifax Cloud. USIS delivered EBITDA margins of 36%, up over 300 basis points sequentially through revenue growth and strong cost management. International delivered strong 7% local currency growth with strong growth in what\u2019s Latin America, Canada, India and our European credit businesses. And they delivered EBITDA margins of 24%, up 70 basis points and stronger than our expectations. As mentioned earlier, our second quarter Vitality Index of 14% is an Equifax record and was 400 bips above our 10% long-term growth framework, as we've delivered over 60 new products year-to-date, leveraging the new Equifax Cloud. The focus of our Equifax Cloud Data and Technology Transformation is in completing those North American migrations, which will allow us to further accelerate new product launches and complete legacy system decommissioning. Our Cloud native technology will differentiate Equifax and allows us to be an offense with leading systems stability and capabilities that position us to leverage AI tools to drive revenue growth and cost efficiencies. We're executing well against our 2023 cloud and broader spending reduction plan that will now deliver $210 million of savings this year, with run rate savings of $275 million in 2024. And this is up $10 million in \u201823 and $25 million in \u201824 from our April framework. We remain focused on delivering 36% adjusted EBITDA margins and over $2 per share in adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter, which sets us up well for 2024. And we're energized about receiving shareholder approval for the BVS acquisition in June, and we're on track to close this strategic and financially attractive acquisition in early August. And as mentioned earlier given the weaker than expected mortgage market, we're lowering our full year revenue guidance by $25 million to $5.3 billion at the midpoint, with full year 2023 adjusted EPS at the midpoint to be down $0.22 per share to $6.98 from the impact of the lower high \u2013 high \u2013 lower but high margin mortgage revenue. We're energized to be entering the next chapter of new Equifax as we pivot from building the new Equifax Cloud to leveraging our new cloud capabilities to drive our top and bottom line. This is an exciting time for Equifax \u2013 exciting time for Equifax, and we're convinced that our new Equifax cloud-based technology, differentiated data assets, and our new Single Data Fabric and our market leading businesses will deliver higher growth expanded margins and free cash flow in the future. And with that operator, let me open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question is coming from Andrew Steinerman of JP Morgan, please go ahead. Andrew Steinerman : Hi John! Let me just ask my two questions together. The first one is, could you just tell us what second quarter mortgage revenues is as a percentage of total revenues. I didn\u2019t catch that if you gave it. And the second one is looking at the EWS revenue growth guide for third quarter of 7.5% which is on slide 15, and then kind of taking it together with the comments for EWS revenue guide on slide 16. It seems to imply a rather strong revenue ramp for EWS in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, and could you just comment on that? A - John Gamble : So, your first question, it is 21%, the answer your first question. Andrew Steinerman : Thanks. A - John Gamble : And as we take a look at EWS, Mark talked about it very \u2013 I think fairly completely right. What we're seeing is we're expecting to see nice sequential improvements. I'm talking specifically about non-mortgage as we move through third quarter and into fourth quarter. A lot of it driven by very strong growth in government, which we feel very good about and the strength we're seeing in the government business, not only in the third and fourth quarter, but we've seen in the first quarter and in the second quarter. And we're also expecting to move back to see sequential growth in Talent driven by new product, and also in our consumer lending businesses, also driven by new product and to some extent penetration. So we think those factors allow us to see nice sequential growth as we go through the year. And as on mortgage and as we're now comparing against easier comps as we get into the second half of 2023 versus 2022, we see better growth rates. You're also going to see obviously better growth rates in mortgage, although we took mortgage down, right, the level of decline in mortgage year-on-year and originations declined substantially going through the year, we can expect to continue to have very good mortgage out performance in EWS, so that allows us to return to growth in EWS mortgages we get toward the best of the very end of this year. So with those two factors together, we think we're going to see nice acceleration in EWS revenue as we go through the rest of this year. Andrew Steinerman : Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Manav Patnaik of Barclays, please go ahead. Manav Patnaik : Thank you. Good morning. Maybe my first question, just to follow-up on that. I guess you addressed the revenue visibility to seem to have as your ramp up into the end of the year. Can you just talk about the moving pieces on margins? Like how confident are you to hit that 36% and how that flows through to next year? Mark Begor : I'll start Manav and John can jump in. So we\u2019ll leave the revenue leverage aside, so we have \u2013 you know we think its good visibility outside of the mortgage piece. As you know, we increased our cost program by another $10 million this year and $25 million next year. So we see additional efficiencies as we get further into the cloud completion. So combining that with the core program we announced in February, we just have a lot of visibility, because we know when contractors are leaving and when we're taking other cost actions. So that that gives us a lot of confidence in the cost side of that across all the businesses and at the corporate level. John Gamble : And again, as Mark said, good focus on cost, we have good visibility on cost and we do \u2013 obviously we do need to see the revenue growth we're talking about. But I think we feel very good about the sequential movements we're talking about in our non-mortgage business. We delivered well in non-mortgage other than the Talent impacts we talked about in the second quarter. And then obviously we've made an assumption on the mortgage market. We think we've made a reasonable assumption, but having the mortgage market deliberate the levels we're talking about, obviously it\u2019s also needed for us to deliver our 36% margins in the fourth quarter. Manav Patnaik : Got it. And then just not work force solutions, I mean I guess most of the changes are just your volume assumptions. I missed what your new gross hiring assumption is, but I was also hoping you could address \u2013 I\u2019ll confirm that you're not seeing any changes in the competitive behavior, like all these changes are really just your volume assumptions. Mark Begor : John, I'll let you jump on the hiring assumption, but you know we did mention Manav that for example in mortgage, we're seeing some mortgage originators move manual verifications back from Equifax in-house, so that had an impact us on the quarter. We expect that to continue, so that it is clearly a revenue impact and what we're seeing is that you've got mortgage originators doing less activity, so they've got people sitting in their offices and they are deciding to do some of those manual verifications in-house, so that clearly had an impact. I think there was no question that experience through, to a lesser degree, Transunion and they're kind of new focus on this or. In the marketplace we don't see that being a meaningful impact on our revenue, but they are definitely out there and they are doing more than they were a year ago. So that clearly also has an impact, particularly probably in mortgage. A - John Gamble : In terms of Talent Market I don't think we gave a percentage. I think in April we talked about the market being down like 10%. We said June was worse and that we're expecting that weaker level of the Talent Market to continue through the rest of the year. We didn't really give a number, but weaker than the 10% we talked about in April. A - Mark Begor : And again, we also commented Manav that we see ourselves over indexing to white collar employers in our customer base, and those are more impacted from both hiring freezes, you know as well as layoffs and blue collar side. Manav Patnaik : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Kevin McVeigh of Credit Suisse, please go ahead. Kevin McVeigh : Great! Thanks so much. I\u2019ll ask one multi-part question. So thanks for framing the $40 million run off. Was that purely higher rates or any dislocation from regional banks or maybe tightening standards and then I wondered if you could give us a sense of \u2013 the sensitivity on the way up. So the extent rates started to go down. Like, what would be that theoretical level, where you may see people get a little bit more aggressive with a heloc or refinance. I mean it seems like 7% was a trigger for some weakness. What level of rate and is there any way to maybe frame the sensitivity of what 6.5% might mean for the businesses as we think about 2024. Mark Begor : Yes, I think there's a lot of factors Kevin in the mortgage space. Clearly higher rates \u2013 you know I think the uncertainty around rates is as much as that consumers that are thinking about purchasing a home. Rates go up towards that 7%. They pull back and wait to see what's happening. Where will rates stabilize is an activity that we're definitely seeing. There's an element of \u2013 and you've read about this, you see it, as if the shortage of housing stock. You mean there isn't a lot of inventory out there for people to make home purchases. Those that own homes are doing \u2013 are not upgrading, you know meaning, going buying a larger home or moving in a different neighborhood in town, because of the low rate they're currently sitting on in their mortgage and some uncertainty about where rates are going. So we believe that there's some element of rate stabilization that consumers will increase their activity from that. I don't think we're thinking about rate reductions. You know that'll happen sometime in the future, whether it's a year from now or in \u201825 or \u201826 you know going forward. But as a reminder, we've never seen purchase volume declines at this level, that from historical levels we're well below 40% of below historic levels, excluding kind of a refi boom that we had in \u201920 and \u201821 and \u201922. You know that just has never happened before, so it's our view that at some point we\u2019ll return to normal historical levels, you know whether that's in a year from now, as people get more comfortable operating in a 6%, 7% mortgage interest rate environment where it\u2019s into \u201926. There\u2019ll be return to normalization over time is our expectation. What would you add John? John Gamble : Well, just I think the important thing for us also is we're continuing to drive very good performance above market, right. So again, very strong performance in the first quarter at 20 points. In the second quarter effectively 20 points if you adjust for the fact that we made a decision to not participate to the same level, in what's really a not particularly profitable manual business and we talked about how that reduced our out performance by about 300 basis points. So again, on the very high margin Digital Verification Business, again about 20 points out performance. So we feel good about our continued outperformance. We also feel good about the fact that to the extent we see a faster growing mortgage market than what we forecast that will participate very clearly and we'll see the upside from that. But, we clearly saw the reduction in transaction volume when rates moved up to above seven. It's hard to predict what's going to happen when they move back below, but to the extent that we see nice growth, from that to the extent it occurs, we think will participate well. Mark Begor : Then at some point on the other side it is high inflationary environment where the feds had to raise interest rates. There'll be a time \u2013 I'm not an economist, but at some point in the future, the feds going to reduce interest rates to boost economic activity. It's just the cycle that we typically have and there'll be another refi window whether that's in \u201925, \u201926, \u201827 but we'll be well positioned for that, and it\u2019s been a very high incremental margins on mortgage revenue declines or mortgage revenue growth. We\u2019ll see the other side of that at some point in the future at Equifax. Kevin McVeigh : Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Kelsey Zhu of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Kelsey Zhu : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. My first one is on the government vertical for EWS. So part of the acceleration of growth in the second half is coming from the government vertical which part of that is coming from the Medicaid re-determination process. I was wondering if you can talk about how much of that was done in Q2 and kind of how much do you expect to be done in Q3 and Q4. And in general, it will be helpful to understand a little better about the government revenue breakdown across different programs for Medicaid, Social Security that\u2019s down. Thanks. Mark Begor : Yes, there's a bunch of factors driving government which is the good news for us. You know it's a very important, fast growing segment of Workforce Solutions. It's one where we have a very, very strong market position given the scale of our data set to 630 million you know historical records and our active records. You point out one of the levers you know on the re-determination, we saw some of that activity pick up in May and June and we expect that to continue in third quarter and fourth quarter and much of that to be a 2023 event which is positive. We're also seeing more ACA volume. We're getting more penetration at the state level. Remember this business, which is approaching $500 million is in a TAM that's close to $3 billion and each state and each agency at the state level are separate organizations and we have a commercial team that's headquartered at many of the state capitals that's working to bring our solutions to convert current manual activity around verifications for whether it's unemployment claims or childcare support, food support, all the other social services to convert them from manual to using our automated solution. So that's a big lever for growth is we add more states and more agencies, so that we have a pipeline. We have visibility around those relationships. Another lever is we're constantly renegotiating those individual contracts that we have. And again remember, 50 states. Think about maybe six or eight agencies in each state that we have relationships with a portion of them. The ones that we have, those contracts come up and we worked \u2013 increase price for the additional value that we're delivering. And then the other lever we have is at the federal level. We have federal programs with some of the big organizations. You mentioned one security administration, those are also growth programs for us at the government level. Kelsey Zhu : Got it. My second question is on the talent vertical. I was wondering, could you share a little bit more about revenue breakdown kind of cross blue collar higher activity versus white collar. And I know you've introduced this new pre-employment verification services kind of targeting the hourly workforce, nothing that will help drive penetration with the blue collar higher activity. So I was wondering if you can talk about, how much penetration you've gained with that product and kind of the growth outlook for blue color revenue versus white collar. Mark Begor : Yes, so we participate in all employees. We're making the point that we with our current customer base, again customers being background screeners. The customers that we have tend to over index to white collar jobs, which is why we're seeing more of an impact right now. But we have a lot of blue collar jobs coming through and employment verification work that we do. The new solution on hourly has only been in the marketplace for 30 days, so it's very new but we've seen very positive traction. We think it's not only going to drive penetration, with our existing customers, but it's also going to allow them to drive growth and their business. Meaning they can go out and pick up more volume or share in those kind of employees doing verification work. We also talked about some of the other solutions we have outside of just employment history. We've seen very positive growth in our education solution, where we have an instant solution around verifying education backgrounds which is used in a lot of white collar job. That's a newer solution for us that we've been in the marketplace for call it a year, but we're growing a lot of usage and share with that, so that's a positive for the Talent business. And then the last one is you know, we have our insights business that we acquired a couple years ago that has the incarceration data and that's another one where we're bringing new products to market and new solutions. So for talent, you've got the ability to drive penetration. That business is a north of $400 million at run rate in a $4 billion TAM, so there's a lot of penetration growth opportunity there. A lot of our new product focuses around Talent. You talked about the solution for the hourly work force that we rolled out about a month ago and then we rolled out one a couple weeks ago. It provides more flexibility about which employers our customers want to focus on foreign employee, you know that's another solution that should drive growth. So new products are a big focus of ours in the Talent vertical. Kelsey Zhu : Super helpful. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. The you the next question is coming from Kyle Peterson of Needham & Company. Please go ahead. Kyle Peterson : Great. Thanks. Good morning guys. I appreciate you taking the questions. Just wanted to dig a little bit more into some of the talent weakness that you guys kind of saw is \u2013 I get that this is yeah more white color based, but I guess is within kind of verticals of the white color workforces, the hiring slowed down. You guys saw in June. It sounds like is that fairly broad based or you know that concentrated in one or two verticals or anymore color there would be really helpful. Mark Begor : It's pretty broad based. I think you look at them like we do. You see less of them, but in the first half of the year you saw companies left and right announcing either layoffs or hiring freezes. I think it was Ford a couple of weeks ago announced another white color reduction, if a company is reducing people and making those kind of announcements, they also typically have a hiring freeze in place. So there's less inbound, new hires coming in. So that clearly is not \u2013 it didn't just happen in late in the quarter, it's been happening for quite some time as we've kind of nine months into that hiring reduction that has had an impact on, is that we've been able to outgrow through pricing in 2023, through new products, through penetration, in adding new customers in the background screening space, but it's clearly had an impact, and we expected it to continue to be an impact in the second half and we've laid that into our framework. Kyle Peterson : Makes sense. And just a follow-up, on the cost side, good the additional cost savings you guys identified. This quarter it's kind of offset some of the weaker volumes. But you just wanted to think about you know if we continue to see challenging volumes whether it's through mortgage or background screening or any other areas of the business. Are there any other efficiencies and levers that you guys might be able to pull, you know if we're in kind of a prolonged period of weaker volumes and revenue per share, or you guys kind of at approaching to the max efficiency here. Mark Begor : I think as you know we're going to have a $65 million of run rate benefit next year, because a lot of the actions from the broader cost and cloud program that we have in 2023 are in the second half, so that'll be a benefit. And we've talked previously that we still expect to get further cloud efficiencies in \u201824 and \u201825 as we complete the cloud. We're at 70% now. We still got that remaining 30% of Equifax to complete over the next couple of years, and as we complete that cloud we expect to see further efficiencies that will benefit our margins and in margin rate in \u201824 and \u201925, including the carry over benefit of the cloud actions that we're taking you know in broader restructuring in 2023. John Gamble : And just as a reminder right, the actions we've already taken and the site control we have on cost broadly are allowing us to drive our margins higher in the third quarter and the fourth quarter substantially. So we think we've taken pretty significant actions already, which are allowing us to see nice improvement in margins. Mark Begor : And maybe one other point, I wouldn't think about the actions is being aligned with a revenue decline, that's not how we operate our business. The program we announced in February you expected. We talked about it last year that we would be reducing our costs as we complete the cloud. This is something we've been talking about for years. And as we said in February, in April, and again today, we're just seeing broader opportunities to improve our efficiencies as we get further into the cloud. The real backbone of these cost efficiencies and margin expansions are what we've talked about for the last three or four years and it's really driven by our ability to get closer to completion of our cloud investment. Kyle Peterson : Make sense, and that\u2019s helpful. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Andrew Jeffrey of Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Andrew Jeffrey : Good morning. I know nature of course is a vacuum Mark, but I'm just going to ask you one question, sort of high level. When I look out at the U.S. economy and think about perhaps a soft landing or a Goldilocks environment, however you want to consider it. It strikes me that there are there are parts of Equifax\u2019s business that benefit from the rate of change in the economy, either improving or deteriorating, and if we're sort of in stasis. Does that impact your business? I'm thinking about UC, I'm thinking about mortgage. Just broadly, is change as important regardless of direction? Obviously improving is better than deteriorating, but is change a meaningful impact to your growth rates, your revenue growth rates? Mark Begor : Yes, you've got to kind of break some pieces apart there. Mortgage obviously has had a huge impact on our business. It's been \u2013 we've never seen a mortgage decline like this to be 40% below \u2013 well over 40%. I think it's 45% below historic levels in the second half. It\u2019s just never happened before, that's going to recover right. It's just a matter of when will it return to call it norm, that minus 45 and that'll be a very positive thing for Equifax, and whether it's \u201924, \u201825 or \u201926, the mortgage market is not going to stay at this level. People are going to buy houses, people keep moving and then add on it at some point. When rates start coming down again from these higher levels which should happen, there'll be a refi element, so that's kind of mortgage. We're very pleased, and I hope most of our investors are of our ability to continue to drive the 80% of Equifax it's not mortgage quite strongly in what you characterize as a uncertain economic environment, the diversity of our businesses. If you look at Equifax 10 years ago being primarily a credit bureau and now you \u2013 we're talking on this call predominantly around our talent vertical and government vertical that didn't exist 10 years ago. And talent you know still performing even with a macro impact and government super strong just because of the power of the unique solutions that we have. So I think that's the kind of the underlying strength of Equifax, is our non-mortgage businesses are super strong and lay on top of that, the new product initiative, it's not an initiative, it's really how we operate. We're a product led organization leveraging our differentiated data and our cloud capabilities. You know the 14% vitality in the quality, that's great momentum for the second half in \u201924 and \u201925, meaning that we're seeing we can leverage our differentiated data assets, our product led culture and capabilities and cloud and put new solutions in market. And those new solutions are higher price points that are going to expand our margins going forward. So that's a real positive. And then the underlying macros, I think the diversity of Equifax plays into that. So is there going to be a soft landing? My personal view is there is. I think we're kind of already feeling it and seeing it with inflation down to 3%. That's going to head towards where the fed wants it and unemployment is so low, people are still working. That's a pretty good economic environment for all businesses, but importantly ours going forward. And then you lay on top of it the completion of the cloud from a kind of timing standpoint over the next year and change. And the cost benefits that you\u2019re seeing this year and margin benefits this year that carry into 2024, those are quite powerful in our ability to expand our free cash generation. And have \u2013 as we get into \u201924. \u201825 and \u201926, have significant excess free cash flow to return to shareholders at the right time. Andrew Jeffrey : Now, as usual a very comprehensive, thoughtful answer. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Jeff Meuler of Baird. Please go ahead. Jeff Meuler : Yes, I just want to make sure I'm understanding the dynamic on mortgage underwriters moving the employment and income verification in-house. Are you saying that that's just for the manual portion of the verification and you are not losing them as a client? Mark Begor : Correct. Yes, that's where we've seen it Jeff. In part of it was that customers came to us and were looking for lower pricing on the manual efforts that we do for them. I think you know we have an operation in Iowa where we do that. We opted not to chase price down because it's a low margin solution now for us, but an attractive one, and some of them moved that in-house and it was you know meaningful. Its 300 basis points of the mortgage out performance in the quarter. But no, it's isolated to that manual effort we were doing four customers. We've just seen less activity there and it's logical when you think about a mortgage originator that just has more people doing less mortgages, they can do some of that themselves. But we haven't seen the impact on the instant verification side, which is where as you know, where all our revenue and margin is. John Gamble : You've also heard some of our competitors talk about growing their manual business, and again we think that's part of the ship. This is just business that this low margin that we're moving away from. Jeff Meuler : And can you give us any sense of how much revenue you generate from doing the manual verification? Mark Begor : We didn't give totals, but we did talk about it as a level of decline right. So we said it impacted our out performance by about 300 basis points so. Jeff Meuler : Got it. And then Mark you answered the Verifier competition question a bit differently today or at least I've perceived your answer a little bit differently today. And John, you just kind of alluded to, hey, some of the competition is manual and that's low margin. But you can see the credit file inquiries, so you can triangulate share for verifier mortgage. If you look at the non-exclusive records that you have, have there been any recent share changes for digital verifications. Thank you. Mark Begor : Yes, not that I would characterize as meaningful Jeff, but we don't see it in our marketplace, but we hear our so called competitors talking about their revenue growth and I don't know what the real numbers are that some of those smaller players have, but they are definitely getting revenue somewhere. We just don't feel it in our business but we continue to watch it. Jeff Meuler : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Craig Huber of Huber Research Partners. Please go ahead. Craig Huber : Great, thank you. You obviously mentioned a 14% vitality index. Can you give us a flavor of some of the areas of the new products that you're most excited about here is you kind of think out. What's working really well? Where do you think is the biggest opportunity to growth revenues? Mark Begor : Oh man, how much time do we have, but I'll try to be precise. Craig Huber : You can give top two or three. Mark Begor : Yes, I know but first time I\u2019d start with the 14%. When we set the 10% vitality goal, remember our long term run rate, pre-cloud and pre the 10% goal was 5% to 7%. And I think 5% to 7% is what most data analytics companies do and 5% to 7% is a big number. To have 5% to 7% of your revenue from new products introduced in the time frame, we picked three years. That's a pretty vibrant innovative company. We set a goal for 10% and since we set the goal we've been over achieving it and 14% in the quarter and 13% for the year. So I would start with that I'm energized about the broad based ability at Equifax across all of our business units to leverage our differentiated data, our cloud capabilities or bring new solutions to market. That's the company that you want to have as a partner if you're a customer. Someone who is innovating to bring new solutions, because remember, all of our products deliver ROI. We are not Coke versus Pepsi or doing Sprite versus Diet Coke. We're delivering a solution that's going to help our customer to originate more consumers, lower their losses, increase they're marketing hit rates you name it, we're delivering ROI. So what excites me, certainly all of the solutions in Workforce. That would be kind of number two for me beyond the 14%. Having Workforce Solutions, that I think it was 23% vitality in the quarter, and remember Workforce is the first business at Equifax to get into fully cloud native for over a year now. And they've really been able to unleash, kind of the pent-up capacity if you will to bring new solutions to market and they're doing it in every vertical. Mortgage 36, delivering a 36 month solution of historical data to our mortgage customers. To the earlier question from Jeff a few minutes ago, our so called startup competitors can't do that. They don't have the 630 million historical records. So uniquely we can deliver a 36 solution that's integral now to many mortgage originations going back three years. So that historical data is something that super energizes me. I'll jump to USIS. Our new mortgage credit file that includes the NC+ plus, 14 NC+ attributes. Really energizing to have multi data assets delivered. The mortgage credit file is, looked the same for 40 years. We're now making ours differentiated and because of the scale of the cell phone utility database that we have, our competitors can't do that. So only Equifax can have a differentiated mortgage credit file, super exciting. The solutions for talent that we already talked about, also super exciting. So we're really focused on our new product initiative. We think it's going to drive top line in margin expansion going forward, and you're seeing us outperform the 10%, which we think is a good thing for the future. Craig Huber : My final question, as you sort of look out beyond this weak sluggish environment here into \u201824 into 2025, a lot of your business to recover very nicely next year and in the year after. So what areas are you most excited about when getting to a better economic backdrop. Mark Begor : Certainly mortgage, which we already talked about that. Mortgage 40% below, 45% below kind of historic normal market levels. That recovery which is going to happen at some point, whether it's \u201924, \u201825 or \u201826 and how it meters in, that's going to be good news for Equifax. So it\u2019s going to be very high incremental margin in EWS and USIS is that recovery takes place. You know at some point there'll be more stabilization in the hiring market. Once employers get more comfortable around the economy, I would expect there'd be less hiring freezes and you know some level of employment improvement going forward. So that you know is going to be a positive you know for Equifax. When the subprime market stabilizes, that's had an impact us on us over the last three quarters in USIS. That'll be you know positive for us going forward. Craig Huber : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Andrew Nicholas of William Blair, please go ahead. Andrew Nicholas : Hi! Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First question I wanted to ask is, just maybe a point of clarification. I hear the acceleration commentary and what makes you confident in that through the back after the year. Just wanted to make sure I understand it. Is there any change to kind of your economic assumptions for the second half as well? So you're still baking in some level of [inaudible] down on the outside? Okay. Mark Begor : Correct. 100%. It's just really our visibility around pipelines, government we talked a bunch about, that we can see just a visibility in that business and in the others, but we still have the same view of a no change in the macro. Andrew Nicholas : Got it. And then for my follow-up, a different topic entirely. Mark, you spend a decent bit of time on artificial intelligence and how Equifax is well positioned to leverage it going forward. I'm just wondering if you could speak to kind of the cost side of that equation. How expensive is it to leverage the cloud and Google Vertex in an environment where I think chips are expensive and there's some shortages there. Just wondering how you think about cost and whether or not that's a meaningful consideration when you go down the AI path, the large language model path. Mark Begor : Yes, so what I've talked most about today and what our principle focus in is around using AI to really manage large data and multi data sets to deliver better performing scores, better performing models. You may remember we rolled out a solution called One Score in April that combines some of our differentiated data assets across USIS. We used AI modeling in that and that provides significant performance enhancement, and when you deliver a performance enhancement it's more valuable when you charge a higher price. So that's going to be our principle focus around AI and no, there's not a high cost in completing AI. There's actually a bunch of efficiencies from a DNA perspective of using AI because it's just faster. You can complete more work and we'll be more productive if you will in delivering these higher performing solutions. I thought where you were going was in our operation side, where we expect to use some of the AI capabilities to improve our call centers, our operating centers. That will clearly be a leverage point for us in 24 and beyond. But our \u2013 I believe our big leverage is going to be around having more sophisticated higher performing, products scores, models and solutions. Andrew Nicholas : Makes sense. Certainly having everything on the same Data Fabric is helpful to that too. Mark Begor : Thanks Mark. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Please go ahead. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi! Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Hey Mark, I'm just asking my first question. I want to focus over one, some of the questions that came in earlier about the manual verifications to move back in-house or you know you're talking about there's some competitors over there. Like Truework has a product over there that they're very focused on the manual verifications. And I just want to ask you about strategically, as you move back a little bit from that because of pricing, are you concerned that that's going to give them kind of an entr\u00e9e into the client base, which will also give them potentially the ability to move Truework to a top of waterfall position, to take advantage of potentially getting kind of like ADP data which is not, it's not unique to all the players that are in there. And so strategically how are you thinking about that, in terms of you're not wanting to cut cost in there and then I have a follow. Mark Begor : Yes, and that one we are going to be obviously focused on maintaining our strong customer relationships. I don't know what Truework\u2019s revenue is. Maybe it's $15 million or something or $20 million. It's a fairly small player. It doesn't have really any scale differentiated data assets. We've got at the end of the quarter 161 million records. I don't even know what their record count is, but we certainly watch them. We just don\u2019t feel that they are having a meaningful impact on our business, but we certainly are keeping an eye on them. John Gamble : Shlomo, the other thing that\u2019s happening right, as we continue to rapidly grow our database, so the need to do manual verifications when you use Equifax continues to decline substantially, right. So given where we are at 120 million uniques against U.S. non-firm payroll of say 160 million, we're getting to the point now where the need for a manual verification when you use Equifax is very small. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay, great. And then hey John, also I have a question for you. I'm just trying to understand the lowering of the EPS guidance. Like the midpoint is $0.22. Even if I assume that $40 million of lower revenue coming from mortgage is above 90% contribution, I mean that would be like all of that reduction, but there's also other stuff that's doing better on USIS and government talent and you also increased by $10 million the cost savings program. It just seems to me like the midpoint of the guidance and the EPS was lower to a lot more than it needed to be. Can you comment on that? John Gamble : Sure. So really the driver was lower mortgage revenue, right. We said Workforce Solutions workers revenues down over $40 million right, so applying a very high margin to that you do get a very substantial amount of operating income. We said non-mortgage is slightly better, so for the entire company I know pieces have moved around, but in total non-mortgage is slightly better. So that wasn't a big driver a positive operating income in the changing guidance. And really the difference between the reduction of over $40 million in mortgage revenue and the down $25 million we talked about is just heavily FX which has very little flow through in terms of positive operating income, So it's really driven by the fact that we lost very high margin mortgage revenue, I mean EWS, and that really drove the reduction right. Yes, there was some cost savings, but again they weren't a big number of $10 million of incremental that we talked about. You can think that was kind of split between capital and cost. So not a big driver of recovery, so the big movement is just related to the fact that we saw the reduction in mortgage revenue. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Heather Balsky of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Heather Balsky : Hi! Thank you for taking my question. I know there's been a fair number of questions already on the acceleration in non-mortgage EWS revenue. So I just wanted to kind of follow-up here, because I think we're backing into something in a healthy double digit range for the fourth quarter. And you've outlined the drivers, but I guess where do you expect to see the most meaningful acceleration in your business. It sounds like the macro isn\u2019t changing. So just trying to understand how you go from how you did this quarter to double digit growth in the fourth. John Gamble : So Heather, if you look at it sequentially right, what we're talking about here in terms of EWS is really nice sequential improvement. We talked about this in government right, and we think government revenue is a big driver of our improvement. When you compared to last year, obviously last year what you saw was some weakening in the back half of the year as you saw weakening talent markets, etc. So the compare is easier, but if you just look at sequentially the performance we're talking about, we expect government to improve substantially as you move through the rest of the year. Mark covered very completely what the drivers of that are. And then sequentially we're also talking about seeing talent get a little better from where we are today. A lot of it driven by product, again, as Mark covered in his prepared margin and earlier answers. And then also on consumer finance we kind of think we've hit a bottom and we're going to \u2013 we'll see slight improvements in consumer finance sequentially, which again given what the second half of last year looked like, gives us growth rates that are substantially different than we saw on the first half. So the big driver in sequential improvement certainly is government. We're seeing some sequential improvements in the other segments in EWS, but that's how we think about the improvement and we think the trend we've already seen in government supports the level of improvement we're talking about. Mark Begor : And then outside of EWS, I think as we talked earlier, both USIS and international were above our expectations in the quarter and we expect them to perform well in the second half also. Heather Balsky : Okay, thank you for that. And then just another question with regards to the outperformance at EWS versus the mortgage market, you called out 17% this quarter. Is that the new run rate factored into your forecast or is there some assumption that the impact from the manual polls going in-house kind of worsened in the back? John Gamble : So again, adjusting for the impact of manual, we're at about 20 we're at about 20 last quarter. So yes, we'll have another impact. We\u2019ll have more impact as we go through the rest of this year in terms of the lower levels of manual revenue, which again very low margin right so. Mark Begor : Fairly low revenue. John Gamble : And fairly low revenue. So we'll see an impact from that if we go through the rest of this year, but we continue to expect to see nice out performance in the mortgage market. Heather Balsky : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Toni Kaplan : Thanks very much. One of your competitors launched a product this week that allows consumers to choose to share their employment information directly from their payroll provider, and this is a model that's been in the market obviously. I guess, do you see the market moving more that way in the future or parts of the market moving that way? And is there any benefit for you to offer that type of model in addition to your traditional model or does that not make sense for you? Thanks. Mark Begor : We have a solution that does much of that Toni. We just see it, that there's a ton of friction for the customer, whether it's a mortgage originator, an auto lender, and a lot of friction for the consumer. And remember, if you think about our data set, the 161 million records that we have today or 120 million SSNs, you know that's against 160 million non-form payroll. So in non-form there's 40 million people not in our data set that are out getting mortgages and doing other products. And then when you add pension and the self-employed individuals, there's another call it close to $100 million in total. So the solution that was announced, it\u2019s actually been in the market \u2013 I think Experian had that in the marketplace for quite some time. I'm not sure what kind of traction they're getting with it, but we just find that if there's an instant record available, it's always going to trump any of these friction filled processing, where the consumer has to put their user id and password in. In this example, the consumer would have to give there, in my case Equifax HR user id and password in order to get to my payroll records, in my sit, in my case, and most consumers that are employed in W-2 non-form payroll would have to provide those credentials if you will in order to get to that. That's against our company policy and every company policy. So there's just a ton of friction and then it's just the consumers required to do it. Where I believe there is value in some of these alternative solutions and as we talked earlier on the call, we have a manual verification team where we do manual for our customers. There\u2019s another version of what you're talking about, is in the records that we don't have. So think about the, call it $40 million non-form payroll, the $30 million to $40 million self-employed, the $20 million to $30 million pensioners. Those records, if they are not doing a solution with Equifax like our manual or our conventional solution or something like we described, it's being done manually by the company, whether it's a mortgage originator, auto lender, you pick your solution. So it's replacing that manual to really drive speed. That's where there's value in it, but just - it's very very hard to get a lot of penetration with these solutions because of the significant friction for the consumer. And my view and what we see in the market place is it won't replace instant records. Toni Kaplan : Yes, that makes sense. I want to ask about the technology transformation and the potential revenue opportunities. So I think about it in two ways. So one, sort of faster new product introduction and you're already seeing that with the 14% Vitality Index and that was greater than last year too. Like are you already getting some benefits from the technology transformation or should we expect that to really even accelerate next year. And then I think the other benefit is the being always on and I guess I'm not sure how to quantify that benefit, either like how frequently are you not on today and sort of what's the incremental from always being on thanks. Mark Begor : I think you're nailing at Toni about the two elements. And so on the first one you talk about really new product rollouts. The ability to roll out new products, and remember when you think about the 14 for Equifax, remember there's a bifurcation of where the different businesses are. USIS is well below the 14, because they haven't completed the cloud yet. EWS is well above 14, because they completed the cloud and are really driving those new products, and international is slightly south of the 10 or the 14. So as the businesses complete the cloud, particularly USIS and international, we would expect them to move towards the 10%, which is going to be a good thing, it's going to drive new solution there. So that's clearly one of the benefit to the cloud is the ability to leverage those scale differentiated data assets to bring more new solutions to market, and allow us to deliver long term that 10% vitality goal. Your second point is an excellent one also, and in my view it's going to be more impactful in USIS and international. Although EWS is getting real benefits of being in a cloud environment and how they're able to operate their business. The always on stability is clearly a benefit for them. The bigger benefit for Workforce is the ability to scale their data assets. There's no way they could have doubled in the last five years their twin data records without the cloud, period. It just is no way and we've gone \u2013 I think in 2018 we had something like 300,000 employers contributing to the data set, last quarter was 2.8 million. It wouldn't have happened without the cloud. So that that's another benefit of the ability to manage data that's more Workforce oriented. On the benefits of always on and faster data transmission, we believe that that's going to result in market share games. And particularly in USIS and international, where their credit file business is typically a customer will have a primary and secondary as you know. And we would expect by being always on, we're going to be a more valuable partner and allow us to move where we're tertiary or secondary into those secondary and primary positions. And I mentioned in my comments that we have deal pipelines in USIS where customers are talking to us about moving our market position, because of our investment in the cloud. Now, when will that show up in USIS revenue? Likely in \u201824 and \u201825 and \u201826 as they get you know post cloud completion and the same thing should happen in international markets where you've got that same dynamic of a customer using us and one of the other guys. We're going to be a more valuable partner being always on. Toni Kaplan : Super. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Ashish Sabadra of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Q \u2013 Ashish Sabadra : Hi! Just wanted to ask on the OS mortgage business where the out performance compared to inquiry was much wider compared to the first quarter. There was common tree in the prepared calls around improved pricing, but I was just wondering if there was another step up in pricing in the second quarter or was this more driven by mix or other tailwinds. Mark Begor : Yes, truly carry over the pricing comment was really for both businesses. EWS did their normal one-one price increase that's just carrying through. But so no incremental price increase, we have no intention to do that. We basically focus on doing annual price increase in all our businesses. As you may remember back in January or February in the earnings call, we talked about a larger price increase in USIS related to one of our partners who has a credit score and everyone knows who I'm talking about, its FICO, who put through a price increase in both Equifax and Experian deliver that price increase to the marketplace when they increase the price of their credit score. So that holds through in mortgage is what we're talking about, a fairly sizable pricing crease that we mark up to maintain our margins and there's no change in that, that's just rolling through the year. John Gamble : And if your comparing first quarter to second quarter. The full effect of the price increase Market talking about didn't impact the first quarter, but it did the second quarter. Q \u2013 Ashish Sabadra : Yes, that's very helpful color. And then maybe just on the background screener side, have you seen any change in their use of the waterfall model or any change in the market dynamics there? Thanks. Mark Begor : Yes, I think we talked about the big market macro of less hiring taking place in \u201820. It really started two, three quarters ago. It started in the second half of 2022 when you saw companies announcing hiring freezes and layoffs and that's carried through the second quarter. That's kind of the macro that's taking place. The real opportunity for us is that we have fairly low market share of using our instant data, whether it's employment or education, our new education solution, newer education solution, for background screen. So that's where we're rolling out new products and you\u2019re working to add new customers and get them to convert from doing manual employment verification to using our instant solution. Q \u2013 Ashish Sabadra : That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Seth Weber of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Seth Weber : Hey! Good morning guys. Mark, you mentioned the resumption of student loans that's expected to pinch credit scores, maybe weigh on consumer balance sheets. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about the timing of that rolling through? If there was a lag effect and any dynamics between prime and subprime categories? Thanks. Mark Begor : Yes, I think as you know, there's a lot of political elements to that. That has somewhat been episodic as far as announcements and then legal challenges on it. If it happens, it would be in the second half. As you point out, it will put pressure on some of the balance sheets or operating statements, operating available income for some of those recipients. It does skew to subprime consumers. So to put more pressure on those that have outstanding student debt that's been on pause for a couple of years if that actually does get resumed. I personally think it'll be absorbable inside of the kind of economic environment that we have. What's positive for those impacted consumers is that there are individuals, most of them working. So they still have \u2013 in this employment environment they've got you know jobs and they'll have to adjust likely they're spending behavior. It may crimp their ability or desire to get new credit, but it should be a fairly small portion of the full population. Seth Weber : Got it, thank you. And then maybe just a quick follow-up for John. I think the \u2013 just looking at your margin guidance for the year, the international segment, I think the guide for the full year implies the fourth quarter is north of 30%. Is that the right way to think about it? And is there something going on there that creates this kind of hockey stick move in the back half the year, in the fourth quarter. Thanks. Mark Begor : I think all the business. John, I\u2019ll let you jump in, but as you know international, USIS and EWS are a part of the cloud and broader cost restructuring program that we increased by $10 million in the second half. So all the businesses, that's primarily second half oriented. There wasn't much in the first quarter of that cost program, there was some in the second, but it really picks up steam in the third and fourth so which is why we have to carry over benefit in 2024 that will be a good positive for us next year. Would you add anything on international specifically? John Gamble : No, we are expecting to see nice improvement in international margins. I think the number you're quoting might be a little lofty. But we are expecting to see nice improvement in international margins and it's driven by the fact that they are driving revenue improvements. They generally get stronger revenue in the fourth quarter. We are expecting that to continue and they are doing a really nice job as Mark said on cost on cost management. So those are the drivers. Seth Weber : Got it, okay. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. George Tong : Hi! Thanks. Good morning. In EWS you talked about how mortgage originators are taking some of their manual verifications in-houses as volumes come down. Can you talk about in sourcing trends you're seeing in the non-mortgage business in response to volume and/or pricing trends? Mark Begor : George, are you talking about like in auto or background screening or government, what? George Tong : Yes, non-mortgage broadly, in non-government, non-mortgage. Mark Begor : Maybe quite simply is we're not. We are not seeing any impact of kind of in sourcing if you will income or employment verifications in non-mortgage. And the mortgage piece is really quite specifically around the manual operation that we have in Iowa. We saw some pressures around us reducing \u2013 requests from customers for us to reduce our pricing which would impact our margins, which are thinner if you will there than they are instant verifications, because they have capacity to do the manual verifications in house and we decided to let those move in house, but not on the instant side and not in the non-mortgage. George Tong : Got it. And you mentioned a strength in the USI business from increased shopping activity. Can you elaborate on some of the trends you're seeing there and how sustainable that shopping activity is? Mark Begor : As George, we've been talking about it for, I don't know four, five quarters. As rates were coming up, we're just seeing consumers spent more time shopping around for mortgages, and as you know, every time they click on mortgage originator website, that mortgage originator will generally before they spend much time responding they have to understand who that consumer is so they pull a credit file to see whether they are going to qualify. So that is clearly a change in behavior than call it the low interest rate environment we had in 1920 and \u201821 and the early parts of \u201922, where consumers were really just taking the first mortgage they clicked on, because it was lower than their existing mortgage and a refi or met their expectations. They are just more shopping in this higher interest rate environment, which does benefit USIS. And as you know George, the EWS is generally \u2013 there's multiple pulls by EWS. There is more polls on the credit file side. But EWS is generally in the closed mortgages where they see their activity when they get further into the pipeline versus that early shopping behavior. And this is just really a prequel that the mortgage originator is doing to see whether \u2013 you know how much effort they're going to put into it and really how can they respond to that consumer about what they might qualify for. George Tong : Got it. Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Burns for closing comments. Trevor Burns : Thanks everybody. If you have any follow-up questions, let me and Sam know, we'd like to get on the phone. Otherwise have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect your lines or logoff the webcast at this time and enjoy the rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello and welcome to the Equifax Q3 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Trevor Burns, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Investor Relations. Trevor, please go ahead. Trevor Burns : Thanks and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Trevor Burns. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the IR Calendar section of the News & Events tab at our IR website investor.equifax.com. During the call today we'll be making reference to certain materials that can also be found in the Presentation section of the News & Events tab at our IR website. These materials are labeled 3Q 2023 earnings conference call. Also, we\u2019ll be making certain forward-looking statements, including fourth quarter and full-year 2023 guidance to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain Risk Factors that may impact our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2022 Form 10-K and subsequent filings.  We will also be referring certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. Recently Equifax reached an agreement with the UK Financial Conduct Authority in relation to the 2017 cyber security incident. In connection with the agreement Equifax taken the charge in the third quarter of $14 million which is excluded from third quarter adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. These non-GAAP financial measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included in our earnings release and can be found in our financial results section of the financial info tab at our IR website. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark. Mark Begor : Thanks, Trevor and good morning. Turning to Slide 4, we continue to face a very challenging U.S. mortgage market that weakened substantially in August and September beyond our July framework with mortgage rates moving above 7% and now approaching almost 8% over a 20 year high. Revenue in the third quarter was 1.32 billion, was up 6% on a reported basis, 6.5% on a constant currency basis, and 3.5% on an organic, constant currency basis. An adjusted EPS of $1.76 per share was up 2% versus last year. In the quarter BVS, the Brazilian credit bureau that we acquired in August had revenue of 23 million and contributed $0.02 per share to adjusted EPS, which was not in our July framework for the third quarter.  Overall, Equifax revenue of 1.32 billion was $34 million below the midpoint of the guidance we provide in July, which excluded Brazil, driven primarily by the weaker U.S. mortgage market and FX. Together, these items impacted revenue by about $28 million and adjusted EPS by about $0.10 per share. Adjusting for the mortgage markets and FX impact, revenue in the third quarter would have been just below the midpoint of our July framework, and both adjusted EPS and EBITDA margins would have exceeded the framework we provided in July.  Overall mortgage market volumes, measured based on our credit and TWN inquiry volumes, we are on the order of 650 basis points weaker than we expected in our July guidance. Mortgage rates increased substantially during the quarter, with a 100 basis point increase in the ten-year Treasury rate, driving mortgage rates to almost 7.5% in September. The mortgage volume decline negatively impacted mortgage revenue by about 22 million, and the strengthening dollar negatively impacted revenue versus our July expectations by about $6 million. The U.S. mortgage revenue from EWS and USIS was down about 8%, reflecting the significantly weaker mortgage market conditions. Mortgage outperformance relative to the mortgage industry volumes I referenced remains strong in both USIS at over 30% and EWS at 22%.  Non-mortgage constant dollar revenue was up a strong 11% in the quarter and was up 8% excluding revenue from BVS, against a strong 20% growth last year. Non-mortgage constant dollar organic growth was up 7% versus last year with our non-mortgage growth rate strengthening 300 basis points sequentially from the second quarter. Non-mortgage growth was led by EWS that was up over 11% and up 800 basis points sequentially. And USIS that was up almost 8.5% and up 50 bps sequentially. International organic non-mortgage revenue growth at 3% was slightly weaker than our expectations, principally due to lower revenue in our UK debt management business.  We had another very strong quarter in new product growth with a record 15% vitality index, which is well above our 10% long-term growth framework for NPIs. As I referenced earlier, despite the much lower than expected mortgage revenue in the third quarter, we delivered adjusted EPS of $1.76 per share and adjusted EBITDA margins of 33.1%. Excluding BVS we delivered adjusted EPS of $1.74 and adjusted EBITDA margins of 33.3%, up 60 bps sequentially, both in line with the guidance we provided in July, while absorbing the significant impact of the $22 million of lower mortgage revenue. The impact of lower mortgage revenue and FX negatively impacted adjusted EPS by about $0.10 per share. We delivered very good execution against our $210 million cloud and broader spending reduction programs, which allowed us to grow margins sequentially in the quarter despite the lower mortgage revenue. We continue to expect to deliver spending reductions of $210 million in 2023, with 120 million benefiting operating expenses and over 65 million of incremental run rate savings in 2024. We also continue to make good progress on completing our cloud transformation with large North American customers migrating to the cloud during the quarter. We expect both USIS and Canada to complete their credit exchange cloud migrations in the first half of 2024. At the end of the quarter, about 75% of North American revenue was being delivered from the new Equifax Cloud. We are convinced that our Equifax Cloud single data fabric and AI capabilities will provide a competitive advantage to Equifax in the future.  As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect revenue of 1.317 billion, adjusted EPS of $1.77, and adjusted EBITDA margins of 34% at the midpoint of our guidance ranges. This includes about 38 million of revenue from BVS, which adds about 3% to our revenue growth. We expect fourth quarter revenue will be up 10% with organic constant dollar growth of 7%, adjusted EPS to be up over 16%, and adjusted EBITDA margins will expand about 300 basis points versus last year. Non-mortgage constant dollar growth is expected to be strong at about 13%, with organic growth of about 9% led by EWS which should deliver over 15% non-mortgage growth. However, excluding BVS, this framework is about $70 million below the implied fourth quarter revenue guidance of $1.35 billion at the midpoint we provided in July. The sharp decline in the mortgage market and FX drive the majority or about $60 million of this decline. Our guidance assumes that substantially weakening trends in the U.S. mortgage market that we're currently seeing continue through the remainder of the year, and that we also see normal seasonal mortgage declines in November and December. On this basis, we're assuming U.S. mortgage credit inquiries will be down about 22% in the fourth quarter, driving a reduction in overall mortgage volumes of about 18 percentage points versus the guidance implied for the fourth quarter in our July framework. This negatively impacts mortgage revenue in the fourth quarter by about $47 million. At these levels, U.S. mortgage activity will be down an unprecedented more than 50% from 2015 to 29 averages, which we consider to be normal mortgage market levels.  We expect FX to negatively impact revenue in the fourth quarter versus our July guidance by $13 million. The net impact of the $70 million reduction in revenue is driving the reduction in EPS and EBITDA margin from our original fourth quarter goals of $2 a share and 36%, respectively. The second half of 2023 has clearly been very challenging as the accelerated decline in the U.S. mortgage market in August and September, as well as FX negatively impacted revenue by almost $90 million. Like many, we are struggling to forecast the bottom of the mortgage market in this unprecedented environment of fed rate increases, driving mortgage rates up over 2X to 20 year highs in such a short 20-month time frame.  Outside the unprecedented mortgage market decline, we are executing extremely well. As I'll cover in the remainder of my remarks, we are delivering accelerated non mortgage growth, executing on our cloud customer migrations and overall cost plans, outperforming our expectations for new products. and adding new EWS record partnerships and records at an accelerated pace adding over 25 million records since the beginning of last year. In both our mortgage and non-mortgage businesses, we are continuing to outgrow our underlying markets.  Before I cover our business unit results in more detail, I wanted to provide a brief overview of what we're seeing in the U.S. economy and consumer. Outside of the challenging U.S. mortgage market, the U.S. consumer and our customers remain broadly resilient. Employment remains at record historic levels with low unemployment and about 10 million open jobs against about 5 million people who are looking for jobs. Excess consumer savings built up during the pandemic still exist, however, have declined to the lowest levels since the second quarter of 2020, particularly amongst lower and middle income households. Credit card utilization is increasing, credit card delinquency rates for prime consumers which represent about 20% of the market are stable but are above pre-pandemic levels in less than 1%. However, subprime borrower delinquencies which have been increasing over the past year are now above pre-pandemic levels and approaching the levels we saw in 2009 and 2010. Auto delinquency rates for prime consumers, which represent about 20% of the market, are also stable but above pre-pandemic levels and still well below 1%. Delinquencies for subprime consumers are above pre-pandemic levels as well above levels that we saw in 2009 and 2010. And any customer credit tightening has largely been in fintech and subprime, which started over a year ago. Overall, still a solid market for Equifax outside of mortgage and hiring. When consumers are working, they largely have the capacity to keep current on their financial obligations. Turning to Slide 5, overall workforce solutions revenue was up 3% in the quarter, a return to growth, which is a very positive sign as we look towards 2024. Strong TWN record growth, the positive impact of 2023 price actions, and strong NPI performance driven by the adoption of mortgage trended data drove a strong 22 points of mortgage outperformance again in the quarter. EWS had another very strong quarter of record additions with an incremental 2 million current records added to the TWN database. EWS closed the third quarter with 163 million current records on 121 million unique individuals or SSNs, which was up 12% and 9% respectively versus last year. Total records, both current and historic are now over 640 million and we now have current records on over 70% of U.S. non-farm payroll and over 50% of the 220 million people in the U.S. with employment and income records relevant to the TWN database. The EWS team has acquired over 11 million records so far in 2023 that are driving top line growth and will significantly benefit Verifier Revenue Growth when the U.S. mortgage and white-collar hiring markets recover.  During the quarter, we signed agreements with four new payroll processors that will deliver records in the fourth quarter in 2024 and over the past three years, we've added partnerships with 27 payroll processors. As a reminder, about 50% of our records are contributed directly by individual employers from our employer services customer relationships. The remaining 50% are contributed through partnerships with payroll processors, HR software companies, pension administrators, and other relationships. Increasingly, more of our new products are incorporating both current and historical records with about 50% of our third quarter verification services revenue, as well as about 50% of our mortgage verification services revenue coming from products that include historical records.  Turning to Slide 6, Workforce Solutions delivered strong non-mortgage revenue growth of 11%, a return to double-digit revenue growth with a growth rate up about 800 basis points sequentially. And as a reminder, EWS non-mortgage revenue was up a very strong 40% in the third quarter last year, which of course, was a very tough comp. Verification services non-mortgage revenue, which represents just under 70% of Verifier Revenue, delivered 11% growth versus last year in the quarter. This was also against a very challenging 72% non-mortgage growth comp last year. In government, we saw a continued very strong growth with revenue up 23% compared to over 90% revenue growth last year in the third quarter. Government revenue was slightly lower than our expectations due to timing of Medicaid redetermination volumes. We continue to expect that EWS will capture significant volume from these redeterminations as they complete prior to the end of the second quarter of next year. During the quarter, we signed a contract extension to provide income verification to the U.S. centers for Medicare and Medicaid services as a part of a contract valued at up to $1.2 billion over the next five years. This contract is the largest in Equifax's history and extends our services via healthcare.gov for ACA related determinations while allowing workforce solutions to continue to work to penetrate the state level Medicaid verification services market. Also during the quarter, USDA's Food and Nutrition Service awarded a national contract to Equifax Workforce Solutions to provide verification services in support of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as SNAP. The award is for $38 million in the base year, which we began on September 30th with a potential total contract value of $190 million. These large new EWS government contracts reflect the uniqueness of the TWN data supporting the delivery of social services at the U.S. federal, state, and local level.  These new contracts give us confidence in strong future EWS growth in the large 4 billion TAM for our government vertical. We expect to see accelerating sequential growth in our government vertical in the fourth quarter, driven by growth from CMS Medicaid Redeterminations, ACA open enrollment volume, further state government penetration, and pricing from state contract renewals, as well as revenue from the new SNAP agreement with the USDA.  Talent Solutions was up 6% in the quarter versus a very strong over 110% growth last year in the third quarter from record levels of U.S. hiring. As a reminder, we are currently more heavily penetrated to white-collar workers, including technology, professional services, healthcare, and financial services, which has seen a greater reduction in hiring activity and broader hiring freezes and about 10% decline that the BLS reported in the third quarter through August. We outperformed the hiring market by about 20 percentage points in the quarter as we delivered new digital solutions and background screening, strong new product growth, continued expansion of TWN records and pricing. Employer services revenue of 118 million was up 13%, driven by growth in our I9 and onboarding businesses despite the negative impact of U.S. hiring, as well as growth in our ACA business. In the fourth quarter, we expect overall employer services revenue to decline slightly as growth in I9 and onboarding is offset by declines in ERC revenue as the U.S. government has suspended processing new ERC claims.  Earlier this year, we announced the launch of PeopleHQ, a workforce solutions cloud native solution that brings together multiple best in class employer compliance services and a single unified customer experience. PeopleHQ will help companies of all sizes access EWS employer services, including income verification, I9, and ACA from our new self-service portal. Since the launch of PeopleHQ in the first quarter, EWS has onboarded about 45,000 companies, which also delivers new records for TWN. Workforce Solutions' adjusted EBITDA margin of 50.9% was up 140 basis points versus last year, but down 60 basis points from the second quarter from the mortgage market decline. The EWS team continue to perform very well despite the macro headwinds from mortgage and U.S. hiring, outperforming their underlying markets from strong TWN record growth, penetration, new products, and price. As shown on Slide 7, USIS revenue of 426 million was up over 7% and down slightly from our expectations due to the impact of the much weaker mortgage market. USIS delivered strong non-mortgage revenue growth of about 8% in the quarter. USIS mortgage revenue was up 4% and outperformed the mortgage credit inquiries that were down 29% by 33 points. The strong pricing environment that we discussed in July drove very strong outperformance. At 101 million, mortgage revenue was 24% of total USIS revenue in the quarter. B2B non-mortgage online revenue growth was up a very strong 10% total and up 5% organically. During the quarter, online revenue had strong double-digit growth in commercial and banking and lending from strong identity and fraud revenue and mid-single-digit growth in auto and insurance, offset by declines in telco and direct-to-consumer. USIS also saw a strong double-digit growth in count from very good new business and NPI performance.  Financial marketing services, our B2B offline business had revenue of 51 million that was down just under 1%. In marketing, declines in pre-screen marketing revenue in the quarter that were consistent with declines in the first half, more than offset nice revenue growth from our IXI consumer wealth data business. In pre-screen, we continue to see weakness with the smaller FIs and Fintechs in the subprime space, offset by growth with larger FIs. Within risk and account reviews, we did see limited growth in our portfolio review business, but we have not seen a meaningful increase in risk-based portfolio reviews that are typical during challenging economic periods. USIS consumer solutions D2C business had another very strong quarter with revenue of $56 million of 12% from very good performances in both our consumer direct and our indirect channels. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 34.2% in the quarter and slightly below the 35% we had guided from the impact of weaker mortgage market as well as higher technology spend as we migrate customers to the new cloud data fabric. Todd and USIS team are on offense as they work to complete their cloud transformation and pivot to leveraging their new cloud capability to deliver new products and drive share gains. In the third quarter, USIS onboarded a new large FI customer to our new cloud platform, which you expect to deliver share gains moving forward.  Turning to Slide 8, international revenue was 316 million, up 12% in constant currency and up 3% in organic constant currency, and below the 4.5% growth we had guided to in July due to the greater decline in our European debt collection revenue than we expected. Europe local currency revenue was down 2% in the quarter. Our UK and Spain CRA business revenue was up a very strong 8% in the quarter, a very good performance offset by the weaker than expected 17% decline in our UK debt management business. We expect Europe to deliver almost 10% growth in the fourth quarter from continued strength in the CRA business and a return to growth in our debt management business as we lacked difficult comps from last year. Latin America, local currency revenue, including Brazil, was up a very strong 21% comping off a very strong 34% growth in the third quarter of last year driven by double digit growth in Argentina and Paraguay and from new product introductions and pricing actions. We expect LATAM to deliver strong double digit revenue growth again in the fourth quarter. Canada and Asia Pacific both delivered low single digit growth in the quarter as we expected. International adjusted EBITDA margins of 26.3% were up 210 basis points sequentially. Excluding Brazil adjusted EBITDA margins of 26.8% were up 260 basis points and in line with our expectations. The improvement was driven by revenue growth and good execution against their 2023 cost reduction plans by Lisa and our international team.  Turning to Slide 9, in the third quarter overall non-mortgage constant dollar revenue growth grew a strong 11% with organic growth of 7%, both inside our long-term framework. Positively, this was up 300 basis points sequentially. The acceleration in organic revenue growth was driven by strong 11% EWS non-mortgage growth and improvement of about 800 basis points sequentially. As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect non-mortgage revenue growth to be about 13% with organic growth of about 9% above the levels we delivered in the third quarter. The acceleration organic growth is expected to be led again by EWS with growth of over 15% driven by their government and talent businesses.  Turning to Slide 10, new product introductions leveraging our differentiated data and new AFX cloud are central to our EFX 2025 growth strategy. In the quarter, we delivered a record 15% vitality again led by very strong performances in EWS and Latin America. EWS non-mortgage VI in the quarter was over 25%, a very strong performance. And in the third quarter, about 85% of new product revenue came from non-mortgage products leveraging the EFX Cloud. Leveraging our new EFX cloud capabilities to drive new product rollouts, we expect to deliver vitality index of approximately 14% in 2023, which is about 400 basis points above our 10% long-term vitality index goal. Importantly second half USIS VI is expected to be up about a 100 bps higher than first half as we are closer to cloud completion and able to leverage our new cloud native infrastructure in USIS for innovation and new products. This is broadly positive momentum for 2024. On the right side of this slide we've highlighted several new products introduced in the quarter. These new solutions are a testament to the power of the Equifax Cloud and AI in driving innovation that increase -- that can increase the visibility of consumers to help expand access to credit and create new mainstream financial products while driving Equifax's top line. Turning to Slide 11, we're very excited to have closed the Boa Vista AC acquisition in early August and welcome the Boa Vista team to Equifax. We're focused on driving growth in Brazil and expanding BVS's capabilities by deploying our cloud-based decisioning and analytical products, as well as expanding in new verticals like identity and fraud. In the third quarter for the period after our acquisition closed on August 7th, EFX Brazil delivered revenue of $23 million and was accretive to adjusted EPS by $0.02 per share. Going forward, Brazil will be included in our Latin American region for reporting, and as a reminder, we expect Brazil to deliver approximately 160 million in run rate revenue to Equifax to be accretive to adjusted EPS in its first year. And now I'd like to turn over to John to provide more detail on our fourth quarter and full year guidance. John. John W. Gamble, Jr.: Thanks, Mark. Turning to Slide 12, as Mark mentioned, third quarter mortgage market credit inquiries were down about 29% weaker than the down 23% in our July guidance and EWS mortgage outperformance was about 22% from records and price product and mix, and consistent with the second quarter. For the fourth quarter, we are assuming the weakening trend in mortgage market volume estimated based on the change in our credit inquiries we have seen in October continues as well as further normal seasonal declines in November and December. On this basis, we expect mortgage credit inquiries to be down about 22% in the fourth quarter, which is an 18 percentage point reduction from our July framework for the fourth quarter. For perspective, to the extent the mortgage market continues at the levels we've assumed for 4Q 2023, which is more than 50% below pre-pandemic averages, 2024 mortgage market credit inquiry volumes would be down approaching 15% versus 2023. Slide 13 provides the details of our guidance for 4Q 2023. In 4Q 2023, we expect total Equifax revenue to be between $1.307 billion and $1.327 billion with revenue up 10% at the midpoint. Non-mortgage constant currency revenue growth should strengthen to 13%. Mortgage revenue in the fourth quarter is expected to be below 15% of Equifax revenue. Business unit performance in the fourth quarter is expected to be as described below. Workforce Solutions revenue growth is expected to be up about 8%, which is lower than the implied fourth quarter framework we outlined in July. The bulk of the $47 million mortgage market impact on revenue that Mark referenced impacts EWS. As we discussed in July USIS benefits from greater mortgage revenue in the early application phases, which should continue into the fourth quarter.  EWS non-mortgage revenue will return to strong over 15% growth year-to-year in the fourth quarter. However, this strong growth is below our framework from July. Government growth should be above the 23% we saw in the third quarter, but is below our framework from July as state benefit redeterminations are occurring at a slower pace than we anticipated. Talent growth should be above the 6% we saw this quarter as well, but will also be below our July framework as overall hiring has decelerated from the levels we were seeing in July with BLS now down 10% with white collar verticals down significantly more. And employer services revenue will be below our 4Q framework from July for both I9 and onboarding that should continue to deliver year-to-year growth but at levels below our July framework from weaker overall hiring and ERC with the IRS announcement that they would pause on new ERC claims. Adjusted EBITDA margins for EWS are expected to be about 50.5%.  USIS revenue is expected to be up about 4% year-to-year despite the increased mortgage headwind. Non-mortgage year-to-year revenue growth of 4% should be down from the about 8.5% growth we saw this quarter as we lap 4Q 2022 pricing actions. This is somewhat stronger than we expected in our July framework driven by continued good growth in commercial, consumer solutions, auto, and across our account IB [ph] products. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be about 35%, up sequentially, principally due to revenue growth and cost actions. International revenue is expected to be up about 20% in constant currency due to the addition of BVS and as we lap headwinds in our UK debt management business. Revenue is expected to be up about 6.5% in organic constant currency, this is somewhat stronger than our July framework. EBITDA margins are expected to be about 30%, reflecting revenue growth and strong cost management, including the benefit of planned cost reduction actions. We expect Brazil to deliver revenue of about $38 million in the fourth quarter. Equifax 4Q 2023 adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be about 34% at the midpoint of our guidance, an increase sequentially of almost 100 basis points. And adjusted EPS in 4Q 2023 is expected to be $1.72 to $1.82 per share, up 17% versus 4Q 2022 at the midpoint. Both adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA margin are below the $2 per share and 36% targets that we set as goals as we entered 2023, principally due to the assumed further decline in mortgage market volumes and associated reduction of high-margin mortgage revenue that Mark discussed. Slide 14 provides the specifics of our 2023 full year guidance. 2023 revenue and adjusted EPS are being reduced consistent with our 3Q 2023 results and our 4Q 2023 guidance. We expect 2023 non-mortgage constant currency revenue growth to be strong at about 9% and organic revenue growth of about 7%. Total capital spending for 2023, including the addition of Brazil, which was not previously included in our guidance, is expected to be about $580 million. Capital spending in the third quarter was about $145 million. We did see the expected decline in spending sequentially, however, the reduction was slightly less than the expected, principally due to higher spending related to customer migrations. We expect capital spending in the fourth quarter to decline sequentially by about $15 million as we continue to progress U.S. and Canadian migrations to Data Fabric. We remain focused on reducing CAPEX as a percentage of revenue to about 7% by the end of 2025.  We remain focused on executing our long-term model, delivering 8% to 12% revenue growth with 50-plus basis points of margin expansion annually on average over a cycle. Although the unprecedented decline in the U.S. mortgage market in 2022 and 2023, pushes out our prior midterm goal of $7 billion in revenue and 39% EBITDA margins to beyond 2025, it does not change our focus on expanding our margins toward our 39% goal as we drive revenue higher. We will continue to focus on delivering strong non-mortgage growth at or above our long-term revenue growth framework, outperforming our underlying markets, including the mortgage market, and executing our cloud transformation, including delivering ongoing cost improvements. As mentioned earlier, to the extent the mortgage market continues at the levels we have assumed for 4Q 2023, 2024 mortgage market inquiry volumes would be down approaching 15% versus 2023. Now I'd like to turn it back over to Mark. Mark Begor : Thanks, John. Wrapping up, Equifax delivered on its earnings guidance in the third quarter with adjusted EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS within our guidance range despite the challenging U.S. mortgage market. While the mortgage market was down significantly again, our non-mortgage businesses delivered strong constant dollar organic growth of 7% and overall growth of 11%, including BVS. Importantly, EWS returned a strong 11% non-mortgage growth and USIS delivered a strong over 8% non-mortgage quarter. We expect our strong third quarter constant dollar non-mortgage revenue of 11% to accelerate in the fourth quarter to about 13%, including EWS, above 15% and international, including BVS at about 20%. The breadth and depth of our non-mortgage businesses, which account for about 81% of Equifax revenue in the third quarter and execution against our 2023 cloud and broader spending reduction program, allowed us to deliver against our earnings guidance despite the decline in the mortgage market. While it's early to provide 2024 guidance, I wanted to give you a perspective on how we plan to operate in 2024 in what could be another challenging year from a macro perspective as we exit 2023 with U.S. mortgage volumes at historically low levels with record mortgage rates. We remain committed to executing against our EFX 2025 strategy with a focus on things we can control. As we move towards 2024, we're focused on : first, continuing above-market non-mortgage growth inside our 8% to 12% long-term framework and outperforming the underlying mortgage market. Second, substantially completing our cloud transformation in 2024 with revenue from our new cloud platforms approaching 90% by the end of the year, which will be a big milestone to allow our team to pivot to fully focus on innovation and growth. Third, as we complete our cloud investments, we expect CAPEX to move towards our long-term goal of 7% of revenue in 2025 and our CAPEX spend to pivot from maintenance and cloud investments to innovation and new products.  Aligned with our cloud technology completion, we will continue to execute against the cloud and broader spending reduction program we announced in February, which we expect to deliver $65 million of 2023 carryover next year with additional cost savings next year as we complete the cloud. Our 14% vitality performance in the second half of this year gives us strong momentum as we move towards 2024. We will continue our focus on new product innovation using our single data fabric, cloud capabilities, and AI to bring new models and scores to the market, including a focus on bringing EWS and USIS assets much closer together with a long-term annual vitality goal of 10%. We'll focus on adding new ERB records to further strengthen the TWN data set, including the acquisition of traditional W-2 pension and 1099 records.  And last, we'll continue to look for financially attractive bolt-on M&A aligned with our strategic priorities around differentiated data, strengthening EWS, and identity and fraud. Despite the challenges of an unprecedented decline in the U.S. mortgage market, Equifax demonstrated in 2022 and 2023 that we can grow revenue as we outperform our underlying markets over the last two years from above-market non-mortgage growth, outperforming the mortgage market, vertical penetration, new product innovation, adding new records to TWN, and pricing. We are committed to delivering on our long-term framework of 8% to 12% revenue growth and 50 basis points of annual margin expansion as well as our medium-term goal of 39% EBITDA margins. And when the mortgage market recovers, we are poised to generate accelerated above-market growth and margin expansion from investments we have made in our cloud technology, new products, TWN record additions, and expanding our unique data assets. During the next chapter of the new Equifax as we pivot from building the new Equifax cloud to leveraging our new cloud capabilities to drive our top and bottom line. We are convinced that our new Equifax cloud-based technology, differentiated data assets in our new single data fabric, and market-leading businesses will deliver higher growth, expanded margins and free cash flow in the future. And with that, operator, let me open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is now live. Manav Patnaik : Thank you and good morning. Mark, I just had a question, I think the negative 15%, I guess potential decline in mortgage increase next year based on I guess, your current run rate, seasonality, etcetera. If that is the case, you've obviously been outperforming the market consistently this year, but are there other initiatives you can put in place to potentially outperform further, or just curious on what the strategy in a longer -- weaker for longer, I guess, mortgage market would be? Mark Begor : Yes, Manav, we believe that we have multiple levers in both mortgage and non-mortgage. I'll focus on mortgage because that's your question, to continue to outperform the underlying market. And you've seen us do that over an extended period of time. And we'll talk about USIS and EWS, if you want, because that's a mortgage. In USIS, they obviously have the ability to deliver price, and we expect price to be a part of the levers for 2024. There's new product rollouts inside of USIS. For example, if you recall earlier this year, we rolled out our new mortgage credit report that includes those NC+ attributes. That's going to be a positive for us to outperform the underlying market. And then if you go to EWS, you've got the same two levers there plus more, obviously. Price is an opportunity as we have more records, and we can deliver more value to the mortgage customers. We've got a big focus in more leverage in EWS around new products. You've seen us roll out new solutions like a year ago, mortgage 36 with 36 months' worth of history. So new products will be a continued lever for us in the mortgage space. And of course, records growing records double digit in the quarter, the new payroll processors that we're adding in the fourth quarter and next year that we signed up during the quarter, and of course, our pipeline of new records those drive higher hit rates in the EWS mortgage business, which we expect that to continue going forward. And then the last for EWS quite uniquely, is ability to drive penetration, meaning more usage of the income and employment data inside the mortgage process. And as we've talked before, we don't have -- every customer doesn't use our solutions. Some still use manual verifications and we're driving them to using our verified solution. So yes, we've got confidence about our ability. I wouldn't characterize that we have new levers, but we've got a lot of focus around them. And I think -- when you think about EWS and USIS, and we mentioned it earlier in our prepared comments, as USIS completes the cloud, and of course, EWS is already there, we think the ability to have each business bring new products to market will continue, but the ability to bring solutions that combine the two businesses, data assets for mortgage and non-mortgage with USIS getting into the cloud is another year for us in the future. Manav Patnaik : Okay. Got it. And then just on the margin front, the 34% for the fourth quarter, is that a right run rate to think about as you exit the year, I know you have a lot of, obviously, mortgage headwinds and then cost savings coming in to offset that. And if you could just remind us versus the 39% target that you had, how much of that is going to be a mortgage shortfall in terms of getting to that 39%? Mark Begor : I think first on the 39, we tried to be clear, our goal hasn't changed. As you know, for a couple of years, we carried a goal of 2025 for 39% against $7 billion of revenue. Clearly, that $7 billion is going to be pushed out with the mortgage market decline and we wanted to be transparent today that we view that as being post-2025. But our focus on 39% hasn't changed. We have a path to 39%. In the future, it's going to be beyond 2025 and then post 39%, we still see between operating leverage in the businesses, the strong margins in EWS, the ability to grow 50 basis points per year post that 39%. John W. Gamble, Jr.: And as you're specifically looking at 2024, right, we've already talked about the fact that we have significant cost reduction plans we put in place in 2023. They'll drive an additional $65 million of savings as we get into next year. We also look at some savings as we continue to migrate to the cloud, which weren't included in that $65 million. So we expect to have cost levers that will help drive our margins higher. Obviously, we're not giving revenue guidance but again, for us, for 2024 but for us, as you know, our variable margin on new revenue is very high, right. So as we drive more revenue, that also is a way that we drive margins as we go forward. So just as a reminder, those people think about next year, first quarter margins for us tend to be lower, right, because a significant amount of equity and variable compensation expense hits in the first quarter as opposed to being spread throughout the year because of the structure of our plan. So just as a reminder, first quarter margins tend to move down. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Andrew Steinerman from J.P. Morgan. Your line is now live. Andrew Steinerman : Hi, two quickies. Well, actually, we'll see if it is quick. The first one is, for third quarter, what was mortgage as a percentage of total revenues? And then the second question has to do with, could you just review with us the cadence of Equifax government revenues from the Medicaid redetermination fourth quarter to second quarter. I'm also assuming that it might be higher in total now because you talked about additional state penetration? Mark Begor : I think the first question, John, it was 19%. John W. Gamble, Jr.: 19%, yes. Mark Begor : In the third quarter, that will be lower in the fourth quarter for obvious reasons on the percent of revenue, Andrew from mortgage. On the government one, maybe just a couple of comments on government, and I'll get to redeterminations and John can jump in. We've got a lot of positive levers in government. I hope you saw Andrew had noted that those two large contracts, which we alluded to in July, meaning that we talked about some visibility that we had of new contracts, $1.2 billion and $190 million USDA contracts give us some visibility and momentum in our government vertical, not only in the fourth quarter but also for 2024. Those contracts as well as others also give us the ability to continue our expansion at the state level. As you know, our government vertical inside of EWS is call it roughly $500 million run rate business, but in a $4 billion TAM. So there's a lot of opportunity to add new states and new agencies at the state levels and you might imagine we have a deal pipeline of customers or agencies that we're working on adding at the state level, which is a part of our visibility for fourth quarter and into 2024 for the government vertical. And in particular, the CMS contract is -- and the USDA contract actually are both helpful in the addition of more state-level relationships.  On redeterminations, it's clearly been a very challenging forecasting about when will states actually activate those redeterminations. We saw a strong volume of that in the third quarter. We expect that to continue in the fourth. And then as you point out, in first and second next year, there'll be continued redeterminations because of the time line is to really complete those, I believe, at the end of the second quarter. So we work closely on those, but it has been a bit more challenging to forecast those. Anything you add, John? John W. Gamble, Jr.: Just in terms of pacing, you covered it, right? It's just it's very difficult to forecast, right? So although we did see lift from redeterminations, it wasn't to the level we expected, and we certainly saw that to a degree in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. But we still think we're the best solution and expect to get the revenue related to redeterminations, as Mark said, by the time it completes at the end of the second quarter. But as we said, in the third quarter and certainly in the fourth quarter, a little lower growth than the level we'd expected. Andrew Steinerman : Perfect, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Kelsey Zhu from Autonomous Research. Your line is now live. Kelsey Zhu : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I think on the talent vertical, you talked about 20 percentage point outperformance if I heard that correctly. I was wondering, between the different factors that was driving that 20 percentage outperformance what is the biggest factor and how durable is this 20 percentage point outperformance over the next few quarters? Mark Begor : Yes, the 20% we were pleased with the market -- the business is up 6%, the talent vertical and from our measure, the BLS market was down 10%. We think the white collar market was down double that. So that's how you get close to double that. So that's how you get to the 20 points of outperformance. And there isn't really -- I wouldn't characterize a single lever that's really driving that outperformance. It's really similar in all our businesses. In talent, we've got the ability to drive price, which we do every year. We expect to do that as we go into 2024 in the talent vertical like our others because of the value we're delivering. In talent, quite uniquely, we have the ability to drive penetration. That's a big multibillion dollar TAM in a business that's roughly $400 million at run rate. So there's a lot of customers in talent that are still doing manual verifications of employment history that our 640 million jobs that we have in our database are just immensely valuable from a speed and productivity standpoint. So that's a lever in talent that we think is quite durable along with price. Product is another big one. You've seen us roll out almost every quarter, a couple of new products from EWS and the talent vertical really to get more narrowly focused around products that match kind of job categories. We rolled out an hourly solution, I think, last quarter for hourly workers to try to drive some growth there. So new products are clearly a growth. And then the addition of records. And as you know, with the 50 attributes we get every pay period, we get job title and 75 million people a year or roughly that number change jobs in the United States. So having those new jobs from our record additions every pay period is a very valuable asset that just drives higher hit rates, which drives revenue going forward. So we have a lot of confidence in our ability to outperform the underlying talent market, just like we do with the rest of our markets because of those levers. Kelsey Zhu : Got it. That's super helpful. Thanks so much. My second question is on mortgage. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about the spread between kind of the increased trend versus origination and how you calculate the mortgage outperformance for EWS? Mark Begor : Yes, I'll start and let John jump in. We've been consistent really. There's been a phenomena that's a major change, a meaningful change in the mortgage market over the last, call it, 12 to 18 months, where when rates were starting to increase consumers did a lot more shopping and that benefited our USIS business. Meaning that the consumers would go to multiple mortgage originators and as you know, as a part of that process, when someone applies online, the first thing a mortgage originator will do is determine is that a consumer that can qualify for the loan they're trying to get, meaning are they going to invest that 5,000 or 6,000 or actually 7,000 of COGS in that mortgage process. So there's an inquiry that goes into or a pull on the USIS side. And that's why inquiries versus originations or closed loans have really separated. There's been an increase in originations. And we expect that to continue with these high interest rates. Consumers, they'll be more deliberate around their shopping behavior. And that's why there's a positive, if you will, for USIS in inquiries or credit polls in this environment where EWS typically in the back end of the mortgage process in -- really around closed loans. John W. Gamble, Jr.: Just broadly, right, we're finding it difficult to get good market data that we can correlate across applications and other measures, including originations. So as you know, for USIS, right, we determine our outperformance based on our own internal volume data. And we share that internal volume data, obviously, with you every quarter. And then going forward, what we're going to do is we're going to provide outperformance for EWS also based on our internal volume data, which are actuals, which we can actually measure. And as we've been talking to you about for quite some time, right, our outperformance is driven by record growth, which is more specific to TWN, but then also product price and mix. And as we said in the script, those are things we can measure together, understanding the difference between our volume and our overall revenue. And that's our outperformance. And I think going forward, we'll use that measure because it's all based on internal data that we can validate each quarter. And again, what we -- our internal volume data is transaction volume data, it's the transactions that are related directly to mortgage application approvals, doesn't really include things around batches or monitoring so that the data stays pure. And we feel like that's a much better measure of the level of outperformance driven by record growth, product, pricing and mix that we can deliver each quarter, and we'll continue to share that with you. Mark Begor : Maybe just one more point, John, as a reminder, as you know, we get mortgage originations because we have the credit file on every consumer. So we see the actual new mortgage originations, but they're typically on a what five to six-month lag. So between that five to six-month lag, we're forecasting based on MBA data, based on our own tracking, based on our own run rates, we use multiple inputs to try to forecast those originations. We obviously have been challenged by that in this current environment with interest rates increasing. But we have a lot of data around mortgage originations. Kelsey Zhu : Got it, thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Andrew Jeffrey from Truist Securities. Your line is now live. Andrew Jeffrey : Hi, good morning. Appreciate you taking my questions this morning. Mark, I mean, I get there a lot of moving pieces here outside of mortgage, especially I'm thinking about EWS verifier government, a little bit weaker maybe than you thought and you enumerated the reasons. I guess my question overall is do you think that, that EWS non-verifier -- sorry, non-mortgage verifier business has perhaps gotten a little more difficult to forecast as you do more business with the government and all these different programs, appreciating the new contract wins and do you think you're going to take that into account when you start to think about guiding for 2024? Mark Begor : Yes, for sure. There's no question. Look, it's a big business. It's dealing in multiple verticals. In some regards, these -- like talent in government or I would still characterize them as fairly new verticals for us at scale, we've only been large in those verticals in the last couple of years. And you've got some macro impacts certainly in talent, leave mortgage side, which we talked about a bunch, but the hiring market is obviously under some pressure, particularly in white collar in the U.S. And we've tried to forecast that, and we're going to try to be more conservative or more balanced whatever word you want to use around that vertical. Same with government. There's a lot of moving parts there. I would say the most complex for us or the one we've been challenged by is the redeterminations. Outside of that, we have pretty clear visibility about adding new customers, adding new clients, new product rollouts, pricing actions and government, that is pretty dialed in. And I think the other -- if you think about 2023, both of those businesses had really, really, really strong 2022. So we're comping off very strong years, which is great because we're driving more penetration, more product, more price, and we had to look forward to where we're going to take those businesses. And while we've been off a little bit, we're really pleased with the growth of those businesses. Those are -- they both delivered strong growth in the quarter. You've seen accelerated growth in non-mortgage and EWS from second quarter. We expect that non-mortgage verifier growth to accelerate again in fourth quarter, which gives us really positive momentum going into 2024. But short answer to your question about, are we going to be more balanced around how we forecast there, for sure. Andrew Jeffrey : Okay. Yes, I think the market would welcome that. And then if I could just ask, it feels like obligatory competitive question in EWS. There are a couple of pieces of business that you characterize as manual and low margin that kind of let go last quarter. Can you just sort of reiterate your thinking, especially in mortgage Verifier in terms of the competitiveness of your solution? Mark Begor : Yes. No change from what we talked about in July. In July, we tried to talk about the manual work we were doing for customers when we didn't have records. And that got I think somewhat misconstrued in the marketplace. We're not seeing an impact from competition in our mortgage business or any other businesses. We tried to be clear about that in July, and I'll be clear again today. We're well aware of what our competitors' data records that they have and what they don't have. To me, a big proof point about our competitiveness is our ability to continue to add new partnerships. We added four in the quarter. We added, I think, 27 in the last couple of years. We're growing our records. That's really, I think, a proof point of the strength of our ability to deliver solutions to our partners and execute for them. And they want to be partnered with Equifax. So I think that's a really important metric for us going forward. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Kyle Peterson from Needham & Company. Your line is now live. Kyle Peterson : Great, thanks, good morning guys. And appreciate you taking the questions. I wanted to touch on the consumer lending volumes within EWS. Looks like that was down a bit year-on-year. Just wanted to see, is that fairly broad based or was there any more concentration, whether it's card or personal loan or auto, just any more color would be helpful? Mark Begor : Yes. Maybe at the kind of the macro level about a year ago, we talked about and we continue to talk about subprime really got tightened up. So that happened over the last, call it, three, four, five quarters. That's starting to bottom out because we're comping off really sharp declines from last year as we go into fourth quarter. But subprime has clearly pulled back. A combination of concern around that consumer base being more challenged, not from unemployment, but really from inflation. And we talked earlier that we've seen some delinquencies increase there. And as an old card guy from my prior life, when delinquencies go up, you typically will pull back on originations or be more deliberate around originations, meaning you want to make sure you're finding the consumers that can really afford that financial product. Prime is still fairly strong. The consumers are working, they've had some wage growth, while they've been impacted by inflation. We haven't seen much impact there. And would you add anything, John? John W. Gamble, Jr.: No, just as Mark said, our -- it tends to be in our consumer finance business, right, is that we tend to be more concentrated, we tend to be more concentrated in subprime and more concentrated on specific lenders. So the fact that that we're seeing subprime week, and we're seeing some fintechs week is driving it. And because we have more concentration other than the extremely broad coverage that USIS has, we tend to be -- we tend to move around a little bit more in EWS and our revenue for consumer finance. Kyle Peterson : Got it. That's really helpful. And then just a follow-up, I know you guys have talked a bit about some of the previous spending reductions and kind of the benefits that will be in the 2024 numbers based on the actions taken this year. I just want to see, are there any other funding plans or things you guys are looking at if you guys are -- if we're going to be in kind of a lower-for-longer kind of mortgage inquiry market, I just want to see, are there any more levers you guys can push on the cost side of things if volumes don't come back next year? Mark Begor : Yes. I think as John mentioned, and we did earlier, we had the $65 million of carryover from our $275 million program this year. The bulk of that, as you know, is from cloud completion and cloud cost savings. And as we go through 2024 we mentioned, and we'll give guidance in Feb on that, but we'll have additional cloud cost savings as we complete migrations next year. As we said, we expect to complete USIS and Canada and other of our international platforms. And as a reminder, we're carrying double cost today in those environments where we have a cloud environment we're paying for, and then we also have a legacy environment. When we complete the migrations, we shut down the legacy. So that will be the incremental savings which we expect to have in 2024 and 2025, and we'll give guidance on that. Beyond those kind of savings, we're going to keep our belt tight in 2024. We're going to want to continue to invest in the right places, but I'd characterize that as we're going to be balanced around it given the environment. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Simon Clinch from Redburn. Your line is now live. Simon Clinch : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. A lot of my questions have been asked already, but maybe we could zero in again on EWS mortgage. And I just wanted to -- just going back to your -- the way you're measuring the outperformance this time and the implied decline in origination volumes this quarter that you've seen versus what the sort of industry forecasts have been for third quarter. And there's quite a wide gap. And I just wanted to make sure that there's nothing else at play here in terms of I don't know, maybe sort of just you're not seeing all the volumes that you would otherwise be seeing or for any sort of color you can give around that sort of divergence would be useful? Mark Begor : We try to forecast what the originations are as mentioned earlier. We know what actual originations are like, a five to six-month lag. Between that time frame, we try to forecast. If you're referring to like NBA and some of the other forecasts, if you look back over the last two years, three years, four years, five years, they're consistently long. It's a hard thing to forecast, and we just try to use our best data on it. And then we also factor in our current run rates on originations. So that's the way that we're forecasting to try to get more current because MBA is done on a survey basis. I think they survey like half of the mortgage originators in order to get that data. Ours is actual originations on a lag and then our current forecast based on what we're seeing in current time frame. John W. Gamble, Jr.: And again, going forward, what we're going to try to make sure we do is we're going to make sure we're providing you with actual data, right. So I mean we'll be able to give you the benefit we're seeing from records, product, price and mix which are really the big drivers of our outperformance. And we'll be measuring that against our actual volumes across USIS and TWN separately so that we can validate the information. We know what the actuals are and we can explain how we're performing and driving those levers, which we think is what's really important to make sure we explain because that's what we're driving and delivering outperformance through. Simon Clinch : Great, thanks. And just as a follow-up. I mean if we want to talk about or think about a tougher mortgage market for longer sort of current levels, does that in any way change the I guess the pricing power, the competitive dynamics for EWS and mortgage going through a period like that, a prolonged period like that. Just wondering if you could help us think about the puts and takes in that regard? Mark Begor : We don't think so. The power of instant data, and in this case, we're talking about income and employment data is super valuable to every mortgage originator. They want to make sure that they have accurate data. We get it directly from the company every two weeks on the consumer. We deliver it instantly. In this environment of more shopping, a mortgage originator that's investing in a consumer, they want to make sure that they close that loan as they get down the path of delivering it. So we don't see a change in our ability to deliver new solutions, meaning products to the industry. Obviously, with more records, we're going to drive higher hit rates that happens really because we're getting the inquiries from our customers for all their applicants. And then we still believe that we have pricing power going forward because of the uniqueness of our data set, the alternative for our customers is to do it -- the mortgage customers to do the verification manually, which is very challenging, meaning getting a company on the phone to verify the income is very hard to do and it takes time, and that's labor and also time. So speed and productivity and accuracy is the value we deliver. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Your line is now live. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Hey Mark, just my first question, I just wanted to talk a little bit more like how we should be thinking about the future with some of the items that you were talking about, the increase in subprime delinquencies. We talked about auto for a while, we're talking about credit cards, cash being used up, like how does that impact the business over the next 12 months, I mean I know the employment has been fairly good at the lower end of the spectrum, but like there's a lot of parts of the spectrum where there's open jobs. They're not really filling those open jobs. And so I guess the first question is, how are you thinking about this on a go-forward basis? And then I have a follow-up. Mark Begor : Yes. Go forward, you got to kind of talk time frames. When you think out the next couple of quarters, it doesn't feel to us or to me like there's going to be a lot of change, meaning it's a fairly -- outside of the mortgage market, obviously, let's leave that aside. That's obviously super challenging and really unprecedented what's happening with interest rates. But when you have people working and very low unemployment rates, generally, they're able to pay their bills. When they pay their bills, delinquencies stay generally low, and then you have the ability -- our customers have confidence in continuing to extend credit through loans and other solutions to those consumers. Subprime has been challenged for a year. That's generally subprime is with the fintechs. Most of the big banks don't do subprime business. And that's been challenged for a year. And we're actually, as I mentioned earlier, starting to comp against fairly low levels. I would expect subprime to stay high as we go through 2024 because those consumers are really more challenged, not around being unemployed, but around inflation is still pressuring them. But the big metric that I always think about and you should, too, in my view, is unemployment. So back to your question about 2024, give me your forecast for unemployment next year. Is it going to go up, down or sideways, if you think unemployment is going to spike or go up, which I don't think it will in this environment with 10 million open jobs and only 5 million people looking right now, that's a pretty good environment to go into 2024 in kind of the core elements of our business outside of mortgage. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay, thank you. And then just going back to those government redeterminations, can you talk about like how does that work exactly, like once they get done, let\u2019s say they get done by June of next year. Is this something that the government is going to be doing annually or is this kind of a big onetime bang and then we're going to end up with tough comps on that after we're done with it? Mark Begor : Yes. Remember that the redeterminations were suspended during COVID. So they didn't happen over the last couple of years. Once President Biden lifted the COVID pandemic rule or requirement, these redeterminations went back into place. So it's really the completion of the annual verifications are happening in this 12-month time frame in third, fourth and first and second quarter next year. Post second quarter, they'll have the requirement to do the annual redeterminations that are a requirement of the programs. So there may be some elements of comp that from a timing standpoint, but we don't expect it to be meaningful. John W. Gamble, Jr.: And these redeterminations apply across multiple government subsidized programs, it's not just Medicaid, Medicare. And so it's more broad and we participate in many of those. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Jeff Meuler from Baird. Your line is now live. Jeffrey Meuler : Yeah, thank you. Sorry to keep pulling you back to this, but just given that it's a new metric you're going to be providing on an ongoing basis. So on the footnote and you said this as well, you're looking at internal data and then you're doing a Calcon [ph] records product, price and mix. It's not clear to me, like I know you said you don't think there's any change in share dynamics relative to a quarter ago. But if there are share shifts, is that accounted for in your market estimate, is it accounted for an outperformance, it's just -- it's not clear to me if you're looking at internal data based upon what volumes you're seeing how you would account first year...? Mark Begor : First off, we don't see any share shifts, Jeff. If there were, they would be in the outperformance. And remember, we still have a grounding in originations. As I mentioned, you have to forecast originations. And there's MBA which a lot of you look at and we look at it, too, is really diverge from what we're seeing in originations. And remember, we see originations on two sides of our business. We see it in in the credit business in USIS, and we see it in EWS and then we get actual originations on a five to six-month lag when they actually get posted to the credit file after the mortgage is closed. So we have really meaningful data. I think we were trying to highlight that the divergence we're seeing from some of those industry forecasts have just become larger in recent times, my view is my personal view because of the rapid change in rates. I think rates went up overnight or the last 48 hours by 50 bps. That's not in a forecast that MBA did a month ago, but we can see what's happening this afternoon. John W. Gamble, Jr.: And so what we'll be disclosing -- so what we'll disclose every quarter, again, is the outperformance with records, product, price and mix. And then over time, obviously, you're asking -- and we're comparing that against our volume, obviously. So over time, to the extent anything was to occur, which we're not seeing, okay, but then we would obviously talk to you about whether we're seeing differences between our own volume, and what we think is happening broadly in the market. But the metric we'll disclose every quarter really is driven by records, product, price and mix, which compares effectively our revenue to our volume. Because that's what we can actually measure. So when we talk about -- and it's what we've been doing in USIS for a very long time, right, as long as I can remember. Mark Begor : 15 to 20 years. John W. Gamble, Jr.: More than 10 years. So what we're talking about doing for EWS now is the same thing we've been doing for USIS for a very long period of time comparing revenue and the drivers against our volume metrics. Jeffrey Meuler : Understood. It's just been uses share shift now the dynamics I wanted to make sure I understood it. And then just can you just give us what the assumption is in the guidance for Q4 mortgage origination unit volumes? And can you comment on the number of TWN pulls per closed mortgage. It took a step up, I think, to like 2.5% in the pandemic. Has that been stable since, is it still going up, has it come down at all? John W. Gamble, Jr.: Yes. So in terms of again, we're not forecasting mortgage originations. What we're using is our internal volume data. So we gave you in the guidance what we're assuming for credit inquiries in the fourth quarter. And that's the basis we'd ask you to consider if we are going to see, I think, credit increase down 22%, which is about 18 percentage points worse than what we expected back in July. And so we think that's an indication of the direction of the market. And it's the basis on which we're calculating our volumes for USIS. We have a similar metric we use internally with EWS on their own volumes. And that's the basis on which we generated our forecast. We didn't try to come up with a mortgage originations forecast because we're going to focus on using the internal volume that we can actually measure. As Mark said, we can't measure originations at the end of the fourth quarter, in the fourth quarter. It's something that we want to have visibility to for quite some time following. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Andrew Nicholas from William Blair. Your line is now live. Andrew Nicholas : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First, wanted to touch on Boa Vista. I know you had given originally like $165 million revenue run rate. I think it was $160 million when you cited it in the second quarter, and you're holding that here today post close. Just kind of curious if you could bridge the performance there over the past nine months with how that end market is doing, how the business is doing, just kind of an update as it's now under your official ownership? Mark Begor : Yes. We're only, I don't know, 60 days in of having it under the ownership, but pleased to have it in. The market from our perspective is growing kind of high single digit. That's why we like the market down there in Brazil. We're very active in driving the integration of getting our new products and solutions there. We're going to move them to the Equifax Cloud over the next number of quarters to get them on our new cloud environment. We're going to bring down our large platforms like Interconnect, which they don't really have a version of that as well as Ignite, our analytics platform, which will really drive some strong competitiveness with Serasa Experian in the marketplace. The business performance, I would say, is probably lagging a bit that market performance, primarily through the integration. This is -- it was a complex integration for a small publicly traded company to go through the process. It was a long process to go through. Gosh, it was almost seven to eight months of the process to do the take private, but we're energized around the future of the business and focused on getting this integration complete and getting into new solutions and to help them drive their top line. Andrew Nicholas : Great, thank you. And then if I could ask just a clarifying question for my follow-up. In terms of the mortgage market outperformance in EWS, I think, first, I want to clarify that the 15% decline for 2024 that you talked about if conditions persist. I want to make sure that I understood that that's an inquiry estimate, or is that an origination estimate? And then also, when we think about the gap between those two numbers, is there any reason to believe that, that gap would -- and this is just kind of a question around the market itself, not your guys' performance. Any reason of that gap to narrow or widen in a prolonged weak environment, just kind of thinking about the different levels, levers if you can? Mark Begor : I'll jump in, and John can dive in behind me. First, on the last half of your question, we would expect the inquiries to be stronger than originations in this high mortgage rate environment. You call it weaker, but if you're a consumer and in many cases, stretching to get a mortgage for a home that you want to buy because prices are still very high you do a lot of shopping around when there's a high interest rate environment. I don't think that's going to change next year. I think we're still going to see that environment, which certainly will benefit USIS with more credit pulls in that shopping environment. You want to add, John, on the forecast. John W. Gamble, Jr.: Sure. So the first question, yes, the down 15% was a statement specifically about to the extent the run rate we're talking about in the fourth quarter of 2023 for mortgage credit inquiries continues, then we would expect 2024 to be down 15%, if that's the level that the market stays at, right. So... Mark Begor : From origination? John W. Gamble, Jr.: For mortgage credit inquiries, down 15%. Mark Begor : And then against that, and we'll give guidance in February. But against that down 15%, we would have our levers in both businesses around price, product penetration to deliver the outperformance against that market. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners. Your line is now live. Craig Huber : Hi, good morning. First question, can you quantify for us the revenue performance in the U.S. for credit cards and autos and what the outlook is there for the fourth quarter? Mark Begor : Yes. I don't think we give the actual revenue numbers, John. John W. Gamble, Jr.: We do not. What we indicated is we thought that FI performed well in the quarter that auto performed well in the quarter. We had very good performance in commercial and we had really nice performance in counts identity and fraud business. So auto and FI were two of the strong performers that showed very good growth in the quarter for us, but we don't actually disclose the specific revenue levels. Mark Begor : And I would say we don't expect real change in the fourth quarter from that third quarter run rate. John W. Gamble, Jr.: No, we're expecting business. We're expecting fourth quarter to continue to be good in those businesses really. Craig Huber : So is your argument then with the much higher interest rates out there, obviously impacting mortgages, as you've talked quite a bit about here. You're not seeing significant impact to the rest of your business with a much higher rate. Obviously, the 10-year rate is approaching 5% here, has been at that level for many, many years are you not seeing an impact from much higher rates anywhere else in your business? Mark Begor : We haven't. But again, let me just be a little more deliberate for example, like in subprime auto, there's been some pressure there from originations because they're more deliberate around that subprime consumer being challenged. And then that subprime consumer at that higher interest rate even in parts is sometimes challenged to qualify for that. But broadly, no, when you think sometimes a small portion of the financial services industry, most of it is near in prime. And higher interest rates have not impacted auto originations or card originations in the near prime and prime space like they have in mortgage. Mortgage is just a big ticket item that had a massive impact on the rates over such a short time frame. Craig Huber : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live. Faiza Alwy : Yeah, hi, thank you. So I wanted to ask about mortgage again and really inquiries. So I know that the MBA forecast changes quite a bit. But I'm curious how you think about the MBA index and the application data that comes out every Wednesday morning because that showed that 3Q applications were down 29%, which is in line with your inquiry decline. So I would have thought that inquiries because you're talking about higher shopping, I would have thought inquiries would have done better than that. So just give us some perspective into how we should think about that data and really what's going on with inquiries relative to applications? John W. Gamble, Jr.: Yes. So I think to our earlier commentary, I think what we're finding is there's lots of pieces of market estimates that are being disclosed by various third parties that I think in this current environment, our difficult -- estimates are difficult to make. And admittedly, they're difficult to correlate. So that's why -- honestly, we've shifted to trying to use our own internal actual volume data so that we can try to track it over time. We'll certainly have a perspective as we look back historically, and we look at our volume data on inquiries relative to actual applications and actual originations they occur, and we'll be happy to talk about that. But trying to do it real time right now, I think it's just is very difficult given the movements in the environment. And that's why we think it's better for us and better for you, quite honestly, if what we talk to you about is our actual volume data and then the things that are driving our performance to be better than our actual volume data. Faiza Alwy : Okay. Understood. And then maybe just give us some perspective, again, on this inquiry question sort of where we were maybe pre-pandemic and what happened during the pandemic in terms of number of inquiries per whether it's application or for origination sort of how far ahead are we, was it three or four inquiries back in 2019, did that fall down, are we at seven or eight now. Just some perspective on how much higher inquiries are now would be helpful? Mark Begor : And versus what time frame, they've grown over the last three, four, five years really because of consumer behavior as well as more -- the majority of mortgage applications happen online today, which is a phenomenon that is very different from what it was five years ago, which drives more credit polls. Over the last year, they're fairly consistent, meaning it hasn't changed in the last year, but they're clearly up from five, four years ago, even three years ago. John W. Gamble, Jr.: And again, and I know you know this right, but we disclosed -- we provide every quarter what the actual inquiry numbers look like, how the -- sorry, what the actual movements in inquiries were so you can see how that's trending over time. Faiza Alwy : Okay, understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Toni Kaplan : Thanks for taking my question. Historically, pricing wasn't really a big contributor to growth for the bureaus overall, but it seems like it's more of a driver in recent years for you and especially now. Obviously, work number has been an area you've been able to increase price. I think you've also talked about introducing new products at higher price points in other parts of the business, too. So I guess when we think about like a 7% to 10% normalized organic growth rate for Equifax, how much of that should come from price increases and maybe help us out with regard to like the segments as well? Mark Begor : Sure. First, I'm not sure when you talk about history, I've only been here five years, but over the past five years, price has always been a lever for Equifax and, I believe, for our competitors. I think it's one of the things that data analytics companies have is if you have more valuable data, you're able to charge more for it. Price, as you point out, we really execute two ways, pure price, meaning we do annual price increases. And we also get price through delivering new products with either more historical data or data combinations that deliver more value to our customers. And remember, our sale is an ROI sale. So with regards to the 7% to 10% organic, which is the subset of our 8% to 12%, if you go back to our Investor Day from a couple of years ago, there's charts on each business where we talk about the levers to deliver that 7% to 10%. And as a reminder, the 7% to 10% is really driven by EWS being north of that and International and USIS being south of that. And if you think about we have levers that are fairly balanced to deliver that 7% to 10%. You've got a few points over the long term of market in GDP. You've got a few points of price. You've got a few points each of these are kind of a couple -- 2 points to 3 points, a couple of points of product driving that top line. And then you've got penetration in new verticals that we move into. And that's kind of how you walk up. And then in EWS uniquely, we get a couple of points from records. So I think 2, 3, 4 points from record additions over the long term that drive our revenue. And as you know, on the records is because we're already getting inquiries and when we add a new record to the data set we monetize. So that drives the revenue growth. So I wouldn't characterize price as being disproportionate in -- versus the other levers that we have, and it's been fairly consistent over the time I've been here about how we've executed it. John W. Gamble, Jr.: And then we'll publish a supplemental deck here in the next couple of hours. And then in that deck for each of the business units, we'll provide a walk kind of for the long-term model that gives you price and depending on the business unit records, etcetera, that can provide perspectives on how we expect to be able to drive benefits for the drivers between -- the drivers of our revenue growth on a long-term basis. So hopefully, that will help as well. Toni Kaplan : Yes, terrific. And then if I caught your comments earlier correctly, you mentioned that 50% of your revenue is coming -- within EWS is coming from products containing historical records. Has that mix meaningfully changed versus like a year ago, just wanting to understand? Mark Begor : It's probably up slightly from a year ago, but it's up meaningfully from three, four, five years ago. And it's really -- as you may recall, Toni, and we talked about it, as we've moved EWS to the cloud, call it 18 months ago almost, it really opened up the window for them number one, to deliver new products; and number two, a lot of those new products are using trended or historical data, which was more challenging to do pre-cloud. So -- and you've seen EWS' Vitality Index, which kind of pre-cloud was in the 3% to 5% range, something like that, probably at the low end. And now as we talked about earlier this morning is north of 20. And all those products, either our data combinations or predominantly our trended historical data. And if you think about it, just quite -- it's common sense, Mark's income today is very valuable as a data element, but Mark's income over the last 36 months is even more valuable if it's going up. It's a very important indicator if it was going down. And then if it's stable, it's an important indicator. So that's the value that we're able to deliver in that massive historical data set we have. And we would expect that 50% to move up, but it's probably up 20 points in the last three or four years. John W. Gamble, Jr.: It's up certainly significantly, right. And I think if you just look at it by line of business, mortgage has grown substantially, as Mark's talked about, because of mortgage 36 and the use of trended data across mortgage very broadly now, and that's moved up towards 50% of transactions. The government is less, right, in terms of trended information. It tends to be more point in time. Talent is virtually all trended information. And then so as the mix of our business moves, that ratio can mix a bit, it can change a bit. But generally speaking, in all of our verticals, we're driving the mix to trended data from the levels they're at today. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ashish Sabadra from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to drill down further on Toni's question on pricing. And particularly, FICO price increases was a significant tailwind for mortgage revenues within USIS or OIS this year. How should we think about those tailwinds going into next year and offsetting some of the mortgage inquiry headwinds for next year? Thanks. John W. Gamble, Jr.: Yes. I don't know if you follow FICO or you talked to the FICO team, but I would expect that they're going to do a price increase in 2024. You should talk to them. And if they do, we're obviously the conduit along with you and Experian to deliver that to the marketplace, and that's something that we would execute on. Ashish Sabadra : That's very helpful color. And maybe just on the Boa Vista earnings accretion. So that was pretty positive $0.02 accretion in the quarter. Is that the run rate that we should think about going into 2024 or can you talk about the puts and takes from an earnings accretion perspective in 2024? Thanks. John W. Gamble, Jr.: Yes. So we'll give you that detail when we give guidance, obviously, for 2024. But in the fourth quarter, it's similar to what it was in the third. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Seth Weber from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Seth Weber : Hi, good morning. I just wanted to follow up on Boa Vista for a second. The footnote on Slide 4 seems to suggest the margins were higher excluding Boa Vista, but I thought at the time of the acquisition, EBITDA margins for that asset were running like in the high 30% range. So were there some kind of like onetime costs there that impacted the results or is there something -- I'm just trying -- I'm just looking at the footnote on Slide 4? Thanks. John W. Gamble, Jr.: Fair enough. The EBITDA margin was -- for Boa Vista was slightly below, it was below the Equifax average margin. And what we're expecting over time, as Mark talked about, through the investments we're making through integrating them into Equifax processes that will work to drive that margin higher. But yes, for what you saw in the footnote, the BVS margins were below the Equifax margins for the third quarter. Now as a reminder, we've owned them for about six weeks, so we'll see what happens as we move through the fourth quarter and then into 2024. Seth Weber : No, that's fair. I just -- I thought that the acquisition, the margins were high 30s. That was the frame and spirit of the question. But -- and then just another follow-up. Sorry if I missed this, but are there any more details on this, the new $1.2 billion contract, when that starts, how that rolls in, is that ratable over the term of the contract or just how we should start thinking about filtering that into our forecasts? Thanks. Mark Begor : Yes. Remember, that's an extension of an existing contract. So we've had a contract for five-plus years and maybe longer with CMS. It's certainly larger and it will roll in both at the federal and then at the state level as we go through fourth quarter in 2024 and 2025 and beyond. John W. Gamble, Jr.: I think it's an outstanding, as Mark said, largest contract we've ever signed. Just as you take a look at over the next five years it doesn't mean you're going to -- we'll generate all the revenue up to the maximum amount of the contract. So what it does is gives us the opportunity to work with states and obviously with the federal government to drive increasing revenue under the auspices of the agreement, which is extremely positive, but it is certainly in no way a guarantee of revenue at that level. Seth Weber : Got it, okay. Thank you guys, I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. George Tong : Hi, thanks. Good morning. You've previously seen evidence of mortgage insourcing of their verification needs within EWS. Can you provide an update on some of those trends and in-sourcing activity outside of the mortgage vertical? Mark Begor : So George, I'm not sure what you mean by in-sourcing or I think you used the terms we provided evidence. Are you referring to our comments in July about the manual work we were doing for customers that was where we did not have records? George Tong : No, it's where mortgage originators because volumes are down so much and because they apparently had so much time on their hands they were just doing it themselves rather than... Mark Begor : And that was the discussion we had back in July, and it was around where we were doing the manual efforts for our customers and a very small operation in Iowa, where we did not have the records. And we talked about the fact that I was moving in house. We haven't seen any evidence of mortgage originators shifting from using our instant solution to doing it themselves. So that has not been a dialogue from Equifax. George Tong : Got it. And assuming that the same holds true outside of the mortgage vertical. Mark Begor : Yes, for sure. That's how we're growing our business because they're using more of our solutions. We deliver productivity and we deliver speed and accuracy. So that's fundamental. We see no trends in any of the verticals of where they're going back to manual what you're seeing in the business. That's how we're delivering the double-digit growth in the quarter and the double-digit growth we expect in the fourth quarter of -- one of those levers is more conversions of existing manual effort to using our instant solution. George Tong : Got it, thank you for that. And then sticking with EWS. Workforce Solutions, non-mortgage, nongovernment, can you discuss some of the trends that you're seeing there and the sensitivity of customers to pricing trends in the Verifications business? Mark Begor : Yes. Do you want to talk about talent or exclude talent from that, too? George Tong : Focus on verifications. Mark Begor : Well, okay. So you're talking about like in -- and you want to leave mortgage out and focus on card and P loans and auto or do you want to talk mortgage to, I'm just trying to figure out which part of verification you want to cover. George Tong : Yes, non-mortgage, non-government. Mark Begor : Non-mortgage, nongovernment talent. George Tong : Yes. Talent, I guess. Mark Begor : Yes. So we haven't seen sensitivity to our customers around pricing in any of those verticals. Because of the value that it delivers, you got to be obviously clear that we're balanced around pricing, but the customers are using our solution because of the productivity and accuracy and then the instant access to the information as well as the scale of the data set. We didn't talk much on the call about our ability to continue to add records. And we're approaching 70% of nonfarm payroll and over 50% of kind of working Americans, including 1099 and income-producing Americans, including pension, that data set is super valuable in all those verification markets. And -- as you know, we also have a big focus on adding new products, which is exhibited by the Vitality Index, which a lot of that vitality -- actually, most of that vitality is in verification, is really delivering new solutions that help our customers expedite or complete the transactions using our Instant data. John W. Gamble, Jr.: And talent, I know we've said this many times, no one likes price increases. But for example, in talent, one of the things we do in other segments as we provide incentives for people to be able to get better pricing from us by moving to top of waterfall, or by selling additional products to drive growth across the broader sweat -- I'm sorry, broader suite of our entire group of products that's talent solutions like our education solutions and other solutions, and we're launching now products that support health care directly. We have staffing products. We have other products that allow people to get better pricing from Equifax while helping us drive volumes through the system. So again, we -- just like we don't like price increases, we know no one likes price increases, but we try to be balanced, and we try to structure them so that people have the opportunity to purchase the products that they want at price points that are effective for them. George Tong : Got it, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Heather Balsky : Hi, thank you for taking my question. I wanted to touch on the cloud migration. So first part, it sounds like it's lagging a little bit from what you said last quarter. I'm curious if you can help us kind of understand what's going on with that transition and where, I guess, the headwinds have been? And then with regards to your plans with the transition, when do you think we could start seeing the benefits of that on the USIS side? Thanks. Mark Begor : Yes. Look, cloud transformations are hard. This has been super complex and the most complex cloud transformation that we're executing is in USIS given the age of the legacy infrastructure and formats that we had. And we're clearly a few months behind, but we can see the finish line in completing it. As we said earlier, we're migrating large customers, as we speak, in the fourth quarter. Those will continue in the first quarter, and we'd expect to be complete with USIS as well as many of our international platforms in the early parts or first half of 2024. And that's a big pivot point, as you point out. When are we going to start seeing the benefits? We're starting to see it. And what we saw in EWS is what we would expect to see in USIS. And we talked earlier about EWS' ability to drive new product rollouts at a very rapid pace, well above our 10% goal at the 20% plus. We would expect USIS to grow their vitality index, which today is south of 10 and move towards 10. And I think we mentioned they've grown their vitality about 100 basis points. We also mentioned, and we've talked about it on calls really for the last four years, but in the last couple of calls, that in USIS in particular, because of the ability to deliver always-on stability, the ability to have faster data transmission and then obviously leveraging our differentiated data, we do expect in USIS to get some share gains. And that really comes forward, where we move from a tertiary position to a second or primary position. And we had one large FI in the U.S., which is where USIS is, obviously, that's making that move with us because of the cloud. So we would expect more of those to come forward as we complete the cloud in 2024 and then really between share gains and new product rollouts that to help drive USIS' growth rates in 2024 and 2025 and beyond. Heather Balsky : And can I ask a follow-up. Just when you talk about share gains, how should we think about it, are you taking business from other creditors or is it expanding the wallet and benefiting that way? Mark Begor : No. When you talk about share gains, it's what you would think a share gain is, is where we're moving from secondary to primary or tertiary to secondary because of the cloud. And having the most advanced technology, we think, is an advantage. That's one of the reasons we embarked on this is at our gut, we believe, to be a great data analytics company, a great technology company. And when you overlay the digital macro of our customers doing the vast majority of their transactions with their consumers online, you have to delivered 99 [ph] to stability. You can't do that in the legacy environment. You can only do with cloud, and you have to have that for data transmission. So we think that's going to advantage Equifax going forward. And then you lay on top of it, you'd be able to roll out new solutions more quickly and more of them. That's going to be advantaged to Equifax to become a more important partner that will drive us up from those secondary positions that could be 20% or 30% of the volume to the primary positions, which could be 60%, 70%, 80%. And that's really what we have in front of us from the cloud investment, and we would expect those benefits to roll the USIS. And one last point that we mentioned is getting USIS cloud native will also allow us to do more between EWS and USIS. That was hard pre-cloud in two legacy environments with different data sets that are in different data environments. As you know, we went to a single data fabric and having them both in the cloud, that's going to be another gear for us going forward to have data combination solutions between USIS and EWS that was really hard to do before. And of course, only we can do that between credit data and the other differentiated data in USIS in combination with the income and employment data that's really only Equifax. Operator : Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over for any further or closing comments. Trevor Burns : Yes, it's Trevor Burns. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to me and Sam. Otherwise, have a great day. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

The question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I would now turn the conference over to Trevor Burns, Senior Vice President of Corporate Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Trevor Burns : Thanks, and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Trevor Burns. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the IR Calendar section of the News & Events tab on our IR website. During the call, we'll be making reference to certain materials that can also be found in the Presentation section of the News and Events tab at our IR website. These materials are labeled 4Q 2023 earnings conference call. Also, we\u2019ll making certain forward-looking statements, including first quarter and full-year 2024 guidance to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors that may impact our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2022 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. We'll also be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted on certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. In the fourth quarter, Equifax incurred a restructuring charge of $19 million or $0.11 a share. This charge was for costs incurred as we realigned business functions ahead of completing our technology transformation. This restructuring charge is excluded from adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and can be found in the Financial Results section of the Financial Info tab at our IR website. Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark. Mark Begor : Thanks, Trevor, and good morning. Before I cover results for the quarter, I wanted to spend a few minutes on our 2023 performance. Equifax performed extremely well last year against our EFX 2025 strategic priorities. Our strong performance was against one of the most challenging mortgage markets in the last 20-plus years with our USIS mortgage inquiries down 34% and Equifax mortgage revenue down 17%, which equates to almost $500 million of lost mortgage revenue last year. Despite the significant decline in 2023 mortgage revenue, Equifax delivered. We delivered 2% organic constant currency revenue growth with 7% organic constant currency non-mortgage revenue growth, which was at the low end of our long-term 7% to 10% growth rate. Importantly, we had sequential improvement during the year with 8% total growth and 9% non-mortgage growth in the fourth quarter. We also delivered over 100 new products with a vitality of 14%, which was a record for Equifax and well above our 10% long-term goal. EWF delivered strong 10% organic non-mortgage revenue growth, which allowed them to deliver flat total growth despite mortgage revenue that was down 23%. They delivered sequential non-mortgage revenue growth and exited fourth quarter with strong 17% non-mortgage growth. Verifier non-mortgage revenue grew 14%, led by government that grew over 30% and talent that grew 5% despite the white collar hiring market that was down just under 10%. EWS grew current twin records to $168 million, up $16 million or 11% and grew total records to $657 million or $53 million records. We added 17 new twin partnerships last year, our highest number ever and have a strong pipeline for 2024. And in the third quarter, EWS signed a contract extension to provide income verification to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as part of a contract valued at up to $1.2 billion over the next five years, which is the largest contract in Equifax's history. EWS also delivered over 20% new product vitality. USIS delivered 4% revenue growth with 7% non-mortgage growth within their 6% to 8% long-term growth framework, while mortgage declined 5%. The USIS Commercial and Consumer Solutions business had very strong years with double-digit revenue growth led by strong market penetration and new products. International delivered 12% constant dollar revenue growth and 6% organic constant dollar growth, led by continued very strong 17% organic growth in Latin America with a vitality index over 15% and close to 10% revenue growth in our UK CRA. And in July, we completed the BVS acquisition in the fast-growing Brazilian market. We delivered these strong results while making significant progress towards completing our cloud migration, ending the year with about 70% of Equifax revenue in the new Equifax Cloud. We decommissioned seven data centers and migrated about 37,000 customers to the Equifax Cloud. We are convinced that our new EFX cloud single data fabric and AI capabilities are delivering new differentiated products faster with better performance and will provide a competitive advantage to Equifax for years to come. The strong progress we made in 2023 will enable the substantial completion of our North American transformation and customer migrations in the first half of 2024, including decommissioning of the mainframes and major North American data centers. Also in 2024, we expect to make substantial progress towards completing transformation activities in Europe and Latin America. By the end of 2024, we expect to have about 90% of our revenue in the new Equifax cloud with the vast majority of new models and scores being built using Equifax AI. In 2023, we executed very well against our EFX Cloud and broader operational restructuring plan across Equifax, reflecting cost reductions from the closure of major North American data centers and other broader spending controls in excess of our original $210 million goal. We expect an incremental $90 million of run rate spending reductions in 2024, which is up about $25 million from our prior forecast due to the additional actions we took in the fourth quarter that will benefit 2024. Of this $90 million 2024 spending reduction, about $60 million reduces operating expenses and $30 million reduces capital spending. These actions are improving operating margins and lowering the capital intensity of our business. As we move into 2024, I'm energized by our commercial momentum, NPI capabilities and the benefits of the new Equifax Cloud. Turning to Slide 4, our strong fourth quarter gives us momentum as we move into the new year. Fourth quarter revenue of $1.327 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.81 per share were both at the high end of our guidance. And EBITDA margins at 33.7% were up about 60 bps sequentially. Our non-mortgage businesses, which represent about 85% of total revenue in the quarter, were very strong with 14% constant currency and 9% organic constant currency non-mortgage revenue growth, also at the high end of our 7% to 10% long-term organic growth framework driven by strong performances at EWS and international. Total U.S. mortgage market was slightly stronger than we expected in the quarter with USIS inquiries down 17%. As mortgage rates declined during the quarter from a 23-year high of 7.9% in late October to about 6.8% late in the year, we saw some increased activity to expect we'll grow if rates continue to decline in 2024. Mortgage volumes began to strengthen slightly relative to normal seasonal levels in December, and we've continued the slight improvements during January, which is a good sign if the market has bottomed. Mortgage market outperformance of 33% for USIS and 18% for EWS last year in the quarter were strong and about as expected. We'll share further perspectives on the mortgage market when we discuss our 2024 guidance. At the BU level, EWS non-mortgage revenue was up a strong 17% and above our expectations, principally due to strength in our government and talent businesses, which drove adjusted EWS EBITDA margins sequentially to above 51%. USIS had a good quarter with revenue up 5%, slightly above our expectations, principally due to stronger mortgage revenue, which drove adjusted EBITDA margins up about 100 basis points sequentially to 35%. International delivered 22% constant dollar revenue growth and 6% organic constant currency revenue growth, excluding the impact of the BVS acquisition. Very strong growth in Latin America and Europe were principally offset by lower-than-expected growth in Asia Pacific. International delivered very strong 31.2% adjusted EBITDA margins, up about 500 basis points sequentially and much stronger than our expectations. Before I cover our business unit results in more detail, I wanted to provide an overview of what we're seeing in the U.S. economy and with the consumer. Broadly, outside of what appears to be a bottoming of the mortgage market, there's not a lot of change from our prior view. The U.S. consumer and our customers remain broadly resilient. Employment remains at historic levels with low unemployment and almost 9 million open jobs, which is a positive for consumers and our customers. However, there continue to be some constraints in white collar hiring. Credit card delinquency rates for prime consumers, which represent about 80% of the market are stable and at historically low levels at less than 1%, but above pre-pandemic levels. However, subprime borrower delinquencies, which have been increasing over the past year are now above pre-pandemic levels and are approaching 2009 levels. Auto delinquency rates for prime consumers, which represent about 80% of the market are also stable and well below 1%, but are above pre-pandemic levels. Delinquencies for subprime consumers are above pre-pandemic levels, as well as above the levels we saw in 2009. And any credit tiding that we've seen has been largely in fintech and subprime, which started well over a year ago. When consumers are working, they largely have the capacity to keep current on their financial obligations, which is good for our customers and for Equifax. Turning to Slide 5, strong twin record growth and the positive impact from new products, penetration and price drove a strong 18 points of EWS mortgage outperformance in the quarter. As expected, mortgage outperformance was down sequentially from the third quarter as we lapped the 2022 launch of our Mortgage 36 trended data product. EWS had another very strong quarter of twin record additions, adding five million current records in the quarter and $16 million during 2023. EWS grew twin records 11% in the quarter to $168 million on 124 million unique individuals, which was up 9%. Total records, both current and historic are now over $655 million and were up 9%. In terms of coverage, we have current employment records on about 75% of U.S. non-farm payroll and about 60% coverage on the $220 million income-producing Americans. At 124 million active records, we have plenty of room to grow the twin database. During the quarter, we signed agreements with six new payroll processors that will deliver records in 2024. In 2023, we added partnerships with 17 payroll processors and over the past three years, have added partnerships with 33 payroll processors. During the quarter, EWS also surpassed a significant milestone with over three million companies contributing to the work number every pay period, a huge milestone as we continue to focus on expanding our twin coverage. The market continues to adopt higher-value solutions that include trended employment and income history that only Equifax can deliver. For example, in the fourth quarter, over 50% of mortgage revenue incorporated historic records. Turning to Slide 6, Workforce Solutions revenue was up a strong 10% in the quarter, which is a very positive sign as we look towards 2024. Non-mortgage revenue growth of 17% was very strong and up 600 basis points sequentially and at the highest levels that we saw in 2023. Importantly, Verification Services non-mortgage revenue, which represents about 75% of Verifier revenue delivered very strong 27% in the growth in the quarter and was up 16 points sequentially. In Government, we saw continued very strong growth with revenue up 47% in the quarter and over 30% for the year. Government revenue was slightly stronger than our expectations given continued CMS redeterminations, the new SNAP contract, record growth, state penetration and pricing. We expect continued growth in government throughout 2024 with stronger growth in the first half as CMS redeterminations complete prior to the second quarter. Talent Solutions revenue was up 13% in the quarter and up 700 basis points sequentially. As we discussed, we are currently more heavily penetrated to white collar workers, including technology, professional services and financial services, which has seen a greater reduction in hiring activity and broad hiring freezes and layoffs than the total labor market over the past 12 to 18 months. These markets are off to a slow start again in January, and we would expect to see slower revenue growth in the first quarter in talent than we delivered in the fourth quarter. We outperformed these underlying markets in the fourth quarter by over 25 points as we delivered new digital solutions, strong new product growth, pricing and continued expansion of Twin records. Employer Services revenue was down 7% and in line with our expectations, driven by declines in ERC revenue, which is now about $5 million per quarter as the U.S. government has suspended processing new ERC claims. ERC revenue is expected to stay at about these levels through 2024, and we'll see headwinds in our employer vertical from this ERC decline through the third quarter of 2024. Excluding the impact of the declining ERC revenue, Employer Services revenue grew during the quarter driven by growth in our I9 and onboarding businesses despite the negative impact of U.S. hiring. Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margins of 51.2% were better than our expectations, principally due to better expected revenue performance. The strength of EWS and uniqueness and value of their twin income and employment data, and employer services businesses would clear again in 2023. EWS is expected to deliver strong growth in 2024 and continue above market growth in the future. On Slide 7, I'd like to expand on the significant opportunities still in front of us for EWS. This slide details a big $15 billion EWS TAM versus their $2.3 billion of revenue last year. EWS has plenty of room to grow. As you can see, with the exception of housing, which includes mortgage, where our penetration is on the order of 60%, our penetration is in the range of 10% to 20% in each target market where we compete. In each of these markets, we principally compete against pay-per-pay stubs or other forms of manual verifications and we deliver instant verifications, productivity, speed and accuracy. In both mortgage, government and talent, where there's a requirement for broad coverage and depth of detail and in talent and mortgage, where there's a need for historical data, we have an opportunity to drive strong future growth from penetration in our existing verticals and leverage that penetration as we continue to expand twin record coverage towards the $220 million income-producing Americans in the United States. As shown on Slide 8, USIS revenue was up over 5% and above our expectations, principally due to stronger-than-expected mortgage revenue. USIS delivered non-mortgage revenue growth of about just over 3% in the quarter and slightly below our 4% growth expectation. USIS mortgage revenue was up 16% and outperformed the mortgage credit inquiries that were down 17% by 33 points. The strong pricing environment drove the very strong outperformance. At $78 million in the quarter, mortgage revenue was 18% of total USIS revenue. B2B non-mortgage online revenue growth was down slightly less than 1% and below our expectations. We continue to see double-digit growth in commercial and single-digit growth in telco and auto with banking and lending about flat. The declines were principally due to weakness in D2C, our business where we sell data to other credit bureaus and insurance. Financial Marketing Services, our B2B offline business was up 7% and much better than our expectations. In marketing, we saw mid-single-digit growth in the quarter led by double-digit growth in our IXI consumer wealth data business, partially offset by declines in pre-screen marketing. While pre-screen marketing revenue was down in the quarter, we did see an improvement over prior quarters with a return to growth in fintech pre-screen marketing. We continue to see declines in smaller FIs, partially offset by growth in larger FIs. Within risk and account services, we saw limited growth in our portfolio review business but not to the levels we would typically see if our customers were expecting a weakening economy. And within fraud, we saw double-digit revenue growth primarily from new business. USIS Consumer Solutions D2C business had another very strong quarter, up 15% from very good performances in both our consumer direct and indirect channels. And USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 35.1% in the quarter and in line with our October guidance. Todd and the U.S. team are on offense as they complete their cloud transformation in the first half of 2024 and pivot to leveraging their new cloud capabilities to deliver new products and drive share gains. In the quarter, the USIS team signed an extension to the NCTUE cellphone and utility payment data relationship, allowing USIS to exclusively manage the database and continue bringing new products to market that expand lending to consumers, including our differentiated USIS mortgage credit file solution that incorporates NC+ cell phone and utility data that only Equifax can provide. Turning to Slide 9, International revenue was up 22% in constant currency and up 6% in organic constant currency, excluding the impact of BBS and above the 20% growth we guided to in October due to better-than-expected revenue in Latin America, slightly offset by lower Asia Pacific revenue. Europe, local currency revenue was up a strong 9% in the quarter from strong double-digit growth in our UK CRE business. And as expected, a return to growth from our UK debt management business. Latin America local currency revenue, excluding Brazil, was up 30% versus last year, driven by strong double-digit growth in Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Central America from new product introductions and pricing actions. Brazil revenue in the quarter on a reported basis was $41 million. We continue to make good progress on the Brazil integration with strong progress in bringing new Equifax solutions such as count and mitigator to the Brazilian market as well as bringing EFX data and analytics expertise to our Brazilian customers. Our global Equifax teams are very engaged in integration activities, including moving BVS to the Equifax cloud and single data fabric. Canada delivered low single-digit growth in the quarter as expected. Canada will complete their migration to the Equifax cloud by mid-2024. And similar to USIS, we expect to see accelerated NPI growth going forward. In Asia Pacific, revenue was below our expectations with revenue down 2% and to -- due to lower market volumes in Consumer and Commercial, particularly late in November and December. We expect Asia Pacific to have declining revenue in the first half of 2024 due to the softer market conditions and the near-term impact of long-term contract extensions we signed with several large customers. We expect Asia Pacific to return to revenue growth in the second half of 2024. Despite the decline in revenue, Asia Pacific adjusted EBITDA margins were up over 200 basis points sequentially from strong cost management. International adjusted EBITDA margins of 31.2%, were up almost 500 basis points sequentially, an outstanding performance. The improvement was driven by revenue growth and good execution against our 2023 cost reduction plan by Lisa and the international team. Turning to Slide 10. In the fourth quarter, overall non-mortgage constant dollar revenue grew a very strong 14% with organic growth of 9%, up over 250 basis points sequentially. A very good sign as we move into 2024. The acceleration in organic revenue growth was driven by very strong EWS Verifier non-mortgage revenue performance. As we look to 2024, we expect non-mortgage constant dollar revenue growth to be over 10.5% with organic growth of almost 8.5%, about 150 basis points above the levels delivered last year. Non-mortgage organic revenue growth is expected to be led again by EWS, driven by strong growth in their government and talent businesses. Turning to Slide 11. We delivered strong 14% vitality, again in the quarter, led by very strong performance in EWS with a VI over 20% as well as over 15% in Latin America. Importantly, USIS accelerated in the fourth quarter to 7%, which was up over 200 basis points sequentially as we get closer to cloud completion and are able to begin to leverage our new cloud native infrastructure for innovation and new products. Our strong vitality index results are not only led by over 100 new products launched in each of the last four years, but the increasing average revenue per new product, which is up close to 50% since 2021. During the quarter, about 90% of new product revenue came from non-mortgage products leveraging the Equifax cloud. The positive momentum in our NPI and Vitality Index is encouraging for the future and reinforces our long-term strategy of leveraging our differentiated data assets and new cloud capabilities to drive new solutions for our customers. Leveraging our Equifax cloud capabilities to drive new product rollouts, we expect to deliver a vitality index of over 10% again in 2024. On the right side of the slide, we've highlighted several new products introduced in the quarter. These new solutions are a testament to the power of the Equifax cloud and driving innovation that can create the visibility of consumers to help expand access to credit and create new mainstream financial opportunities as well as drive Equifax top line growth and margins. Turning to Slide 12, we believe Equifax AI, leveraging our differentiated data assets, our new Equifax cloud capabilities and new product focus, is positioning our industry-leading EFX AI powered model scores and products. On the left of the side of the slide, our large and diverse proprietary data sets is a significant differentiator for Equifax. Our proprietary data at scale, keyed in linked in our single data fabric leveraging our new AFX cloud gives us significant advantages in using AI to build more predictive multi-data models, scores and products. Our ESXi is enabled by our EFX developed explainable AI solutions that leverage our Ignite platform and our Google Vertex capabilities. Our modern AI and ML-enabled cloud-based model scoring engine and our over 1,000 Equifax DNA professionals. AI leveraging our patented explainable AI capabilities is a big priority for Equifax in '24 and beyond as we complete the Equifax cloud. As shown on the chart in the middle of Slide 12, we've made tremendous progress building advanced models in leveraging our market-leading AI capabilities. In 2023, 70% of our new models were built using AI and ML tools, up from 60% in '22 with a goal of over 80% this year. Our investments in AI are generating results. To date, Equifax has received over 90 approved AI patents supporting areas such as our proprietary AI NeuroDecision Technology, or NDT, an explainable AI with over 130 AI patents pending. We've launched new products developing at EFX AI, including Equifax OneScore for consumers incorporating traditional credit, alternative credit, as well as cell phone utility and pay TV data, which has improved the performance of the solution to score 20% more consumers. We are energized about the capabilities that Equifax AI is bringing to strengthen our business and accelerate the value of our proprietary data through richer data combinations. Now let's turn to 2024 guidance. Moving to Slide 13, we entered 2024 with momentum from the fourth quarter and the underlying growth of our non-mortgage businesses and the strong execution against our EFX 2026 strategic priorities. The U.S. mortgage market appears to have bottomed and through January, we're seeing some slight improvements versus our expectations in both USIS and EWS, which is good news for the future. Our 2024 planning assumption is that the current level of U.S. mortgage activity will continue for the rest of the year with adjustments for seasonality. On this basis, U.S. mortgage inquiries across USIS and EWS would be down on a blended basis by 15%. We're assuming twin inquiries will see a slightly smaller decline in USIS credit inquiries as the level of consumer shopping behavior moderates. For perspective, our 2024 framework is over 30 points lower than the average current forecast from MBA, which is currently forecasting 24 origination units, up 17% versus our down 15%. And Fannie Mae, which is not forecast units, but is forecasting origination dollar volumes up 24%. MBA and Fannie Mae forecast mortgage rates move down to 6.1% and 5.8%, respectively, from 6.8% today. We will continue to forecast our mortgage market trends or current EFX run rates as we have done for the past 5-plus years. And as in the past, we do not include interest rate decreases or increases in our forecast. We will continue to share mortgage credit inquiry volume changes with you each quarter so you can make your own judgments on the mortgage market outlook for the future. Further, we are assuming that the U.S. economy will see modest deacceleration in '24 with growth slightly below the 2% average we generally assume in our long-term growth framework. In our key international countries, we expect slowing and low levels of GDP growth in Australia and in Canada, UK and Brazil, we expect about flat GDP. Despite the decline in the U.S. mortgage market and some modest economic deacceleration across our major markets, we expect to deliver 2024 revenue of about $5.72 billion at the midpoint of our guidance with reported growth at the midpoint of 8.6%. Constant currency revenue growth is expected to be about 10.5%, with organic constant currency revenue growth of 8.5% and again at the center of our 7% to 10% long-term organic growth framework. Total mortgage revenue growth should be about 9.5%, about 24 points better than the about 15% decline from the USIS and EWS mortgage inquiries in our framework. Non-mortgage constant dollar revenue should grow over 10.5%, with organic growth of almost 8.5% and FX is about 190 basis points negative to our revenue growth. We expect Workforce Solutions to deliver revenue growth of about 8% in 2024. This reflects mortgage revenue at up just under 2%, about 15 points better than underlying EWS mortgage transactions. And EWS non-mortgage verticals are expected to grow almost 10.5%. Excluding the expected significant decline in ERC revenue as that pandemic support program completes, EWS non-mortgage revenue growth is about 12%, which is a strong performance given the expected weak hiring market in 2024 as well as the weaker overall U.S. economy. Talent in EWS is expected to grow about 7% despite a decline in our underlying markets and government is expected to deliver over 15% growth against a very strong over 30% comp last year. Twin record growth in NPI Vitality Index of over our 10% EFX goal and continued strong growth in both pricing and penetration will continue to drive EWS outperformance. We expect USIS to deliver revenue growth of almost 8% in 2024 at the high-end of their long-term growth target of 6% to 8%. Mortgage revenue is expected to grow over 20%, over 35 points stronger than the expected 16% decline in mortgage market inquiries. We are continuing to see substantial revenue benefits from both pricing increases from one of our largest USIS mortgage vendors that we pass on to customers at levels to maintain consistent margins and new product and pricing benefits by USIS. Non-mortgage revenue in USIS is expected to grow almost 4% despite modestly slower economic growth. The non-mortgage growth will be driven by continued strong commercial and identity and fraud growth as well as mid-single-digit growth in FI and auto. Consumer Services is expected to grow about 5% with financial marketing services expected to grow in the low single-digit percent. And we expect to see weaker revenue growth in D2C and telco. International had a very good 2023 with 6% organic constant dollar revenue growth but saw some weakening in end markets late in the year, particularly in Canada and Australia. We expect international constant currency growth to be over 15% in 2024 with organic constant currency growth of about 10%. The accelerating inflation we are seeing in Argentina is expected to benefit overall international revenue growth by over 5 percentage points. Although uncertain, we have assumed currency devaluation in Argentina will be more than offset by inflation in our 2024 planning. We expect our new product vitality index to be over 10% again in 2024, led by EWS in Latin America. As U.S. and IS and Canada principally complete their cloud transformation, we expect their NPI rollouts to accelerate as we exit 2024. For the full year, EBITDA is expected to be about $1.9 billion, up over 12% with adjusted EBITDA margins of about 33.3%. And adjusted EPS is expected to be about $7.35 per share, up about 9.5% from last year. Capital spending will decline by over $100 million to about $475 million or about 8.3% of revenue. The reduction reflects our progress in completing our cloud transformation and is a significant step towards our goal of 7% or below as we exit 2025. Now I'd like to turn it over to John to provide more detail on our 2024 assumptions and guidance and also to provide our first quarter framework. Our 2024 guidance builds on our strong 2023 non-mortgage growth from new products, record growth and pricing. John? John Gamble : Thanks, Mark. As Mark discussed, and as shown on Slide 14, our planning assumes a 16% reduction in mortgage credit inquiries in 2024. 1Q \u201824 is expected to see USIS mortgage credit inquiries down over 26% year-to-year with EWS twin inquiries at similar levels. Sequentially, as we move through 2024, we are assuming overall mortgage activity stays at about these levels with normal seasonality for the remaining quarters of 2024. Slide 15 provides a full year revenue walk, detailing the drivers of the 8.6% revenue growth to the midpoint of our 2024 revenue guidance of $5.72 billion. The blended about 15% decline in the U.S. mortgage credit and twin inquiries is negatively impacting 2024 total revenue growth by almost 3%. Mortgage revenue outperformance relative to the mortgage market at about 24 points is expected to benefit 2024 total revenue growth by about 4.5%, more than offsetting the almost 3 percentage points of negative revenue impact from the mortgage market decline. As a result, the expected about 9.5% increase in total mortgage revenue was a positive 1.5% impact on overall revenue growth. Non-mortgage organic revenue growth is expected to be about 8.5% on a constant currency basis and is driving about 7% of the growth in overall revenue. As Mark referenced earlier, the growth is within our long-term framework and is broad-based across all three BUs and again, the strongest performance in Workforce Solutions. The BVS acquisition completed last August is expected to contribute about 2 percentage points of revenue growth to 2024. Slide 16 provides an adjusted EPS walk, detailing the drivers of the expected 9.5% increase to the midpoint of our 2024 adjusted EPS guidance of $7.35 per share. Revenue growth of 8.6% at our 2023 EBITDA margins of 32.2% will deliver 12.5% growth in adjusted EPS. EBITDA margins in 2024 are expected to be about 33.3%, expanding about 110 basis points from 2023. The margin expansion delivers about 6 points of adjusted EPS growth. The expansion in margins is driven by the factors : organic constant dollar revenue growth in 2024 at about 8.5% is within our long-term financial framework. Consistent with that framework, we will generate about 50 basis points of margin expansion from high variable margins on our revenue growth. The cost reduction actions we executed in 2023 as well as actions related to the charge we announced this quarter will generate about $90 million in incremental spending reductions in 2024, of which about $60 million is expense savings in 2024 or about 100 basis points in EBITDA margin expansion. The actions we took in 2023 will generate an additional $65 million in spending reductions in 2024 on top of the $210 million of spending reductions in 2023. The cost action we announced this quarter will generate an additional $25 million in spending reductions in 2024. In 2024, cost savings we will generate from decommissioning of North American infrastructure in the second half of '23 will exceed the redundant system and migration costs we are incurring, generating about 30 basis points of margin benefit. Partially offsetting the about 180 basis points of margin expansion I referenced above, is principally higher variable compensation expense from the normalization of incentive and sales comp in 2024 that were at low levels in 2023 due to the substantial impact of the weak mortgage market on our performance. In 2024, our planning assumes we return to target levels of performance. As we look beyond 2024, the cost benefits of completing our cloud migration as well as accelerating high variable profit revenue growth are expected to drive significant improvement in EBITDA margins. In 2024, adjusted EBITDA should increase to about $1.9 billion, up 12.5% from 2023. Depreciation and amortization is expected to increase by about $60 million in 2024, which will negatively impact adjusted EPS by about 5%. D&A is increasing in 2024 as we accelerate putting cloud-native systems into production. The P&L line items below operating income, principally interest and other expense and tax expense, are expected to negatively impact adjusted EPS by about 4 percentage points. The increase in interest expense reflects the impact of higher interest rates and the increased debt from our BBS acquisition. Our estimated tax rate of about 26.7% is 50 basis points higher than the 26.2% in 2023, principally from higher foreign earnings. Slide 17 provides the specifics on our 2020 full year guidance that Mark discussed in detail. This slide includes additional detail on expected BU adjusted EBITDA margins as well as guidance on specific P&L line items. EWS EBITDA margins in 2024 at 52% are expected to be up from the 51% delivered in 2023, given strong non-mortgage revenue growth from new products, record growth, penetration and pricing, partially offset by the normalization of incentive comp. USIS EBITDA margins are expected to be about 34.5%, about flat with 2023. USIS is benefiting from revenue growth and 2023 cost actions. However, in the first half \u201824, USIS will have redundant systems costs as well as costs related to customer migrations prior to completion of migration of the consumer credit systems to Data Fabric. USIS is also being impacted by the normalization of incentive comp. International EBITDA margins at about 28% are expected to expand versus the 26.5% delivered in 2023, driven principally by revenue growth and good performance on 2023 cost actions. Corporate expense, excluding depreciation and amortization is increasing in 2024 relative to 2023 due to the increases in incentive and equity compensation from the lower levels incurred in 2023 that I referenced earlier. Corporate functions such as finance, legal, HR, corporate technology and others are managing costs consistent with the cost actions we have taken in 2023. As Mark indicated, capital spending should be about $475 million in 2024, down over $100 million from 2023. We believe that our guidance is centered at the midpoint of both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges. With EBITDA increasing to about $1.9 billion and capital spending declining to $475 million, we expect to deliver over 50% growth in free cash flow in 2024 versus the $518 million we delivered in 2023. At this level of EBITDA and free cash flow, our EBITDA leverage should decline from the current levels of about 3.2x to 2.5x as we complete 2024. We believe these levels of leverage are nicely within the levels required for our current BBB, Baa2 credit ratings. As we achieve these levels, we will have significant flexibility to begin to return cash to shareholders through dividend increases and share repurchases as well as continue to do bolt-on acquisitions. Slide 18 provides our guidance for 1Q '24. Revenue at the midpoint of guidance is expected to be about $1.385 billion, up 6.4% from 1Q '23. Constant currency growth is expected to be about 7.8%, with organic constant currency growth of about 4.7%. Non-mortgage revenue constant currency growth will be about 9.5%. Mortgage revenue should grow about 1% despite overall USIS and twin inquiry transactions being down about 26%. Business unit performance in the first quarter are expected to be as described below : Workforce Solutions revenue is expected to grow about 2% year-to-year. EWS mortgage revenue will be down about 15% and is expected to outperform underlying twin inquiries by about 11%. This mortgage outperformance is below the 18% we saw in 4Q as we lap the substantial growth in mortgage 36 volumes that occurred in the first quarter of '23. As we have discussed in the past, EWS long-term mortgage outperformance is expected to be about 11% to 13%, consistent with twin records, product and price levers that will drive overall Workforce Solutions' long-term revenue growth to 13% to 15%. Non-mortgage revenue should grow about 9% with Verifier non-mortgage revenue up 15%. Employer revenue will be down about 4% in the quarter due to the decline in ERC revenue that was referenced earlier. Excluding the significant decline in ERC revenue, total Workforce Solutions non-mortgage revenue will be up over 11% with employer up about 4.5%. EBITDA margins are expected to be about 50.5%, about flat year-to-year and down a little over 50 basis points sequentially, principally due to negative seasonal mix from higher employer services revenue in 1Q. USIS revenue is expected to be up about 9% year-to-year. Mortgage revenue will be up over 25%. USIS mortgage revenue is expected to outperform USIS credit inquiries by over 50% in the quarter. In the first quarter, we are benefiting from the significant price increases from a vendor that we discussed earlier as well as Equifax new product growth and pricing benefits. This level of outperformance versus the mortgage credit inquiries is expected to decline to under 30% as we move through 2024. USIS non-mortgage revenue is expected to be up about 3%. Non-mortgage will again be led by strong growth in commercial and identity and fraud and continued growth in FI consumer and FMS. EBITDA margins are expected to be about 32%, flat versus the first quarter of '23 and down about 300 basis points sequentially. In the first half of 2024, USIS is also incurring incremental costs from customer migrations to the Consumer Credit Exchange on Data Fabric. This is impacting 1Q '24 margins in addition to the seasonal decline in non-mortgage revenue and normalization of incentive compensation we referenced earlier. International constant currency revenue is expected to be up about 18%, representing about 4% organic constant currency growth from continued strong growth in Latam and Europe as well as mid-single-digit growth in Canada, offset by the decline in Asia Pacific discussed earlier. EBITDA margins are expected to be about 24%, up about 50 basis points versus 1Q '23, but down sequentially due to seasonally lower revenue in Canada and the UK, CRA and incentive costs. 1Q '24 Equifax EBITDA margins are expected to be about 29%, about flat with the first quarter of '23. As we discussed last year, corporate expense is much higher in the first quarter each year. The bulk of the expense related to our equity plans occurs in the first quarter and is reflected in corporate. Excluding the timing of equity compensation expense and the normalization of variable compensation in 2024, EBITDA margins would be over 32%. Corporate expenses will decrease meaningfully sequentially in 2Q '24 as the equity compensation was principally reflected in 1Q '24. We are expecting adjusted EPS in 1Q '24 to be $1.33 to $1.43 per share compared to 1Q '23 adjusted EPS of $1.43 per share. Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark. Mark Begor : Thanks, John. The unprecedented 50% decline in the mortgage market from normal 2015 to '19 levels had a significant impact on Equifax moving close to $1 billion of revenue over the past 24 months from our P&L. Against that unprecedented mortgage market decline, EFX's diverse mix of businesses delivered strong growth through outperforming the mortgage market by over 20 percentage points, strong 10% to 20% constant dollar non-mortgage growth, a 13% vitality index from new products and the addition of bolt-on acquisitions. As shown on Slide 19, based on our 2024 guidance, the U.S. mortgage market is on the order of 50% below its historic average inquiry levels. As the market bottoms and moves from a headwind to tailwind and the mortgage market recovers towards its historic norms, that represents over $1 billion of annual revenue opportunity for Equifax, none of which is reflected in our current 2024 guidance. At our mortgage gross margins is over $1 billion of mortgage revenue, we delivered over $700 million of EBITDA and $4 per share that we would expect to move into our P&L in '24, '25 and '26 as the market recovers. Wrapping up on Slide 20. Equifax delivered another strong and broad-based quarter with 14% constant dollar non-mortgage revenue growth, reflecting the power and breadth of the Equifax business model and strong execution against our EFX 2026 strategic priorities. We have strong momentum as we move into 2024. As we look at 2024, we expect to deliver 9% revenue growth and 110 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion from the revenue growth and our cost savings plans despite our expected about 15% decline in the mortgage market. As discussed on the prior slide, with the mortgage market bottoming, we expect mortgage to move from -- move to a tailwind over the next several years as the market returns to normal inquiry levels. A big priority for 2024 is to complete our North American cloud transformation as well as significant portions of our global markets, which will result in continued margin expansion and reductions in our capital intensity that is a key benefit of our data and technology cloud transformation. Exiting 2024 with 90% of Equifax revenue in the new Equifax cloud is a big milestone, so the team can move towards fully focusing on growth. We are entering the next chapter of the new Equifax as we pivot from building the new Equifax cloud to leveraging our new cloud capability to drive our top and bottom line. We are convinced that our new Equifax cloud differentiated data assets in our new single data fabric, leveraging EFX AI and ML and market-leading businesses, will deliver higher growth, expanded margins and free cash flow in the future. I'm energized by our strong performance in 2023 and the momentum as we enter 2024, but even more energized about the future of the new Equifax. And with that, operator, let me open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Unidentified Analyst : This is Brendan on for Manav. I just want to ask real quick on your -- you guys gave some more detail on the inquiries versus -- USIS versus twin. It sounded like you were saying next year, actually twin will be a little bit better because USIS is actually comping, I guess, better shopping activity. So it will actually be a little bit better than that down 16%. Just want to confirm that. And then why because obviously, this year, the inquiries on TWN have been quite a bit worse than the USIS side? John Gamble : Yes. So in your question, you gave a big chunk of the answer, right? So we do think what's happening is USIS is comping off of 2023 where shopping activity was extremely high. so that their growth -- their decline rate in 2024 will be less relative to that very high 2023 year because of the shopping activity. And we think that's probably the biggest driver that we're seeing. Also, quite honestly, as we talked about what we do is we take a look at current run rates in the market, what we're seeing in terms of growth rates year-on-year, and we just run them throughout the year. That's when we say we're using run rates. That's what we mean. And we're kind of seeing that as we take a look through the January and the latter part of December. So we think it's both consistent with what we're seeing and also with the description I gave. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then just one more on -- could you walk through some of your assumptions on talent like the volume assumptions that you're using? John Gamble : So I think what we indicated in talent, right, is that we're looking at BLS and BLS currently for the segments that we support is down about 10%. And we\u2019re just expecting that we\u2019re going to significantly outperform the markets we indicated by -- on the -- well over 10 points, right? So we feel very, very good about our ability to continue to grow talent despite the fact that we\u2019re going to see a hiring market that we think is probably going to be down in the order of 10%, which, again, is kind of what we\u2019re seeing so far this year. And in the -- sorry, and in the back half of the fourth quarter. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Andrew Sternerman with JPMorgan. Andrew Steinerman : John, could you just tell us how much mortgage revenues was as a percent of revenues in the fourth quarter? And also, could you just give us a sense of how much mortgage revenues have in terms of incremental margins in the '24 guide? John Gamble : So mortgage revenue in the fourth quarter was 15% of total. And for the fiscal year was 19%, right? And just for perspective, in the first quarter, it's going to be on the order of 20%, we think. A little under 20% based on the guidance we provided. That's driven by our outperformance in both EWS and USIS, that we talked about, Andrew. Mark Begor : Can you ask the second question again? Andrew Steinerman : Yes. What's the incremental margin on mortgage revenues assumed in the '24 guide? John Gamble : Generally speaking, we've talked about this in the past, right, is that our variable -- let's say, our gross margin on mortgage blended. And obviously, it's heavily dependent on mix because our margin on mortgage solutions, our tri-merge business is very different than our margin in the USIS business overall, which is obviously very different than our margin in EWS, right? With EWS having the highest margins, obviously of the three in general versus the blended USIS margins. But generally, what we\u2019ve indicated is you think something like 65% gross margins for the mortgage business. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Seth Weber with Wells Fargo. Seth Weber : Just on the guidance for 8.5% non-mortgage growth for 2024. Can you just talk to how we should be interpreting that in maybe just any areas where you think there could be some upside in your mind as we go through the year? Mark Begor : Well, we think the 8.5% is quite good. It's obviously inside of our 8% to 12% range, which is how we want to grow the company. We've talked about some of the pressures on our non-mortgage really in the talent market. And then second is the ERC impact, which that program has been curtailed by the IRS. And John talked about the impact that, that's having, which is on Equifax is a meaningful amount on a year-over-year basis. As far as upsides, I don't think we think about any upsides to that 8.5% because we think it's a pretty good growth rate. Seth Weber : Okay. Fair enough. And then can you just maybe talk to how much is left on the Medicaid determination here for the second quarter? How much is that like or -- sorry, through the first half of '24, how much that's going to contribute? John Gamble : Yes. So we haven't given specific dollar amounts. What we've indicated, right, is that it continues to be a benefit for us, it was in the fourth quarter, and we expect it will continue to be in the first and the second quarters. But then again, just as a reminder, right, redetermination is something that occurs consistently as part of benefits programs that are funded by the federal government. So yes, there was an accelerated redetermination program following the end of the pandemic freezes that occurred. But the fact is, as we go forward, we'll continue to see redetermination revenue across our government business, and it is -- it will be an ongoing driver of growth once we get through '24 and we get past the accelerated redetermination activity we're seeing right now. Mark Begor : And that's only one lever, obviously, for government vertical growth inside of Workforce Solutions, as we've talked about. As you know, that business was up super strong last year and again in '22, ended the year at over $500 million. So a very big business for us with big growth potential at the state level of continuing penetration. We've got a TAM there that's $3 billion plus against that $500 million. So there's a lot of opportunities to get the states that are not using our solution today. They're still using manual verification of income and employment, which is required for government social services. As you recall, we -- a couple of months ago, we landed a big extension to our CMS contract. It was $1.2 billion. That rolls into 2024. And then the new USDA contract that we signed in September was a new contract that obviously rolls into 2024. So there's a meaningful number of growth levers at government, and we're quite bullish as we talked about. We expect that business to be a big growth contributor to Workforce Solutions and outgrow Workforce Solutions 13 to 15 long-term growth rate, significantly outgrow that again in \u201824. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Kyle Peterson with Needham & Company. Kyle Peterson : Great. I appreciate you taking the questions. I wanted to touch on the non-mortgage growth that you guys called out in the guide. I think you guys have walked through some assumptions on kind of volume on mortgage and talent really well. I just wanted to see if you could provide any color for your volume assumptions around some other areas such as whether it's auto or cards, auto, consumer just to try to kind of figure out the delta between pricing and share versus volume trends in those markets? Mark Begor : I'd start with -- and I think we tried to be clear about that. We don't see any real change as we go into 2024 from those verticals like cards, auto, p loans, how they performed in the second half of last year. We talked a little bit about fintech was impacted in the second half of '22 and into '23, but that seems to be kind of a, I would call it, a stable level now, meaning it's not declining, which is good news versus the declines that happened last year. Large FIs are fairly consistent as far as they're still originating because consumers are strong. There's some choppiness with some of the smaller FIs that might be impacted by some liquidity stuff. But again, not a real change from what we saw in the second half of last year. Kyle Peterson : That make sense and is helpful. And I guess just a follow-up on capital deployment and priorities there. Just want to see how -- if you kind of prioritize where some of the near-term priorities are on the capital front, you mentioned leverage and eventually being to potentially buy back stock or increase the dividend. How are you guys thinking about some of those initiatives and priorities versus potential bolt-on M&A and kind of what's the near-term priority between the two? Mark Begor : Yes. So I'll go near term, which is 2024, I think we laid out that CapEx is coming down again this year in 2024. We expect it to step down again next year as we complete the cloud, big cloud completion in our USIS business and some of our international properties in the first half of this year and getting to 90% cloud complete will be a big milestone. So you're going to see our CapEx come down over the short term, meaning in '24 and over the medium term in '25 again as we complete the cloud. Over that timeframe, we expect our margins to continue to expand, which will grow our free cash flow. Our free cash flow this year is up almost 2x. John Gamble : It's well over 50% this year, yes. Mark Begor : So our free cash flow in 2024 is up substantially. We expect that to continue to grow as we get into '25 and '26. And so as you get over the -- again, back in '24, we have a pipeline of M&A that we're watching. I suspect that given we're already in February here that, that M&A would be in the second half if we do some. We're going to be very disciplined around M&A as we always have been. And we're focused on integrating the large number of acquisitions. We've done 14 in a little over three years that we're integrating like Boa Vista, as we talked about on the call. But when you get look forward to '25 and '26, we'll continue to add bolt-on M&A inside of that 8 to 12 framework that includes 1 to 2 points of revenue growth from bolt-on M&A. So that's clearly a part of our strategy. And we've been crystal clear that as our margins expand and we still have the goal of 39%, and we still have the goal of growing 50 bps a year post 39. As we move towards that 39% and our CapEx comes down, we would expect to have significant excess free cash flow when you get into '25 and '26, where we could look at restarting the dividend and also look at buying back meaningful amounts of our stock, and that's no change in that. We've been very clear in that over the last really three years that that\u2019s the goal we\u2019ve been working towards as we complete the cloud. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Kelsey Zhu with Autonomous Research. Kelsey Zhu : I think you have raised government TAM numbers, again, from $4 billion to $5 billion. I was wondering if you can give us a little bit more color on where the incremental upside comes from? And just in general, what are some of the major programs that you're targeting or states that you're trying to get in growth into that will bridge to this $5 billion TAM number? Mark Begor : Yes. And it's really around the government social services delivery, which is huge. There's 90 million Americans roughly that get some form of government social services, whether it's food support, rent support, cash support, childcare support, student lending support, all those different programs, unemployment support. All of those programs have to be verified by income and you have to verify employment and there's also an incarceration check on many of them, which is from our APRs data set. We've been growing rapidly there because of the real desire to deliver those social services quickly to those that deserve them and need them. And our instant data really delivers that. And we're competing, as you know, against manual processes and paper paste dogs, which means the recipient who's after the social services generally has to bring in proof of income. We can deliver it instantly. And of course, where our data is accurate, it's one to two weeks old depending upon the time frame because we're getting payroll every two weeks and we have such broad coverage. So our programs are really at kind of three levels at the federal, state and local level. We have federal programs where some of that verification is done at the federal level like with Social Security Administration. That's a large contract for us. We talked earlier in this call about the CMS contract that we extended. It's done at the federal, but then executed at the state level and the new USDA contract. And then we operate at the very state level and the state levels are more complex. There's a large, large penetration opportunity at the states. That's really where a big portion of our growth will come and a big portion of that TAM that you referenced is all the states -- all 50 states are not with Equifax, and it's really at the agency level, each state has separate agencies that deliver these services, and that's who our customers are. I think as you know, we've added resources over the last number of years at the state capital levels to work on deploying these resources. So we have a large pipeline. As you might imagine, we're focused on the large states : California, Texas, New York, Florida and some of the big, big states that are out there, but we have a focus on all of them. And as you go forward over the next '24, into '25, '26, that will be a big part of the growth is our penetration into the states to deliver these services. And it's a very strong value prop. In many cases, the data costs are subsidized by the federal government just as the social services are. So it's matter of getting the technology aligned with ours and helping change the process flow at each of those different agencies in all 50 states in order to deliver those. So we're very bullish about that business. As we said, it's close to $0.5 billion at the end of last year, and we expect strong double-digit growth again in 2024. John Gamble : I think one of the reasons the TAM is growing as we continue to integrate the insights business into Workforce Solutions fully. We're able to now see there's incremental products that can serve portions of that government market that we couldn't serve before. So I think the part of the increase in the TAM in addition to what Mark described is the broadening of our product set because of the Insights acquisition. So we feel very good how that's going to continue to allow us to broaden that TAM even further over time as we generate new products to service government needs. Kelsey Zhu : Got it. Super helpful. My second question is. I'm not sure if it's too early to talk about how you think about pricing for VantageScore 4.0 in the mortgage vertical. I think based on the FHA\u2019s original time line guidance; we should start transitioning towards that two score system later this year. And I think pricing decision for VantageScore is being made at the bureau level. So just curious to hear how you're thinking about setting prices for VantageScore for mortgage? Mark Begor : Yes. I think as you know, there's two pieces to that potential change by the regulator that is still in a comment period. One is to add Vantage to every federally supported mortgage. That's going to be a good guide for Equifax when it happens going forward. And then second is the 3B requirement going to 2B. We've talked before that we expect on the second half of that mortgage originators to continue to pull the three credit files because there are meaningful differences between the three credit bureaus, three credit files. For example, there's 8.5 million consumers that are only in one of the three credit files in the United States. So the value of three is quite important. On the Vantage plus FICO, same thing. It\u2019s still in a comment period. We haven\u2019t put either of those into our framework for 2024 because we\u2019re not sure they\u2019re going to happen or what the impact would be. But you point out that if it\u2019s a mandatory to have a FICO and Vantage score, that\u2019s a positive for our business to sell a second score in every mortgage. And no, we haven\u2019t thought about pricing on it because we really -- it\u2019s unclear if it\u2019s going to happen or when it will happen, if it does. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Heather Balsky with Bank of America. Heather Balsky : I wanted to ask first -- well, I guess two clarifying questions for you. One is the issuance metric for workforce on the mortgage side. I know that's something you guys introduced last quarter. Can you just help us again walk us through what that measure, kind of how you're getting to that number? And there's a lot of data out there around what issuance is. So just kind of helping us think through if we're comparing your number to kind of market data out there, what should we be thinking about? And then my second question is on the incremental margins on mortgage. I think last year, the 80% came up a fair amount, and I realize there's a mix impact, I think you said 65% earlier. Just trying to reconcile that, too. John Gamble : So I'll do the second one first. And so I think I was asked about what I gave as gross margins, right, so that people should think about gross margins. Incremental margins may be a little higher, right? They're going to be a little lower than the 80% that would have been talked about last year simply because there's been a significant price increase from one of our vendors. We pass it through. We do mark it up, so we can maintain EBITDA margins, but we don't -- we can't mark it up to maintain gross margins, right? So we did see -- we'll see some negative impact on variable margins on the mortgage business overall. Mark Begor : Regardless, incremental mortgage margins are super attractive. And we tried to be clear in including that our view of what normal mortgage volumes are in the 2015 to '19 range versus where we are today at 50% below that. There's a lot of upsides in '24, '25, '26, and we try to frame that in talking about the $1 billion of revenue potential in the future. On the second half of your -- or first half of your question about inquiries. The USIS inquiries because of shopping are different than the EWS inquiries, which generally are more involved in closed loans, meaning on the shopping side, someone will do shopping on two or three different mortgage originators, but close with only one. So that's the difference. And last year, we opted to try to disclose that data. You referenced market volume data that's out there. There really isn't any market volume data out there, except on a very long lag basis. There are forecasts which you can describe as data, I would call those forecasts and that data. And we talked about what MBA is forecasting and some of the others and some of the Street is forecasting improvements later in the year based on rate cuts that haven't happened yet for mortgage volume. We've been very clear, and we've been doing it since I've been here that we forecast mortgage volumes on the way up. We did it on the way down, and we're doing it currently based on our current trends. And as it changes, we'll share it with you. We tried to frame the positive potential impact on us on the top line as well as the bottom line as mortgage returns to normal. And again, we think over time, whether it's \u201824, \u201825, \u201926, mortgage volumes will return to normal. It's just uncertain when the Fed is going to make those rate changes and we'll be transparent on what our activity is because we see activity every day. And that's what we talk about when we talk about trends. We have -- we know what the inquiries are we got yesterday, and we know what they were last week and the week before, and we used those to really forecast what we think they're going to be going forward. Heather Balsky : I think -- I was curious more on the origination side, but potentially, the answer is kind of the same there. Mark Begor : It's actually, it's a little bit different. Originations, we don't get actual originations and the industry doesn't for until six months after they happen, somewhere in that time frame. It's a complex process for mortgages to close and then those mortgages to be posted in essence, on the credit file is when we see it. So the -- any mortgage origination data is actually on a lag basis. Obviously, there are forecasts that lots of people put together, but those are forecasts and not actual data. You can't determine what -- how many originations happened yesterday, that's just not available. Inquiries, yes, and we're super transparent with you about inquiries that we see on a current basis. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Shlomo Rosenbaum : First one, John, for you. Could you talk a little bit about maybe quantifying the duplicative cost and migration costs during the first half of '24? That should go away as you start to hit those milestones. And is there a substantial risk of some of this stuff kind of trickling into 3Q and 4Q in terms of just not necessarily getting all the clients to migrate? That's kind of the first question I got. John Gamble : Yes. So I think in the margin bridge, we talked about this, right? I think what we indicated is the net benefit is about 30 basis points in the year, right? And so what you can think about Shlomo's exactly as described, right, we're incurring incremental costs in the first half of the year. The bulk of which go away by the second half of the year, principally related to the North American migrations to the -- of the consumer credit file to Data Fabric. And so we see those incremental costs mostly occurring in the first half. Some of them continue, right, because we're continuing to do migrations in international, et cetera, but we see a substantial cost reduction or benefit from the elimination of the redundant costs principally and also the elimination of migration costs as you go into next year. So in total, it's 30 basis points for the year. The biggest part of the cost occurs in the first half. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. And then also just going back to kind of those inquiries forecast. I think last quarter, you said that based on what you were seeing in the market, the inquiries would be down around close to 15%. And it seems like that's the same forecast this quarter despite the fact that rates are -- have gone down. And I was wondering, did you kind of hone your forecast a little bit based on changes in shopping activity like -- can you talk about the difference in terms of -- or I guess the reason why you kept that forecast the same despite the fact that rates have gone down? Mark Begor : I think we did highlight that we saw some -- we used the term slight because they are slight improvements in, call it, the net last almost 60 days, which we view as a positive, which is why we're -- it feels like we're at a bottom in the mortgage market, which I think is a positive for Equifax. And when you look at Equifax at -- and again, we're calling a mark-to-market that's down. But meaning said differently, in a flat mortgage market, we grow our revenue because of our outperformance in both businesses through price product, more records in EWS and penetration in EWS. I think the 15, John, is kind of in the same ZIP code even with those slight improvements. But we'll continue to be transparent as we look forward. And we know you and many others on the call, are looking for an improvement in inquiries. We are, too. When it happens, we'll share it with you, and I think that's going to be a real positive for Equifax going forward. But we want to be consistent in how we forecasted for as long as I've been here around -- off of current trends because, look, we're not economists, we can't forecast where rates are going. None of us forecasted the rates last year and the increases. And as recently as this past weekend, I think the Fed kind of pushed out the potential rate decreases that many were expecting in March out to later in the year. So we think it\u2019s prudent to have a balanced forecast that\u2019s consistent with how we\u2019ve done it historically. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Unidentified Analyst : This is Guru on for Owen. Can you maybe please talk a little bit about the mortgage increased trends in January? Has it been -- was it better or has it trended down 16% full year expectation? Mark Begor : Yes, they're a little bit better than how we thought they would be when we gave guidance in October. That started in December, I said we called it slight improvements. But that's factored into the guidance we've shared with you this morning. So we've included that in the down 15%, and we'll continue to watch that closely. And watch it going forward. And obviously, we all know if, in fact, the Fed is going to take rates down. That's good news for our mortgage business in the future, which is why we tried to frame that $1 billion of potential revenue in the future as mortgage volumes return to more normal levels, and we expect them to return to normal levels. At these high rates, people are sitting on homes that they want to upgrade and move to that 4-bedroom home versus a three and they're waiting for rates to come down. Now what's that inflection point? We'll see. But the positive from our eyes is that it feels like the market has bottomed and with the Fed's managing inflation and indicating rate cuts in the future, that's going to be a good guide for Equifax and a tailwind going forward. The question is when? Unidentified Analyst : Got it. That's really helpful. Also, could you maybe please add some -- a little bit more color on how the 24% outperformance compared to the mortgage market figure was arrived at? I mean I know some of this has already been touched upon, but if you can maybe expand on that a little bit. John Gamble : Our overall mortgage outperformance lended USIS and EWS, right? So again -- so it's kind of two drivers, right? So we've talked about. We expect in the first quarter, for example, EWS outperformed by on the order of 11 points, and we think that's really driven by price and records, right? And then -- and product, as we said, we're lapping the launch of mortgage 36, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2022, right, and was kind of fully implemented in the first quarter of 2023. So we don't see the big product benefits that we saw in '23 recurring here in 2024. Over time, we will continue to launch new products. We do it very consistently across the business. and we should see that in mortgage as well, and that will continue to add to the outperformance in EWS. In USIS, obviously, the outperformance is extremely strong in the first quarter, right, on the order of 50 points relative to what we're seeing the market at. And again, it's really two big drivers. We've talked about it already. We've seen a substantial increase from a vendor that we passed through as part of our pricing and we mark it up to try to maintain our EBITDA margins. That is a little dilutive on our overall margins, but it is something that we generate significant incremental profit from. So we do mark it up to maintain EBITDA margins. We're also seeing some incremental growth because in the second half of last year, we saw some -- we saw acceleration in products that are sold very early in the mortgage cycle. And since they accelerated in the second half of last year relative to the first half of last year, we're seeing incremental growth relative to the mortgage market transaction levels in the first quarter of 2023 relative to what we would have seen last year. Mark Begor : On some new products that Equifax rolled out. John Gamble : And it's also the prequal products that have gone on across the industry. So that's why we're indicating as, as we move through 2024, we would expect the level of outperformance in USIS mortgage to decline as we lap the periods in which those prequal products were launched. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Toni Kaplan : I wanted to ask about the comment you made on the delinquencies. It seems like subprime has been getting worse approaching '09 levels, as you called out earlier. Do you see that spreading to near prime or prime? And I guess, so far, it hasn't -- you haven't seen changes in consumer behavior and things like that. But I guess, how do you think that this plays out? John Gamble : Yes. I've been in the financial services space for a long time. Obviously, here at Equifax for almost six years, but for 10 years, we're in what is now Synchrony. So I know the financial services space well. And personally, I don't. Yes, that's not my view that it's going to spread and primarily because unemployment is so low and employment is so high. As long as people are working, they have the capacity to maintain their financial obligations. And of course, financial institutions like meaning our customers are using data to make sure they're offering credit to those that can pay it back. So we're in an environment where unemployment really drives positives in most of the delinquency bands. Subprime has been pressured primarily because of inflation in what we see. While they're working that demographic inflation, whether it's heat, gas, groceries, all those have pressured that group. And then as a reminder, it's a small part, a small part, an important part, but a small part of the financial services ecosystem, meaning most of the lending that takes place in cards and auto is done in prime and near prime. Subprime is generally done today with fintechs. That's where most of the -- and they've tightened up starting in the summer of '22, almost 18 months ago. They started tightening up because they saw subprime consumers pressured by inflation, and they were getting pressured around their balance sheets because most of them are bank funded or securitization funded. So they had some pressures. So no, I don't see it as long as unemployment stays. The thing that we watch a lot and I watch a lot personally is where's unemployment. And as it stays low and it feels like it's going to stay low. I think we still have something like nine million jobs open with five billion people looking, and we're still generating net new jobs. So that's a good environment generally for the financial services industry. Toni Kaplan : Yes, makes a lot of sense. I wanted to ask a question on margins in a slightly different way. You talked about the moving pieces, very helpful bridge that you gave. And so the way I'm thinking about it is you have sort of the normal margin expansion from growth, you have the more cost savings than you previously expected. Better mortgage environment in the second half and then you have the redundant -- some of the redundant system costs going away in the second half. So basically, a lot of positives in second half of the year for margins. I guess where -- what kind of ballpark should we be thinking about exiting '24? And obviously, I'm trying to think about my '25 number. John Gamble : I think it's a little too early for us to begin in third and fourth quarter guidance. But look, we've said consistently, we expect to see nice margin improvements as we move through this year. And that's both sequentially and then relative to what we delivered last year. So we continue -- we expect that to continue to happen. I think you summarized what we talked about very well, right? And we do expect to see very good margin progression as we go through this year. And then obviously, to the extent that there was a mortgage recovery, which we haven\u2019t forecast, we should see accelerated margin expansion as that occurs, right, based on variable to gross profit margins that you apply against our mortgage. Operator : We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Trevor Burns for any closing remarks. Trevor Burns : I just want to thank you everybody for joining the call today. And do you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to myself or Sam. Otherwise, have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Trevor Burns, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Trevor. Trevor Burns : Good morning. Thanks. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Trevor Burns. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the IR Calendar section of the News & Events tab on our IR website. During the call, we'll be making reference to certain materials that can also be found in the Presentation section of the News and Events tab at our IR website. These materials are labeled 1Q 2024 earnings conference call. Also, we'll be making certain forward-looking statements, including second quarter and full-year 2024 guidance to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors that may impact our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2023 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. We will also be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted on certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and can be found in the Financial Results section of the Financial Info tab at our IR website. Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark. Mark Begor : Thank you, Trevor, and good morning. Turning to Slide 4, we're off to a strong start in 2024. First quarter reported revenue of $1.389 billion was up 7% at the high end of our February framework. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 29.1% were slightly above our expectations, and adjusted EPS of $1.50 a share was well above the high end of our guidance. Total U.S. mortgage revenue was up 6% in the quarter, stronger than expected. The strength in mortgage revenue was in USIS, where mortgage revenue was up 38% against credit inquiries that were down 19% and 700 basis points better than expected and continued strong performance in our new mortgage prequal products. EWS mortgage revenue was down 15% and consistent with our expectations. Twin inquiries are down 22% was slightly better than expected, and this was offset by slightly lower than expected revenue per inquiry, principally driven by product and customer mix. Our global non-mortgage businesses, which represented about 80% of total revenue in the quarter, had strong 9% constant currency revenue growth, which is well within our 8% to 12% long-term revenue growth framework. This was slightly below our expectation of 9.5% non-mortgage revenue growth. Non-mortgage organic constant currency record growth was 5% in the first quarter. At the BU level, EWS Verifier non-mortgage revenue was up a strong 15% and stronger than expected, driven by very strong 35% growth in government and good growth in auto and debt management, slightly offset by some verticals in talent. Employer revenue was down 10% and weaker than expected. This was principally driven by a more rapid decline in ERC revenue than we expected and delays in state government processing of WOTC claims. ERC is now at a run rate of 103 million a quarter and should stay at about that level for the rest of the year. For WOTC, the federal requirement for states to validate WOTC claims changed late last year and most states have not yet completed the changes required to process claims, which dampened our revenue in the quarter. This impacted our WOTC revenue in the first quarter, but we expect this to be a timing issue as this essentially creates a backlog of WOTC submissions that will have to be completed by the states that will begin turning to revenue as state processing accelerates in the remainder of 2024. Offsetting these declines in the quarter, we saw mid single digit growth in I-9 and onboarding revenue. And going forward, we expect employer revenue, including ERC, to be up low single digit percentages for the remainder of 2024. In total, EWS non-mortgage revenue was up 7% and overall EWS revenue was up 1% and adjusted EBITDA margins of EWS at 51.1% were over 50 basis points stronger than our expectations from strong operating leverage and strong performance. USIS had a very strong quarter with revenue up 10%, its highest quarterly revenue growth in three years, even against the 19% mortgage market decline. As I referenced earlier, mortgage revenue was up 38% and stronger than expected from mortgage and pricing pass-through and our new prequal solution. Non-mortgage revenue was up 1% and was weaker than expected. Although we had very strong double digit growth in Kount and consumer solutions and mid single digit growth in banking and lending, we saw double digit declines in third-party bureau sales and low to mid single digit declines in Telco and Auto. In USIS, adjusted EBITDA margins were up \u2013 were 32.7% in the quarter and up about 70 basis points higher than our expectations. International delivered 20% constant dollar revenue growth and 6% organic constant currency revenue growth, excluding the impact of the BVS acquisition, both of which were above our expectations. Very strong growth in Latin America and Europe was partially offset by lower than expected growth in Asia Pacific. International delivered 24.3% adjusted EBITDA margins, up slightly from our expectations. As you can see from the right hand side of the slide, we added a new strategic priority this year to focus on driving AI innovation. As mentioned in February, 70% of our new models and scores were built last year using AI and ML with a goal of 80% this year. In the first quarter, we exceeded this goal with 85% of our new models and scores being built with Equifax AI and Machine Learning. Equifax.ai, leveraging our proprietary data, Equifax Cloud and API capabilities, is a big area of focus and execution for Equifax in 2024 and beyond. We're maintaining our 2024 guidance with revenue at the midpoint of $5.72 billion and adjusted EPs of $7.35 a share. Our strong first quarter with revenue at the top end of the range, EPS above the top end of the range gives us confidence in our ability to deliver the full year guidance we provided in February. We expect strong constant dollar non-mortgage revenue growth of over 10% and our full year guidance is based on the assumption that the U.S. mortgage market continues at levels consistent with current run rates with U.S. credit inquiries down about 11% from 2023. Before I cover our business unit results in detail, I want to provide a brief overview of what we're seeing in the U.S. economy and with the consumer. Broadly outside of the bottoming of the mortgage market, there is not a lot of change from our view back in February. The U.S. consumer and our customers remain broadly resilient. Employment remains at historic levels with low unemployment, which is a positive for consumers and customers. Employment turnover and hiring at lower levels entering 2024 than last year, hiring levels in January and February were at their lowest levels in three years. This is more pronounced for higher salaried roles than lower salaried or hourly jobs. Credit card and auto delinquency rates for prime consumers, which represent about 80% of the market, are stable and at historically low levels of less than 1%, but above pre-pandemic levels and subprime credit card and auto delinquency rates continue to remain above pre-pandemic levels with auto subprime delinquencies above 2009 levels. As we've discussed before, it's our view that when consumers are working, they largely have the capacity to keep current under financial obligations, which is good for our customers and good for Equifax. Turning to Slide 5, workforce solutions revenue was up 1% in the quarter, slightly below our expectations. EWS mortgage revenue was down 15% as expected. Twin inquiries are down 22% or slightly better than expected, although weaker than USIS credit inquiries as homebuyers continue to have difficulty completing purchases while shopping behavior continues to be fairly strong. Our revenue outperformed inquiries by 7% which was below the about 11% we have guided during February relative to our February guidance, the benefit of the mortgage price increases implemented in January by EWS and stronger fulfillment rates due to the growth in twin records, whereas expected. However, these were partially offset principally by a shift in product and customer events. As we look to the remainder of 2024, we expect twin record growth to result in improved mortgage outperformance with the second quarter up slightly from first quarter levels and the second half of the year at about 14% outperformance. For the full year of 2024, we expect mortgage outperformance to be about 11% at EWS. This is down significantly from the 20% we saw last year as we lapped the late 2022 launch of our higher-priced Mortgage 36 trended data solution. Non-mortgage verification services revenue which represents over 70% of verifier revenue, delivered a very strong 50% growth at the top end of the EWS long-term revenue growth framework of 13% to 15% and was also above our expectations. Government, which is now our largest Verification Services vertical, had another outstanding quarter and was stronger than our expectations with 35% revenue growth. Government revenue benefited from both our new CMS and SNAP contracts, continued expansion of state contracts, continued TWN record growth and pricing. We expect continued growth in government throughout 2024 with stronger growth rates in the first half as post-COVID CMS redeterminations principally complete in the first quarter. Talent Solutions revenue was down 4% in the quarter which was weaker than expected as we saw very slow volumes through both January and February. Market saw about flat revenue which was more consistent with our expectations \u2013 which we expect to continue into the second quarter. Consumer lending revenue was 6% in the quarter as we saw strength in our auto and debt management businesses slightly offset by declines in card. This is the second consecutive quarter of consumer lending revenue growth as we're lapping headwinds from the FinTech lending pullbacks in 2022 and 2023. Auto and debt management revenue growth was principally driven by strong record growth and our pricing actions in the first quarter. As I referenced earlier, Employer Services revenue was down 10% compared to the \u2013 about 4% decline we discussed in February from ERC and ROIC reductions. Moving forward, we expect employer revenue, excluding ERC, to be up low single digits for the remainder of 2024. Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margins of 51.1% continue to be very strong from non-mortgage revenue growth, due to cost execution, while we continue to invest in new products, expanding the high growth verticals like government and talent, and grow our TWN records. As a reminder, EWS first quarter margins are seasonally lower from a higher mix of employer solutions revenue, principally from ACA and W-2 in the first quarter. Turning to Slide 6 and expanding on our discussion of EWS TAMs, in February, we provided additional details on our fast growing government vertical. On the left side of the slide, we outlined some of the federal agencies we're supporting with EWS Workforce Solutions, digital income, employment, and incarceration data that accelerate the time to deliver needed social services benefits to over 90 million Americans and help government agencies ensure program integrity, a win-win for all parties. And in the middle of the slide, you can see the substantial progress our EWS government vertical has made in a short period of time, penetrating the $5 billion TAM with a three-year CAGR of over 50%. We expect EWS to continue making significant progress penetrating the government vertical from additional sales resources at federal and individual state capital level, strong, clean record growth, new product rollouts with our differentiated incarceration data and system-to-system integrations enabled by our cloud-native technology that makes our solutions easier for our government customers \u2013 our government customers to consume. Our SSA contracts, last year's $1.2 billion CMS contract extension and the new $190 million SNAP contract are examples of our EWS involving various government agencies improve the consumer experience and their own operating efficiency, from the application and authentication phases to redetermination and recovery processes. The strength of the EWS government vertical was clear again in the quarter, and we expect strong future growth in this business in 2024 and beyond. Turning to Slide 7, EWS had another strong quarter of new record additions and signing new payroll processors. During the quarter, EWS signed agreements with two new payroll processors, including one large payroll processor that will contribute over six million current records to the TWN dataset. This added the six partnerships we signed in the fourth quarter that are coming online in the first half of 2024, and this brings the total number of payroll providers added to the TWN database to 35 since the beginning of 2021 and the pipeline for new records continues to be strong. Both of these wins in the quarter are a testament to EWS\u2019 ability to deliver the highest levels of client service from a technology, data security and accuracy, operational excellence, as well as the highest level of record monetization that EWS participates in a broad range of verticals including government, mortgage, talent solutions, talent screening, card, auto and personal loans. And given our advancements in AI and cloud-native capabilities, the time to board new records from payroll processes has decreased over the past few years. We expect these new record additions in the first quarter to come online and begin generating revenue in early third quarter. In the quarter, EWS added four million current records, growing the TWN database by 10% over last year. At the end of the quarter, the TWN database had 172 million current records on 126 million unique individuals. Total records, both current and historic, are now about 670 million and were up about 8%. These are very strong results given the typical churn in holiday season hiring in the first quarter. In terms of coverage, we have current employment records on about 75% BLS non-farm payroll and over 55% coverage on the estimated 225 million income producing Americans. At 126 million unique active records, we have plenty of room to grow the TWN database towards the TAM of 225 million income producing Americans. As shown on Slide 8, USIS revenue was up 10%, stronger than our expectations and well above their 6% to 8% long-term growth framework, principally due to stronger than expected mortgage revenue. As I referenced earlier, USIS mortgage revenue was up 38% and stronger than our expectations. Mortgage credit inquiries at down 19% were still down substantially, but 700 basis points above our February guidance. We also continue to see very strong performance from our new Mortgage Prequal solution. The strong pricing environment, along with the strength in our Prequal product drove the very strong mortgage outperformance of 57%. At $145 million mortgage revenue was just over 30% of total USIS revenue in the quarter. Non-mortgage revenue was up just over 1% and weaker than the above 3% growth we had expected. Third-party sales to credit bureaus, including Experian and TransUnion were down double digits in the quarter, excluding the impact of third party bureaus revenue, USIS non-mortgage revenue was up about 2% and closer to our February guidance. B2B non-mortgage online revenue growth was down less than 1% and below our expectations, again driven by lower third-party bureau sales into a lesser extent declines in auto \u2013 auto and telco. Offsetting these declines was strong double digit growth in Kount and very good mid single digit growth in banking and lending. Commercial revenue growth was up low single digits in the quarter. Financial Marketing Services our B2B off line business was down 1% and slightly below our expectations. Marketing revenue was down 4%, principally due to a 10% decline in IXI revenue versus a difficult comp in the first quarter last year. We expect IXI revenue to grow for the full year. Pre-screen marketing was down less than 1% and at similar levels to the quarterly revenue we had in 2023. We continue to see declines smaller FIs principally or partially offset by growth in larger FIs. Within risk and accounting reviews, we did see limited growth in our portfolio review business, but not to the level we would typically see if our customers were expecting a weakening economy. And fraud revenue was up a strong 8% from new business. USIS Consumer Solutions D2C business had another very strong quarter up 10% from very good performances in both our consumer direct and indirect channels. And USIS EBITDA margins were 32.7% in the quarter and higher than our expectations from stronger mortgage revenue growth. Turning now to Slide 9, International revenue was up 20% in constant currency and up 6% in organic constant currency, excluding the impact of International revenue was up 20% in constant currency and up 6% in organic constant currency, excluding the impact of BVS and above the 18% growth we guided to in February due to better-than-expected revenue in Europe and Latin America. Europe local currency revenue was up very strong 10% in the quarter from strong growth in our UK, CRE, CRA B2B consumer and direct-to-consumer channels as well as our debt management business. Latin America local currency revenue, excluding Brazil, was up 31% versus last year driven by strong double-digit growth in Argentina and Central America. Brazil revenue in the quarter on a reported basis was $41 million. We expect to make good progress on the BVS integration as we expect to implement Interconnect, our end-to-end decision platform this summer, for small- and medium-sized businesses and by year-end for large businesses, and implement Ignite, our advanced analytics platform by year-end. The combination of our Ignite and Interconnect platforms will bring significantly enhanced capabilities to both the business and to the Brazilian market. Canada delivered 4% in the quarter as expected. And Canada is on track to complete their migration to the Equifax Cloud in the second quarter. And similar to USIS, we expect to see accelerating NPI as they complete the cloud. Asia-Pacific revenue was below our expectations with revenue down 10% due to lower market volumes principally in our Australian commercial business. We expect Asia-Pacific to have declining revenue in the first half due to the softer market conditions and the near-term impact of long-term contract extensions we signed with several large customers. We expect Asia-Pacific to return to revenue growth in the second half of this year. International adjusted EBITDA margins of 24.3% were above our expectations due to revenue growth and continued strong cost management. Turning to Slide 10. We continue to make very strong progress with new product innovation, launching over 25 new products in the quarter with a 9% up Vitality Index from broad-based strong performances across all of our BUs. As a reminder, our VI measure includes NPIs for the last three years. And on January 1, drops out NPIs or on January 1 dropped out NPIs from all of 2020. While our first quarter VI was slightly below our long-term goal of 10% as we lacked a large EWS Talent Solutions product launched in 2020, we expect our quarterly VI to accelerate throughout the year leveraging our EFX Cloud capabilities to drive new product rollouts for the full year 2024 VI of over 10%. Consistent with the fourth quarter of last year, USIS delivered another strong quarter with VI of 7% as we're closer to cloud completion and able to leverage our new cloud native infrastructure for innovation in new products, such as our suite of Ignite solutions including Ignite for prospecting and Ignite for financial services. EWS delivered VI of over 10%. We expect EWS VI to accelerate throughout 2024 with new product introductions focused on incarceration data, mortgage prequal and I-9 and onboarding products. As I mentioned earlier, EFX.AI is a pillar of our EFX2026 strategic priorities enabled by our EFX Cloud. In the middle of the slide, you can see that we're accelerating the pace at which we are developing new models, scores and products using AI and machine learning. In the first quarter, 85% of our new models and scores were built using AI and ML, which is ahead of our 2024 goal of 80% and last year's 70%. NPI and AI are a clear focus for Equifax, which will drive innovation that can increase the visibility of consumers to help expand access to credit and create new mainstream financial opportunities as well as drive EFX top line growth and margins. Before I turn it over to John, I want to spend a few minutes on our progress on two of our critical EFX2026 strategic priorities that support our long-term growth framework of 8% to 12% top line growth and 50 basis points of annual margin expansion. Completing the cloud and inhibiting from building and leveraging our cloud capabilities is a big 2024 priority, which is fundamental to accelerating NPI and execution of AI and more broadly analytics as well as substantially strengthening system response time and resilience of our technology for our customers. Completing the cloud also frees up our team to fully focus on growth and expanding innovation, new products and new markets. Our progress towards completing the cloud is gaining momentum with over 70% of our total revenue in the new Equifax Cloud at the end of the quarter. And we're focused on executing the remaining steps to reach 90% with Equifax revenue in the cloud by year-end. USIS expects to complete their consumer credit, mortgage and telco and utilities exchange customer migrations to the new Equifax Cloud data fabric principally in the third quarter, which will allow them to decommission legacy systems in the second half of this year as planned. Customer feedback from the thousands of customers that we migrated to Equifax Cloud year-to-date has been very positive. Canada is progressing as planned to complete their consumer credit exchange migrations to the data fabric in late second quarter of this year with their data center decommissioning planned for the third quarter. Europe continues to make significant progress with the goal of completing Spain's consumer exchange migration to data fabric and the decommissioning of their legacy systems in the third quarter. And UK is on schedule to complete cloud migrations, decommissionings of their technology and data centers in the first half of 2025. In Latin America, we completed the Argentina and Chile cloud migrations and expect to make substantial progress on the remaining Latin American countries throughout the rest of 2024. And lastly, as planned, we expect Australia to make big progress this year towards completing their consumer credit exchange migrations to the Equifax Cloud in 2025. Second, driving AI innovation is an important EFX2026 strategic priority that leverages our cloud-based data fabric and application architecture and global Ignite analytical and Interconnect decisioning platforms. We're making great progress in embedding these EFX.AI capabilities across our global footprint. Ignite and Interconnect are now broadly available worldwide. And during 2024, we're deploying both Equifax proprietary explainable AI along with Google Vertex AI across Ignite, Interconnect and our global transaction systems. For Equifax, Vertex AI enables faster and more predictive model development on our Ignite platform. And for our clients, Ignite, which combines data analytics and technology into one cloud-based ecosystem, customers can connect their data with our unique data through our identity resolution process to gain a single holistic view of consumers. We now have 100 \u2013 access to 100% of the U.S. population through our data sets in our single data fabric. This is expanding the global population of its consumers for our customer cases by over 20%. And we're driving faster data ingestion and analytics with greater than five times the processing power of our legacy applications tied into our clients' existing campaign, account management and business platforms. Completing the cloud and expanding EFX.AI, along with continued expansion of our differentiated data sets will accelerate innovation and new products at Equifax will drive both our top and bottom line. In the first quarter, we're also off to a good start on our broader operational cloud restructuring plan across Equifax, reflecting cost reductions from the closure of North American data centers and other broader spending controls against our $300 million goals. These actions are improving operating margins and lowering the capital intensity of our business. We're entering the next chapter of new Equifax as we pivot from building the new Equifax Cloud towards leveraging our new cloud capabilities to drive our top and bottom line. And now I'd like to turn it over to John to provide more detail on our first quarter financial results and to provide our second quarter framework. Our second quarter guidance builds on our strong first quarter performance from new products, record growth and pricing. John? John Gamble : Thanks Mark. Turning to Slide 11. First quarter mortgage market credit inquiries were down about 19% and TWN mortgage inquiry volumes were down 22%. We believe homebuyers continue to have difficulty completing purchase transactions, resulting in a continuation of shopping, which generally results in credit inquiries, which occur earlier in the purchase process being stronger than TWN inquiries. Consistent with our practice from the first quarter and the last several years, our guidance for both credit inquiries and TWN inquiries is based on our current run rates over the last two to four weeks modified to reflect normal seasonal patterns. For both credit and TWN inquiries, we saw some weakening in trends in late March and early April as mortgage rates increased over that period. Mortgage credit inquiry run rates remain somewhat better than the guidance we provided in February. Our guidance reflects mortgage credit inquiries to be down about 13% in the second quarter of 2024 and 11% in calendar year 2024, about 600 basis points and 500 basis points better than our February guidance, respectively. Our guidance reflects TWN inquiries at about the levels we discussed in February with TWN inquiries down about 19% in Q2 and down about 14% for the year. This reflects the continuation of mortgage shopping we saw in the first quarter. As a reminder and as we discussed in February, we expect the level of USIS mortgage revenue outperformance to moderate as we move through 2024 as we start to lap the growth in new mortgage prequal products. We expect 2Q USIS mortgage outperformance to be about 40%, down from the 57% in the first quarter with full year USIS mortgage outperformance also expected to be on the order of 40%. We expect TWN revenue mortgage outperformance in the second quarter to be up slightly from the 7% we saw in the first quarter. As Mark indicated, second half 2024 mortgage outperformance should be about 14% with full year about 11% and at the low end of our long-term 11% to 13% framework. Slide 12 provides the details of our 2Q 2024 guidance. In 2Q 2024, we expect total Equifax revenue to be between $1.41 billion and $1.43 billion with revenue up about 8% at the midpoint. Nonmortgage constant currency revenue growth should strengthen to about 11%. Mortgage revenue in the second quarter is expected to be up about 3%. Mortgage revenue will be just over 20% of Equifax revenue. FX is negative to revenue about 2 points. Business unit performance in the second quarter is expected to be as follows. Workforce Solutions revenue growth is expected to be up about 3%, with mortgage revenue down about 12.5%. EWS nonmortgage revenue should grow over 9% in the quarter. Nonmortgage Verifier revenue will again be up about 15% in the second quarter driven again by government and a return to growth in Talent Solutions. And Employer Services revenue is expected to decline about 4% in the quarter due to declines in ERC revenue. Excluding ERC, Employer Services revenue should be up slightly. We expect Employer Services to return to revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2024 as we lap ERC headwinds. EWS adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to again be about 51%. USIS revenue is expected to be up over 8% year-to-year, despite the continued decline in mortgage market inquiries. Mortgage revenue should be up over 25%. Non-mortgage year-to-year revenue growth of over 2% should be up from the 1% we saw this quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be up strongly to about 34.5%. International revenue is expected to be up over 20% in constant currency due to the addition of BVS. Revenue is expected to be up approaching 10% in organic constant currency. EBITDA margins are expected to be about 25.5%, reflecting revenue growth. We expect Brazil to deliver revenue of over $40 million in the second quarter. Equifax 2Q 2024 adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be about 32% at the mid-point of our guidance, an increase sequentially of about 300 basis points, principally reflecting the higher equity compensation expense we saw in the first quarter. Adjusted EPS in 2Q 2024 is expected to be $1.65 to $1.75 per share about flat versus 2Q 2023 at the mid-point. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were about $125 million and consistent with our expectations. We expect capital expenditures in the second quarter to be at levels consistent with the first quarter and we continue to expect CapEx to be about $475 million for the year, which is a year-to-year reduction of over $100 million. As we discussed in February 1 of our capital allocation priorities in 2024 is leverage reduction from free cash flow expansion. As of the end of the first quarter, our leverage ratio was just over 3 times with a goal by year-end 2024 of about 2.5 times. We believe these levels of leverage are nicely within the levels required for our current BBB, Baa2 credit ratings. As we achieve these levels, we will have significant flexibility to begin to return cash to shareholders through dividend increases and share repurchases, as well as to continue to do bolt-on acquisitions. As Mark covered earlier, we are making very good progress on completing migration of our U.S. and Canadian consumer credit exchange changes to cloud, which will enable the shutdown of significant legacy systems in 3Q and 4Q. These actions enable significant cost benefits in the second half of 2024, which will allow us to deliver sequentially higher EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS in 3Q and 4Q. Slide 13 provides the specifics of our 2024 full year guidance, which is overall unchanged from the full year guidance we provided in February. Consistent with our February guidance, constant currency revenue growth is expected to be about 10.5% with organic constant currency revenue growth of 8.5% at the center of our 7% to 10% long-term organic growth framework. Total mortgage revenue is now expected to grow over 10%, reflecting USIS mortgage revenue that is stronger than our February guidance. Total mortgage revenue is expected to grow more than 20 points better than the about 13% reduction from the average decline in USIS and EWS mortgage inquiries in our framework. Non-mortgage constant dollar revenue should grow over 10% with organic growth of over 8%. This is solidly within our long-term framework, although slightly below the levels we discussed in February. FX is about 190 basis points negative to revenue growth. We have also slightly adjusted BU level guidance. We expect Workforce Solutions to deliver revenue of about 7% in 2024. This reflects mortgage revenue down slightly about 11 points better than underlying EWS mortgage transactions. EWS non-mortgage verticals are expected to grow about 10%. The slight decline from February guidance is due to the expected weaker revenue performance in employer driven by the more rapid decline in ERC and deferral of WOTC revenue Mark referenced earlier. Excluding the expected significant decline in ERC revenue as that pandemic support program completes, EWS non-mortgage revenue growth is about 12%. We expect USIS to deliver revenue growth over 9% in 2024 above the high end of our long-term growth target of 6% to 8%. Mortgage revenue is expected to grow over 25% on the order of 40 points stronger than the expected over 11% decline in mortgage credit inquiry. Non-mortgage revenue is expected to grow about 3%, down from the 4% in our February guidance. We continue to expect non-mortgage growth will be driven by strong consumer services, commercial identity and fraud and FI. As we saw in the first quarter, the overall auto market was weaker than our expectation impacting our auto based revenue and our D2C revenue the business in which we sell credit dated to other credit bureaus was weaker than we expected and down substantially. We continue to expect international to deliver constant currency revenue growth of over 15% in 2024 with organic constant currency growth of about 10%. As we discussed in February, the high levels of inflation we are seeing in Argentina are expected to benefit overall international revenue growth by about 5 percentage points. Although uncertain, we have assumed the currency devaluation in Argentina will more than offset inflation in our 2024 planning. We believe that our guidance is centered at the mid-point of both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges. Turning to Slide 14 and as we discussed in February, the U.S. mortgage market is on the order of 50% below its historic average inquiry levels. As the market bottoms and moves from a headwind to a tailwind and the mortgage market recovers towards its historic norms that presents over $1 billion of annual revenue opportunity for Equifax, none of which is reflected in our current 2024 guidance. At our mortgage gross margins, this over $1 billion of mortgage revenue would deliver over $700 million of EBITDA and $4 per share that you would expect to move into our P&L. Now, I\u2019d like to turn it back over to Mark. Mark Begor : Thanks, John. Wrapping up on Slide 15, Equifax delivered another strong quarter with 9% constant dollar non-mortgage revenue growth, which was well within our 8% to 12% long-term revenue growth framework, reflecting the power and breadth of the Equifax business model and strong execution against our EFX 2026 strategic priorities. As I mentioned at the beginning of my comments, a big priority for 2024 is to complete our North America cloud transformation as well as significant portions in our global markets, which will result in continued market expansion and reductions in our capital intensity as the key benefit of our data and technology cloud transformation. As we complete the cloud, we expect CapEx to increase in 2024 by over $100 million to about $475 million or under 8.5% of revenue with further reductions in 2025 allowing us to move towards our long-term CapEx goal of 7% of revenue as we exit next year. And exiting 2024 with 90% of Equifax revenue into new Equifax Cloud is a big milestone, so the team can move fully towards focusing on growth. Aligned with completing the cloud transformation is our strategic priority to drive innovation through our investments in EFX.AI. AI, ML are changing the way we develop new products in our single data fabric, build higher performing models, scores and products allow us to inject and cleanse more data and operate our consumer care centers more efficiently. We are on offense with EFX.AI. We are entering the next chapter of the new Equifax as we pivot from building new Equifax cloud to leveraging our new cloud capabilities to drive our top and bottom line. We are convinced that our new Equifax cloud differentiated data sets in our single data fabric leveraging EFX.AI and ML and market leading businesses will deliver higher growth, expanded margins and free cash flow in the future. We remain focused on executing our long-term model, delivering 8% to 12% revenue growth with 50 basis points of annual margin expansion annually. I\u2019m energized by our strong performance in the first quarter and momentum as we begin 2024, but even more energized about the future of the new Equifax. And with that operator, let me open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is alive. Manav Patnaik : Thank you. Good morning. I just had a broader question on just the visibility that you have because unlike the prior years, mortgage is actually much better than what you guys guided. But still there were, I think, a lot of moving pieces that didn't allow you to beat by more, I guess. Just curious I think this quarter, obviously, ERC was exceptional, but auto, APAC like, just \u2013 can you just help us understand how much visibility you have in these other areas? Mark Begor : Yes. Manav, good morning. I think we have good visibility. We typically do, as you know, but there's still a lot of uncertainty. As you know, you go back using your comment on mortgage, 60 days ago, I think a lot of us were looking forward, as well as most of the experts that we have multiple rate cuts in 2024 as recently as two weeks ago, there were still people thinking there was going to be a June cut. And I think, as you know, that's kind of pushed out. Rates went up three weeks ago, two weeks ago, mortgage rates went up 20 basis points to 7%. So while there's a lot of visibility, there's still a lot of uncertainty around, I would call it, principally the mortgage market. And given we're in the first quarter, we thought it was prudent to be balanced in the framework we put forward. As you know, we beat in the first quarter. We had some things to manage in ER spend, EWS like the ERC decline or the WOTC deferral because of the change in forms. And there's always things we're managing as a company. But we thought it was prudent to be balanced given where we are in the quarter and kind of the macro of mortgage, outside of mortgage, we're pretty comfortable with the economy. And we held the year and we'll take another look at it as we go through second quarter. Manav Patnaik : Okay, got it. And then just the 7% mortgage outperformance in EWS, I know you guys had said that you expected 1Q to be the low end or the low point was seven, kind of in line with your expectations and then just thinking about the 11 for the year and beyond. Is that going to be the new norm then? Mark Begor : Yes. So we've had very strong mortgage outperformance at EWS over the last couple of years, records are a big driver of that. Obviously, we take price up every year, which we did in 2024. We've also had in the last couple of years what I would call outperformance in EWS mortgage from some of the new product introductions, principally Mortgage 36. So that's kind of the delta from 2024 outperformance, call it in the high teens to 20, down to the double-digit or low single digits. So we were kind of focused on that. As we look forward to the balance of the year, you heard us talk about the record additions which are going to benefit all of the EWS verticals, including mortgage, including the larger payroll processor that we signed. It's going to come online, kind of mid-year, that's going to add 6 million records. So those higher hit rates will benefit all of the EWS businesses in the second half as we continue to grow twin records, and also will benefit mortgage. John Gamble : Relative to our expectation for the first quarter, seven was a little lower than we expected. As we said in the script, it was really driven a lot by customer mix and channel mix, right. We saw some shifts in our customers and to some of our customers that had lower pricing than others, and that impacted our first quarter outperformance levels. Going forward for the rest of the year, we basically assume that level of mix is going to continue. And as Mark said, the growth is really driven by records. Long-term, I think we've said before that we're expecting mortgage outperformance to look pretty much like the level of outperformance excluding economy \u2013 of the economy that we're talking about for EWS in general, which is something like 11%, 12%, 13%. So I think long-term, that's the type of level we're thinking about. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Your line is outline. Andrew Steinerman : Hi. John, could you go back to the Slide 11 and the 500 basis point better assumption on a USIS mortgage credit inquiries for 2024. Does that translate into 500 basis points better mortgage revenue growth for OIS? And if not, why? And I'm going to give you my second question. We'll also make a comment about mortgage solutions trajectory for the year. John Gamble : So it translates into better mortgage revenue for USIS in total, not necessarily specifically for OIS, right. So you need to look at both OIS as well as core mortgage. But yes, inquiries translate fairly directly. Yes. Andrew Steinerman : And the other part was, could you just talk about mortgage solutions trajectory for the year? John Gamble : So again, what we're talking about is just mortgage in total, right. So and I think the trajectory for mortgage in total is what we talked about on the call, right. So we didn't really split mortgage solutions and OIS. We manage it as one kind of one single business. I understand it's on two different line items when we report, but we tend to focus on mortgage in total and trying to drive the mortgage performance overall up for the year. And I think we gave very specific information about what we expected overall mortgage is very strong, up over 25% for the full year, right, outperformance on the order of 40 points. So we think it's going to be very strong in total. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Kyle Peterson from Needham and Company. Your line is now live. Kyle Peterson : , : Mark Begor : I missed the first step \u2013 the first half of your question about if rates stay higher for longer, how does it impact Equifax? Kyle Peterson : Yes, got it. Mark Begor : Yes. So mortgage, I think you get \u2013 mortgage, obviously this year, we're still expecting mortgage to be down. But like, if rates stay where they are, we would expect in 2025, mortgage market to be fairly flat, in 2025 until rates come down. And I think John outlined again, what we believe that whether it's 2025, 2026 or 2027, as rates get down to what I would call a more normal level, as you know, we're at a 20-plus year high right now. Over that longer timeframe, there's a big tailwind in mortgage. For the rest of our businesses, we haven't really been impacted by rates. There's a little bit of impact in auto, those higher rates are pressuring some of the payments, if you will, for that lower end consumer and subprime and near prime. But broadly, we're performing well, where rates are from a non-mortgage standpoint, and we would expect that to continue. So when we think about kind of the long-term of Equifax, we're still committed and confident in our 8% to 12% kind of long-term framework for the company, including a point or two of M&A in that long-term framework, and that's \u2013 it's kind of current rates. And then we've got the benefit is rates come down to some level where they're going to come down to four or three and a half or whatever over the long-term. I don't think any of us expect them to go back to where they were kind of during the COVID pandemic. But as they come down, we're going to have \u2013 we believe a real tailwind as the mortgage market recovers from its levels of 50% below what we would characterize as normal. John Gamble : And just as a reminder for 2024, right, as we said in the script, our guidance reflects current activity, current run rates, which is at current rates, right. So effectively, our guidance assumes rates stay where they are. Kyle Peterson : Got it. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up, we've seen some consolidation. The background screening space, I know some of that's at least pending right now, but I just wanted to get your thoughts on if we do see some consolidation there. Is there any change in your strategy or outlook on Talent, within Appriss, the TWN products or is everything just pretty much dependent on hiring volumes? Mark Begor : Yes. I wouldn't say, it's all dependent on hiring volumes. Obviously, hiring volumes have had an impact on us. We've been able to navigate through the hiring volumes, which are still quite low. Most companies are keeping a tight belt, as they think about where the economy is going. As far as hiring on the white collar side, obviously blue collar is super strong. There's, I don't know what is 9 million plus open jobs right now, but it's still a very vibrant economy from the hiring side. As far as that talent, we just see a big TAM there with lots of opportunity to grow. We have strong relationships with all the top players, including the two you mentioned, and we expect to continue those relationships. We've got a very aggressive pipeline of new product additions that we're continuing to roll out in the talent space. There's a lot of white space for us to penetrate, meaning background screeners that are still using manual, if you will, employment verifications. So that's an opportunity for us. So we remain very optimistic around the future for the talent vertical. And as you point out, when hiring, I would call it in the white collar side stabilizes or perhaps when rates come down and there's some increase in economic activity, we'll get some tailwind from the market side as people are expanding their businesses, and then we'll have things under our control to continue to adding records. The additional records result in higher hit rates there. The 4 million records we added in the quarter are 4 million jobs, that are now going to be able to be monetized in the hit rates we\u2019re delivering at talent. I talked about new products, and of course, we took some price up in January and we\u2019ll do that again in 2025. So we\u2019re optimistic about talent. We\u2019re super optimistic about government. As you know, with the 35% performance in the quarter, which is we see a lot of opportunities there, too. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Heather Balsky : Hi. Thank you. I wanted to go back to the EWS outperformance versus the volume. And you talked a little bit about customer shift and it\u2019s something, I guess, that hasn\u2019t come up in the past. Curious if you could dive in a little bit more in terms of kind of what can drive a shift in the sort of mix of customers that you\u2019re working with and how you\u2019re thinking about that for the rest of the year. And is it a function of how the mortgage market is performing or is it new customers that you\u2019re bringing in? Just help us understand that better. Mark Begor : It\u2019s a little bit of all of the above, but it\u2019s really the mortgage market now at the low levels of activity, down 50% from where it was. There is some changes that happen on how much volume specific customers are completing in a quarter or a month. And we see shifts in that that are, I would call it more pronounced when the numbers are smaller. If you have one mortgage originator that perhaps is being more aggressive at one point in time or when the originations, they want to do their marketing, they\u2019re spending. As you know, a lot of this is \u2013 most of it\u2019s done digitally. So there\u2019s ebbs and flows on, particularly in this market from what we\u2019ve seen, ebbs and flows of kind of the activity that a mortgage originator will put into it. I don\u2019t know John, what else would you add? John Gamble : Let me just add. Just got to remember a point about performance is not a large number, right? So we can see shifts about performance of several points, and it isn\u2019t a really large number on our mortgage revenue. And that\u2019s why you saw that we had a little bit of outperformance in inquiries. And yes, we had some out \u2013 we had some underperformance and outperformance, but we ended up with revenue on, right? So I think unfortunately what we\u2019re talking about here is really small percentages that can be impacted by not large movements in revenue. And that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing here, right? But overall, Mark covered it already, right, the real driver here of this business is consistent, large growth in records, which makes the product more valuable, which is why we expect to see continued improvement in the level of mortgage revenue as we go through the year, relatively speaking. So we feel very good about what\u2019s going on with the products we\u2019re offering because of the fact that we\u2019re adding records so rapidly. Heather Balsky : Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And as a follow-up question, as it relates to margin, you did take your inquiry number up on the mortgage side, so just curious how to think through. But if you maintain your EBITDA outlook for the full year, just sort of give and take there in terms of the flow through on higher increase and what might be offsetting that. Mark Begor : Yes. I think I\u2019d start with the comments I had earlier. I don\u2019t know if you heard my response to Manav question. The first quarter, we still \u2013 a lot of \u2013 we have a lot of visibility in lots of parts of the business. I think the mortgage side is less visible as was pointed out. 60 days ago, all of us thought there\u2019d be \u2013 at least the world thought there would be a bunch of rate cuts in the second half, including one in June. Two weeks ago, the June 1 felt like it disappeared. So, given it\u2019s the first quarter, we were very pleased with what we saw as revenue being kind of the midpoint of our guidance, which is very strong and then EPS outperformance. We thought it was prudent to hold the year and give you a good outlook of what we think second quarter is. And as I said, we\u2019ll look at it again as we get through second quarter and have, what I would characterize is more visibility. I think any of us expected inflation to, so called spike up a little bit in the last couple of months, when we set that guide earlier in the year. But we\u2019re confident in delivering the full year guidance that we laid out and we\u2019ll give you an update as we get through second quarter, we\u2019ll have more visibility at that time. John Gamble : As you look through the year, we are expecting margins to go up. It\u2019s obvious in our guidance, right? I talked a little bit about the fact that we have meaningful cost reductions coming as we decommission major systems in our consumer businesses in North America. We feel good about executing against those as Mark talked about. We also just \u2013 you\u2019ve got to remember we generally have an improving mix of revenue as we go through the year, especially in the fourth quarter as mortgage declines as a percentage of our revenue. It happens every year. It\u2019s just market, right? So as that happens, that tends to be margin accretive for us. So executing against our plans and quite honestly, the addition of records in EWS is very accretive for us as we go because obviously that\u2019s very high margin revenue that doesn\u2019t draw with it expense below variable cost. So we feel very good about our ability to deliver on our full year numbers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Owen Lau from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live. Owen Lau : Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I want to go back to talent. I think you mentioned the Jan and Feb volume was I think below expectation, but March number is better. And you expect that trend to continue. I just want to understand the driver of that weakness in Jan and February. And what makes you confident that the volume would be similar to March level maybe in the second quarter or so? Thanks a lot. Mark Begor : Yes. We attribute when we talk to our customers, which are background screeners, that kind of softer January, February, just as kind of a very tight operating environment that most companies are operating on. Again, we over skew to white collar workers versus blue collar. Blue collar is still, I would call it red hot, meaning there\u2019s more jobs open than people looking for them. That\u2019s not the issue. Most companies are really watching the economy and we saw that in January, February. We did see an uptick in March and we try to operate off current trends we see and that\u2019s still continuing in April and we expect that to kind of stay at that level. But I wouldn\u2019t call it like a big recovery, just back closer to what we thought the year was going to be as we exited 2023. Owen Lau : Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. And then for your cloud migration from, I think 70% revenue to 90% cloud revenue by the end of this year. Can you help us again, how should we \u2013 how can we quantify these uplifts and translate that to revenue growth and margin expansion? And how much of that you\u2019re baked that into your full year guidance already? Thanks. Mark Begor : Yes, certainly in our guidance, obviously, we haven\u2019t given guidance for 2025 yet. We\u2019ll do that as we get through this year, we expect those cloud completions this year to benefit 2024. That\u2019s built into our margin expansion assumptions in 2024. And then there\u2019ll be some carryover of the second half decommissioning that we have as we complete, like the USIS cloud transformations in the kind of middle of the year and some of the international cloud transformations, same kind of timeframe, those start layering in on kind of a monthly basis as we go through this year. And those will provide some benefits as we go into 2025. So I think we\u2019ve given and we\u2019re happy to share some more around the margin side. The top line side is one, there\u2019s multiple layers of how the cloud is going to benefit us from a top line standpoint. We\u2019re going to be a differentiated partner to our customers with the always on stability from the cloud. You\u2019ve already seen the uplift in new product innovation coming from our differentiated data in the cloud. So that\u2019s going to continue. And businesses like USIS that have been constructed by their cloud migration efforts over the last year and change as they complete the cloud, we would expect that to accelerate their new product rollouts going forward. So we have a lot of optimism of what it\u2019s going to do from a competitive standpoint as we complete the cloud. And as I said in my prepared comments earlier, the other big benefit is the ability for the team as we get towards the second half of the year and into 2025 to fully focus on just growing the business. Over the last almost four plus years, we\u2019ve been growing the business, operating the business, and doing this cloud transformation. It\u2019s a heavy, heavy lift. Getting that completed is a big, big milestone for the company. So we can really take advantage of all of our differentiated data in the cloud. Our increased focus on AI and ML, that\u2019s going to benefit us as we go into the second half and into 2025 and beyond. Operator : Thanks. The next question today is coming from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Your line is now live. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Hey, Mark, can you talk a little bit about the mortgage outperformance in USIS. There\u2019s obviously the FICO pricing increase, and then you mentioned the new Prequal product. Given the magnitude of the outperformance, could you kind of parse that a little bit for us? Is it like overwhelmingly FICO with some Prequal or how should we think about that in terms of the impact the new products having there? And then I have a follow up. Mark Begor : Yes. The pricing pass through is a very, very big piece of the mortgage outperformance. We haven't broken down to two, but the new solution, the pre-qual that's used in the shopping stage, is a meaningful piece and we're very pleased to have that on top of the price action, you should expect us to continue to bring new solutions to market, and this is an example of that as we go forward and as we look forward to 2025 and 2026 and beyond, we'll continue to focus on new solutions from our standpoint. And I think all of us will have to see what that pricing looks like as we get into 2025 from our FICO partner there and what they decide to do next year, as well as beyond 2025. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay, thank you. And then here, this is for John. Can you just go over the puts and takes on Workforce Solutions 2024 guidance going to 7% from 8% despite the fact that the mortgage market inquiries are expected to be better. Some of the stuff that were mentioned sounds like they would be more delays rather than permanent impacts. And I'm just hoping you can just parse that out a little bit more because that's kind of surprising to people, I'd say one of the most surprising in what we saw in kind of the earnings report. John Gamble : Sure. So, I think the full year is down a point, principally because of employer. Right. So that some of the items we talked about certainly was yes, it's a deferral, but it's lower for the year and it doesn't all turn in 2024. And ERC is lower for the year. And so generally speaking, the reduction is principally related to employer. On mortgage, we did indicate we're seeing slightly better performance than mortgage on inquiries. Right. That we said, we had expected shopping when we gave a guidance back in February to kind of to be not as substantial in 2024. What we saw in the first quarter is it was. So we're now assuming it will continue for the entire year. And that even though they're made, the inquiries are similar to; we're expecting a little weaker level of performance in terms of outperformance. Right. That we just talked about. So that's affecting mortgage revenue overall. Non -mortgage verifier revenue really strong, that continues to be very, very good. Government's performing incredibly well, outperforming our expectations overall. We expect talent to recover. We actually had fairly good performance in kind of the non-mortgage financial services portion of the P&L. So we felt relatively good about that. So overall, non-mortgage in verification services is very good. So the real movement relative to the 8% we gave before the biggest driver is employer services and then also mortgages, is even though maybe you have a little better overall inquiries in total for the year, they're being offset by the weaker level of outperformance that we talked about. Principally driven by mix. Right. Principally driven by customer mix, which we saw in the first quarter. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live. Faiza Alwy : Yes. Hi. Thank you. I wanted to ask about, the third party sales to credit bureaus that you mentioned that was weak and down double digits in the quarter. What exactly is that and what's driving it? And how should we think about this in the, for the rest of the year? Mark Begor : Yes, we sell our credit reports to a number of companies that provide credit monitoring to consumers in the U.S. We have our own business, and including the sell to [ph] Experian and TU to lots of others that provide credit monitoring. And we've seen some softness, particularly with the other two credit bureaus in the first quarter and actually late in the year. That's really what we referred to. And I don't know enough about what's driving that, whether they're cutting back on marketing or it's just a more competitive market. But that was an element that we just sold less credit reports that are passed through in credit monitoring solutions. John Gamble : Yes. We basically assume it's going to continue into the second quarter. Right. So we're seeing it to be at lower run rates. So we're assuming those run rates are just going to continue. Faiza Alwy : Okay. Understood. And then just to follow up on the question around EWS revenues. I know you said that you still expect, I think, government revenues to be up 15% for the year. Curious how we should think about the second quarter, sort of where we are in terms of redeterminations. So basically what's left in 2Q and then if you could also just comment on, I know you're talking about a recovery in talent. But give us a sense of how we should think about talent revenues for the year. Mark Begor : Yes. So I think that the number you're quoting for government we talked about back in February, and what we're seeing is government is outperforming that. So we feel very good about our government revenue very strong in the first quarter. Yes, redeterminations are technically completed by the end of March. So yes, that revenue should decline, but we're seeing really good performance across government strength in CMS, strength in other areas, strength within the states. Really good progress as we continue to do, to expand staff both through FDA and then also directly with the states. So we feel good about our ability to continue to grow government at a stronger pace than we had previously expected in talent. But we're indicating that we expected to get back to growth, right. I mean, we saw some weakness in January and February, nice recovery in March. We're expecting that to continue. We're going to get back to growth as we go through the year. And as I just mentioned, we do feel relatively good about what we're seeing overall in our non-mortgage financing structure, so that we feel relatively good there as well. So overall, non-mortgage and verification services looks like it's performing very, very nicely. And again, just like with mortgage, as we move through the year, the substantial growth in records, the tremendous growth that we're seeing in adding new payroll processors now large and small, is going to add to the strength in all three of those areas that I just talked about. Right. Government directly, talent also, because it not only adds hit rates, it also deepens the historical file that we're able to deliver to our customers. So it makes our product even more valuable. And then obviously also in non-mortgage financing. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Andrew Nicholas from William Blair. Your line is now live. Andrew Nicholas : Hi good morning. I wanted to ask about the FHFA's kind of latest timeline for its credit score requirements. I think they put that out at the end of February. Just wondering how you think about kind of now with that out there, the timing of the impact to your business and if a couple months later or even a couple quarters later since I think you last spoke on it, what your expectations are in terms of the impact to Equifax broadly? Mark Begor : Sure. I think the latest on that, this pushed out to late this year or early next year. It's still in a comment period. There's a lot of inputs coming in that don't support the 3B to 2B, from what we understand is including congressional inputs on that. There's also, what's on the table is to add a VantageScore in addition to the FICO score with regards to our view of timing, we don't expect anything to happen in 2024. And that's not in our guidance; it's not in our framework. And everything we see and hear that's going to be in 2025, if at all. Andrew Nicholas : Got it. Thank you. And then just for my second question, I wanted to go to Slide 14, I know this isn't a new slide, and you've talked about the 2015 to 2019 inquiry level relative to where we are today. I'm just wondering if there's any additional color you can give to that average inquiry level from 2015 to 2019 as it relates to kind of a mix between refi and purchase. And I ask because obviously it would seem like refinance after the wave of refinancing in 2020 and 2021 would be potentially subdued for a longer period of time than 2024, 2025, 2026 if we don't get back to those kind of interest rates. So is there any other context you can, could provide with that number? I guess, more succinctly, how much of that 2015, 2019 inquiry level is purchase versus refi? Thank you. Mark Begor : Yes. So if you look at originations during that time period. Right. Because obviously that in historical periods that details available, it was like average $7.5 million a year. And it was something like, something under 60% would have been purchase and something over 40% on average would have been refi. That was kind of the mix that you saw during that period, on average. Andrew Nicholas : That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Surinder Thind from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Surinder Thind : Thank you. Just a bigger picture question here. You talked about elevated activity in terms of rate shopping. Is that universal across, like cards, auto, mortgage, and then how much of an incremental benefit is it at this point in the cycle relative to maybe historical? So just some color would be helpful to understand as we think about longer term trends here. Mark Begor : Yes. The place we've seen that is really in mortgage. I suspect there's some level in auto, but it's probably harder to see. And as you know, the phenomenon that changed if you go back five years ago, is just digital consumers. Five years ago, there was more face-to-face activity around a lot of big ticket transactions like a mortgage, and now it\u2019s virtually all digital. So it\u2019s easy for a consumer to shop around. So we have seen the increase in the shopping behavior as we went into COVID. That still continued. We believe that that\u2019s just an element that will continue going forward that consumers have the ability to easily look at alternatives kind of digitally. And I think that\u2019s going to be an underlying element of the mortgage market going forward, which maybe to your question, if you look back to 2015 to 2019 [ph], there were some elements of shopping in there, but it\u2019s clearly increased. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to decrease as rates go down in a meaningful way. And rates aren\u2019t going down to where they were before, right? During the COVID time frame, it\u2019s hard to imagine that rates are going to go that low. So let\u2019s say rates go from seven towards six then towards five and maybe they end up at four or something, that\u2019s still a significantly higher rate from what people perhaps were used to during the COVID time frame when rates were so low, there will be an element of shopping going forward. Surinder Thind : That\u2019s helpful. And then it sounded like marketing spend, I realize this is not a large part of your business, but just conceptually seems to be down a little bit more than you were anticipating relative to last quarter. Any color you can provide there? And should that be concerning in the sense that if marketing spend is down that potentially is a negative for volumes down the road? Mark Begor : Yes. I would say that was de minimis. The change \u2013 the way we think about it on a sequential basis, again, we \u2013 our customers are still kind of operating what I would call normally. So there\u2019s that \u2013 like they\u2019re not pulling back because they\u2019re worried about the economy or the consumer. And that\u2019s where you would see marketing or prescreens or digital marketing to consumers around financial products, which is where most of our businesses cut back. We just haven't seen it. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Kelsey Zhu from Autonomous Research. Your line is now live. Kelsey Zhu : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. On mortgage Verifier, Fannie announced last month that lenders will now be able to use a single 12-month as that report to validate income, employment and assets, only one stack utilizing bank data. So just curious to get your view on whether this will have any impact on mortgage Verifier volume? Mark Begor : We don\u2019t think so. And we haven\u2019t seen it. There has been \u2013 there\u2019s various alternatives that can be used in a mortgage process. They generally have more friction, and they typically have less data. And the mortgage originators are \u2013 work hard to make sure that they\u2019re getting the full picture of the consumer. And then the other element is the instant nature of our data. So we haven\u2019t seen a change there, and we don\u2019t expect one going forward. We saw a very wide utilization of our TWN income and employment data in the mortgage vertical, and we expect that to continue. And then as we add records, we\u2019re already getting the inquiries from our customers, we\u2019re going to have higher hit rates as we continue to grow our records. Kelsey Zhu : Got it. Thanks. And my second question is still in EWS. I was wondering if you can remind us when renewals are coming up for most of your exclusive contracts with payroll providers? Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, I was under the impression that a lot of these contracts had a three- to five-year term, and they were mostly signed around 2021. So I was just wondering if that means they\u2019re up on renewals this year or next year? Mark Begor : Yes. We\u2019ve never talked about the term of any of our contracts with our partners. Those are confidential for obvious reasons. We have said, and it\u2019s the way they\u2019re structured, they\u2019re generally structured with auto renewals and they auto renew. And those are happening as we speak. There\u2019s none that are like \u2013 there\u2019s not like a cliff of these coming. If you remember our dialogues over the last one year, two years, three years, four years, five years, we\u2019re adding partnerships every quarter. As you add those, those have a term to them, but they\u2019re on auto renewal, and we deliver so much value to that partner. And the \u2013 not only from the integration, which is very complex. It\u2019s not a simple integration. As you heard earlier, we signed a large partner in the quarter that\u2019s going to add those 6 million records, it\u2019s going to take us two, three, four months of very intense technology and data work in order to bring those records into our environment so then they can be normalized to be delivered in our TWN report. So there\u2019s a lot of work that goes into that integration that makes our relationships quite sticky. And then, of course, from a monetization standpoint, as we keep growing our business, our partners\u2019 monetization grows every quarter. So there\u2019s a very strong relationship there. And as you may know, beyond just income employment with partners like payroll processors, we\u2019re increasingly doing our other services like I-9 unemployment claims and WOTC in partnership with those kind of companies. So we have multiple relationships. So maybe said differently, we\u2019ve got a lot of confidence in the long-term nature of our partnerships around TWN records. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jeff Meuler from Baird. Your line is now live. Jeff Meuler : Yes, thank you. You addressed the customer mix headwinds in TWN mortgage, but I think you also said there were some product headwinds, and it wasn\u2019t clear to me. Is that just lapping kind of the Mortgage 36 adoption and losing that tailwind? Or is there some trade-down effect if you can? Mark Begor : Yes, you got it, Jeff. That\u2019s the Mortgage 36. We\u2019ve got for the second half some other innovation coming out of mortgage in EWS that we would hope will benefit the second half or certainly in 2025. So we\u2019re always focusing on kind of new solutions that will add value. But Mortgage 36 was just a very powerful solution. And as you point out, we are lapping past that. Jeff Meuler : Okay. And then can you just comment to kind of share dynamics on the nonexclusive records for TWN mortgage? And just remind us how you monitor that? Thank you. Mark Begor : Yes. So just as a reminder for everybody that\u2019s still on the call, half of our records come from individual relationships through our employer vertical where we have delivered those regulatory services like UC I-9 unemployment, et cetera. So we or you, I say you tend to talk about our partner records, but a reminder that half of our records are individual relationships. And we\u2019re growing those every month as we grow our employer business. And as you point out, we\u2019ve got partnerships. And we tend to talk or you tend to talk about payroll processors, but they\u2019re HR software companies. Software platforms is another way for us to partner. We\u2019ve got a number of relationships there and a pipeline of additional relationships. We have pension administrators is another one, which is like a payroll processor but for the pension space. As you know, we\u2019re chasing that 20 million to 30 million of defined benefit pensioners is a big pool of data assets that we have. And those are all multiyear in nature, and we have strong relationships with all of those partners that we have. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners. Your line is now live. Craig Huber : Thank you. First question, in your U.S. Online Information Solutions area, can you size for us in dollars your credit card and your auto exposure there? And I\u2019m curious also what your outlook is again for revenues this year reach? John Gamble : Yes. So we haven\u2019t broken down all of the different markets that we have in USIS. FI and auto are two of our largest segments. So certainly the case, but we haven\u2019t specifically given dollar values within our online services for auto and card. But they\u2019re large within our total OIS revenue. Craig Huber : And how about the outlook there for the revenues for each of those auto and credit card for this year, please? John Gamble : I think what we did is we\u2019ve given a view specifically as it relates to total non-mortgage for USIS. And we talked about that in the call, both for the second quarter and for the year, right? And I think that\u2019s the level of granular we\u2019re going to talk about. We did indicate that we expect to see very nice performance in U.S. consumer, very nice continued growth above our long-term averages, right, with commercial, good performance also within ID and fraud right? Those we expect to continue to perform very, very well. We had very good performance in FI in the first quarter. We gave specifics on that as well. But in terms of specifics by segment, no, we don\u2019t give guidance at that level. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Simon Clinch from Redburn Partners. Your line is now live. Simon Clinch : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to just jump to the government vertical, please. And of the growth \u2013 the excellent growth that you delivered this quarter, are you able to break out how much of that growth actually came from redetermination so that we can get a sense of what the actual underlying growth rate is, to start with? Mark Begor : Yeah. And thanks for bringing up government. It's the first time we've gotten a question on that this morning. And as you know, that business is really performing exceptionally well. And as we talked about in the quarter it's actually now our largest vertical inside of Workforce Solutions for the first quarter in Workforce Solutions history. So it's a very powerful business for us in that $5 billion TAM. We exited the year at roughly a $600 million annual run rate in that business, which obviously is well north of, slightly north of 10% of overall Equifax. So it's a vertical we like with lots of growth opportunities. There are \u2013 there's multiple levers I think John and I both talked about in our prepared comments in government. Redeterminations are a piece of that. I wouldn't think about that as like disproportionate from the other levers that we have inside of government. You may remember back in September we signed a big extension with CMS that was over a billion dollars that had a price increase in it. So that's rolling through. That's a five-year contract. You can make your own assumptions on the impact that had in the fourth quarter. And again, the first quarter is that price increase goes into effect and that has annual escalators post when we lap it in September of 2024. We signed a brand new contract in September with USDA for SNAP TANF benefits that's $190 million contract over five years. So that's rolling into the P&L and positive in both the fourth quarter and the first quarter. And then we've also tried to be pretty deliberate about sharing that the state penetration is also a very strong lever for growth. And we should probably think about how we can better articulate that for you. But as you probably know we have a lot of penetration opportunity primarily at the states. Government social services are delivered at the state level and we've put more and more resources at the state capitals to really drive usage of our solutions. And as a reminder a state is not an entity. Each agency within a state is really the entity that we work with, whether it's food stamps, rent support, child care support, healthcare benefits all the different social services or kind of different organizations and all types of states. So that's had a big positive for us. So it may be a bit long winded, but it's multifaceted. All of those levers and then price, right. Prices inherent in our contracts, we don't do one, one price increases in our government contracts. Those are all built in as multi-year contracts with escalators in them. But we have a lot of visibility as we enter the year when those price actions are going to lay into our P&L as we roll through the year. Simon Clinch : Okay. Just time for a couple. Mark Begor : Strong growth in the second quarter, right, so we're going to continue with strong growth in the second quarter despite the fact that the redetermination after the pause is over. Again, as a reminder, redeterminations happen continuously. It's a requirement of government programs that you redetermine that the participants are still eligible. The difference was they were on pause during the health emergency. Simon Clinch : Yeah. Okay, thanks. And as a follow-up question, I guess it's more of a high-level question here on the mortgage market and EWS's position within it. The industry is going to be going through an evolution over the next decade, becoming more automated, reducing costs, but also shrinking, hopefully the time it takes from origination to closing a mortgage. I'm wondering how does that impact your business in EWS in terms of the pricing power you have, but also the number of \u2013 the number of polls you might get per inquiry and all that kind of stuff. How is that factored into your long-term framework? Mark Begor : Yes. So first off, you hit all the right points and it's not new. It's been happening as we speak, and it's been happening over the last five plus years as more and more consumers are shopping for mortgages online. It's actually very rare that they go into a mortgage broker's office now. So that's been a huge change, and as you point out, the fact that they're not seeing the consumer results in the value of instant as well as digital data being more valuable. And then the second half of that is every vertical we'll focus on mortgage, but autos the same case cards, et cetera. They want to shorten the time between, call it inquiry or application or shopping through the closing. And mortgage is very precarious for a mortgage originator, because they're spending $3,000, $4,000, $5,000 of COGS on that closed loan. And the reason they need instant and accurate data is they need to make sure that they want to continue to invest in that application over what could be a 60, 90 day timeframe and a lot can change for the consumer around their credit. They could take on more credit and then no longer qualify for the loan. It can change about their employment. They could lose their job; change their job, et cetera. So that's why instant data is very valuable. So digitization and focus on shortening the time to complete a process plays to Equifax when we have instant data. In the case of mortgage on income and employment, and background screening for employment history in government, social services around income, those all play to us. And there's also an element of productivity, because if they're not using our solution, in the case of mortgage there's still a large number of mortgage originators that do all of their verifications manually. There's a lot of labor involved in that. As labor costs go up, you have the double benefit of both speed, actually triple speed, accuracy and productivity. So those macros play to us in mortgage and more broadly across Equifax. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Toni Kaplan : Thank you. I wanted to ask a question on the guidance. It implies a strong second half improvement in workforce. And you talked about a number of the drivers in this call, including lapping the ERC headwind. And you mentioned adding records, among others. I was hoping you could talk about the pipeline with regard to records, if that's a big driver and also just maybe directionally the importance of what starts to go a little bit better as we go through the year? Mark Begor : So records is certainly one that is important. We were pleased with our record additions. As you know, we added four partnerships in the fourth quarter. We added a bunch last year, but those four coming on in the first half of the year, and then landing this largest payroll processor with 6 million records, that's a lot of records to add. When you think about [indiscernible] million individuals that is a real positive to have that. And now we have visibility of where we expect that to come on. And as you know, the power in our business model is that when we add a new record or these 6 million records, we monetize them the next day because we're already getting inquiries from our customers for them. So that clearly records in the second half is a positive and ERC is kind of what it's going to be. The WOTC piece is a little \u2013 is a kind of a timing impact. As the government forms didn't get fully implemented in the first quarter. That's going to be a benefit from that small backlog as we go through the second half. What else would you add, John? John Gamble : I think talent moves back across ten, which we think is very beneficial. You asked upfront about the pipeline for new contributors. We think the pipeline is very strong. What we talked about is who we've closed. The pipeline is also strong and there's opportunities for strengthen as we go through the year. And we would expect that it would, right. So we feel very good about the pipeline of new contributors and it's growing as we continue to add more. Mark Begor : Toni, I shared this earlier, but you think about the 126 million individuals we have today in our data set for twin. There's 225 million out there, so we got 100 million to go, so there's a long runway for record growth and as John pointed out, we have a very active pipeline for second quarter, for third quarter, for fourth quarter. There's still a lot of momentum and enthusiasm for those that are not monetizing the records with equal crack to do so. John Gamble : And it has some exciting new products in EWS, some of which we've already talked about, which we think should drive growth again in the non-mortgage segments, generally in verifier. So again we feel very good about the trends that you should be seeing as we go through the year and that will deliver. Toni Kaplan : Yes. Great. And just as you think about the first four months of this year, basically when you think about what you've seen in terms of consumer demand or lender appetite, you mentioned strong employment persisting and that's obviously good from a consumer credit standpoint. But just any sort of changes or trajectory that you've seen, that either make you more constructive or this is something we're watching? John Gamble : So far what we've seen, I think in terms of the broader markets other than mortgage, right. Obviously mortgage we guided and now assuming a market that was consistent with run rates that we were seeing. As Mark said, I think expectations in the market were very different than that. And we've seen probably the market expectations move toward where we started, maybe not quite to where we were, but moved in that direction. Other than that, right. I think the only market we talk about where we've seen a little weakness is in auto, and we have seen that was a little weaker than we expected. Other than that, generally speaking, I think the markets don't look that different than when we started the year. FI looks fairly good. Right. So I think we feel fairly good and we think things are operating consistent, generally speaking with where we started the year. Right. The big impact on USIS non-mortgage that we \u2013 that we've already talked about is our sales to other bureaus. Right. And that, that was weaker than we thought, and we've now assumed that that'll continue. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Arthur Truslove from Citi. Your line is now live. Arthur Truslove : Thank you very much. Good morning, [indiscernible]. So I guess the main question from me was, you're obviously saying that mortgage origination volumes were down 22%. I guess if I look at data from elsewhere, whether it's Fannie Mae, new acquisitions or MBA forecasts, it looks like they think volumes might been up certainly in January and February and maybe in the first quarter and certainly not down very much. I guess my question is sort of, how do you explain that gap between what these people seem to be seeing and what you've seen in terms of those originations? Thank you. Mark Begor : Yes. So what we quote, right. Is our inquiry. So we quote actual inquiry data on the credit bureau. Right. And as a reminder, mortgage transactions require tri-bureau pole. So we and our peers see every transaction. Right. We know there's third parties that estimate originations. They don't know what they are. They're doing surveys and estimating a number, and we don't use that number or try to explain the difference between inquiries, which are actuals as of the day that we give them and what you're seeing from third party groups that are doing estimations. So when we're talking about mortgage inquiries in the first quarter and our estimation of mortgage inquiries for the year, it's based on actuals and what we can see transacting. Arthur Truslove : But just following up on that. So if obviously inquiries are earlier in the process than originations. So I was referring more to the origination side within the Workforce Solutions business. And I guess my question was essentially, are you losing share there, whether to manual activity or to other participants in the market? Because on the sort of origination side, it looks like the third-party data providers offset are forecasting significantly better trends than what you printed. So I guess I was trying to understand whether you\u2026 Mark Begor : Maybe a couple of things, is this the data I think you're looking at and we look at too, we found historically to be too optimistic. Mortgage originations we don't see and the industry don't see except on a six month lag. Right. That's how it's reported. It doesn't show up. And what you're looking at is surveys. These are surveys where MBA and others will go out to some of the participants and say, what do you think mortgage originations are going to be? And some of those were done probably back in February or March when the expectation was of Fed rate cuts, maybe in second quarter, which obviously doesn't feel like that's how the Fed's signaling today. So there's a lot of change in that. When we look back historically at actual originations, which again are on a six month lag compared to our inquiry activity, there's a strong alignment with it, so we don't see it differing. And what we've done for a decade is use our mortgage inquiries as a proxy for the market because that's what we see. And then trying to share with you how we're doing versus the market, which is our mortgage outperformance typically. And what it has been. Not typically, but it has been meaning how far do we grow above the market from price product in the case of EWS records or penetration into either USIS or TWN customers. John Gamble : And if you take a look at the TWN inquiries that we discussed, as well as compare them to credit, somewhat similar, and they tend to be moving directionally together. So that's something we look at closely to see how they're moving together. Because we know in one case credit, we see all the transactions because it's mandated, right. So when we think about looking at trends and trends in EWS, we try to compare them a little bit to USIS, so that we can, that's our best judge for how things are trending across both businesses. Arthur Truslove : Thank you. That's very helpful. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. George Tong : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Within your Workforce Solutions business, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing around customer price sensitivity and overall competition in the quarter and impact that these might have had on EWS growth? Mark Begor : Yes. Two different questions. The first one on so-called price sensitivity and I would say universally, nobody likes price, nobody likes a price increase. So from a sensitivity standpoint, there's always challenges in any of our verticals when we go out to take price up. But our customers understand the value of our data and the uniqueness of our data. So those are conversations that we work through, and we work hard to try to be balanced around what we do on price. And as you know, price is only one lever that we use at Equifax. Product is a big part of how we go to market. And product for us, you got to think about, is really bringing more ROI or value to our customer\u2019s penetration into our verticals. We have big white space and lots of verticals, particularly in Workforce Solutions, where we're converting from manual to our instant solution. And then, of course, price. Competition maybe is a different question, you know, we think we have a very strong market position. We don't feel an impact, from the one or two participants that have much smaller businesses, in income and employment. Frankly, we think about our biggest competitor in EWS and income and employment is manual verifications. That's really the white space. And when you see the TAM, we had a TAM chart for government this quarter, and then we had a TAM for the whole business in last quarter's deck. That white space between our revenue and the TAM is all manual verifications. And our focus is on delivering our digital solution and driving penetration in there. George Tong : Got it. That's helpful. And I wanted to go back to your medium term mortgage outlook at this point, what proportion of mortgages have rates below 5% based on what you see? And how much would rates need to fall for mortgage volumes to go back to pre-COVID levels? Mark Begor : That's a very hard question to answer. The second half in particular, first half I don't have at my fingertips. We have that. And you can reach out to Trevor or Sam, and they can help us. I think there's public data out there on that. You know, it's very available on the number of mortgages below 5%. When we think about a mortgage recovery, we think about it being multifaceted and actually mostly driven by purchase. The purchase activity has come down dramatically as what I would call as normal refis. And as you know, there's two types of refis that happen. There's rate refis when the rate decrease, which I think is your 5% point. But there's going to be some level of consumers when rates go down to 5% to 4%, whatever the rates go to, of rate refis. There's also a large number of cash out refis. There's something like $29 trillion or almost $30 trillion of untapped equity in consumers\u2019 homes. And there's typically a fairly steady amount of cash out refis that happened. Those have been pulled back. There's still some happening, but they've been pulled back meaningfully from what we would characterize as normal because of the rapid increase in rates. And then purchase is a very big part of the mortgage business, and that's the one that's been curtailed more. There's just not a lot of housing stocks for sale. Consumers are not putting, although it's starting to pick up, but consumers are holding off upgrading from that two bedroom condo to the three bedroom house, or going from a rental property into an owned home. We would expect as rates stabilize, which they really have in the last, outside of the increase of 20 bps in the last couple of weeks, that they've kind of stabilized at this higher level. But the combination of stabilization and then some level of reduction as the Fed takes rates down is, we think will be the stimulus for, activity moving forward over the medium term, pick your, you can call it long or medium term, but meaning 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027 we would expect inflation to get under control. We would expect the Fed to take rates down, likely not to where they were during the COVID timeframe, but back down to more historic normal levels in order to boost economic activity. And we think that's going to be a stimulus to start driving our mortgage revenue into that $1.1 billion of opportunity as we return to 2015 to 2019 levels. Operator : Thank you. We reached end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Trevor for any further closing comments. Trevor Burns : Yes. Thanks, everybody, for your time today. Do you have any follow-up questions you can reach out to me and Sam. We\u2019ll be around today and tomorrow to discuss. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Trevor Burns, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Trevor. Trevor Burns : Thanks, and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Trevor Burns. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the IR Calendar section of the News and Events tab at our Investor Relations website. During the call, we'll be making reference to certain materials that can also be found in the Presentations section of the News and Events tab at our IR website. These materials are labeled 2Q 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Also, we'll be making certain forward-looking statements, including third quarter and full year 2024 guidance, to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors that may impact our business are set forth in our filings with the SEC, including our 2023 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. We will also be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and can be found in the Financial Results section of the Financial Info tab at our IR website. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark. Mark Begor : Before I cover our strong second quarter results, I want to update you on the significant progress in our cloud transformation. Over the next several weeks, USIS will complete the migration on to the cloud data fabric of all customers and services for their consumer credit and telco and utilities exchanges, which is a huge milestone for Equifax. Along with the EWS Work Number Exchange, which we completed migrating to the Equifax Cloud over two years ago, we will have our three largest data exchanges in the new Equifax Cloud. As of the end of July, we expect over 80% of Equifax revenue will be in the Equifax Cloud, with about 90% of our revenue in the cloud by year-end. The cloud migrations have been a huge effort across Equifax over the four plus -- the past four-plus years. We expect to have a significant competitive advantage as we pivot from building to leveraging the cloud that will allow us to fully focus on growth, innovation, new products, and AI going forward. Completing the USIS cloud and expanding EFX.AI, along with continued expansion of our differentiated data assets, will accelerate innovation and new products at USIS that will drive our top and bottom line. We now have streamlined access to our proprietary data through the data fabric, which will accelerate new product development. We also expect to reduce product development times, resulting in faster time to market for our new solutions. USIS has already begun to see their New Product Vitality Index accelerate. USIS is deploying Equifax proprietary Explainable AI, along with Google Vertex AI across Ignite, our global analytics platform, and Interconnect, our global decisioning platform. For USIS, Vertex AI enables faster and more predictive model development on our Ignite platform. The USIS cloud will deliver always on stability and faster data transmission that will give Equifax a competitive advantage in today's digital market, driving share gains. We're also driving faster data ingestion and analytics with greater processing power with the new Equifax Cloud. And most importantly, completing the cloud is going to free up the USIS team to fully focus on growth and expanding innovation, new products, data sets and markets. With both USIS and EWS in the cloud, we'll also be able to begin development of new products that integrate TWN income and employment data with USIS credit data solutions for mortgage, auto, cards, and P loans that only Equifax can deliver. Completing the USIS consumer and telco and utility migrations to the Equifax Cloud allows us to start decommissioning legacy on-prem systems in the third quarter, supporting our goal of spending reductions in 2024 that will improve operating margins and lowering the capital intensity of our business. In the second quarter, we also made substantial progress on our international cloud transformation activities. Canada is expected to complete their consumer credit exchange customer migrations to data fabric next month. Europe continues to make significant progress with the goal of completing Spain's consumer credit exchange migration to the data fabric and decommissioning of their legacy systems by year-end, and the U.K. is on schedule to complete cloud migrations and decommissioning in the first-half of 2025. And in Latin America, we've completed the Argentina and Chile cloud migrations and expect to make substantial progress on several additional Latin American countries in the second-half of this year. It's energizing to be approaching the finish line of our cloud transformation. We're entering the next chapter of the new Equifax as we pivot from building the new Equifax Cloud to leveraging our new cloud capabilities to drive our top and bottom line. Now, turning to slide four, we had a strong second quarter, with reported revenue just over $1.43 billion, up 9% and just over the top end of our April guidance. Adjusted EBITDA margins at 32% were in line with our expectations, and adjusted EPS at $1.82 per share was well above the high end of our April guidance. Our global non-mortgage businesses, which represents about 80% of total Equifax revenue in the quarter, had strong 13% current constant currency revenue growth, which is above the top end of our 8% to 12% long-term growth framework. Non-mortgage organic constant currency revenue growth was at 9% in the quarter and also at the top end of our 7% to 10% organic revenue growth framework. This performance was driven by 20% non-mortgage growth in EWS Verifier, led by strong 30% growth in government and talent that was up over 13%. International delivered 28% constant dollar revenue growth and strong 12% organic growth, led by strong growth in Latin America and Europe. USIS non-mortgage revenue growth of 1% was in line with last quarter and somewhat weaker than our expectations. We expect to see accelerating growth in USIS non-mortgage revenue as we complete the US consumer cloud migration later this month. Total U.S. mortgage revenue was up 4% in the quarter. The growth in mortgage revenue was driven by USIS, where mortgage revenue was up a strong 27% and consistent with our expectations. The strong growth in USIS mortgage reflects the continued benefit from strong vendor pass-through pricing actions and performance in our new mortgage pre-qual products. EWS mortgage revenue was down just under 12% and also consistent with our expectations. Equifax also had another strong quarter of new product innovation with a Vitality Index of almost 13%, above our 10% frame for 2024 guidance and our long-term 10% vitality framework. The vitality was up 350 basis points sequentially from broad-based execution across all of our business units, and EWS was particularly strong with a 17% vitality. Turning to slide five, Workforce Solutions revenue was up 5% and well above our expectations. Non-mortgage verification services revenue delivered very strong 20% growth, up 500 basis points sequentially and well above our expectations. Government had another outstanding quarter, with very strong 30% revenue growth from continued growth in penetration in their big $5 billion TAM. Government revenue grew sequentially from strong growth in state revenues despite the substantial completion at the end of March of post-COVID CMS initial redeterminations. We expect continued strong government growth over the medium and long-term in Workforce Solutions. Talent solutions revenue was up a strong 13% in the quarter, up 17 percentage points sequentially and well above our expectations. Talent solutions volumes improved sequentially and we saw very strong growth in our insights incarceration data products in the talent vertical. Based on data through May, EWS talent solutions outperformed the BLS white-collar hiring markets by approximately 19 percentage points from new records, new products, and penetration into the vertical. EWS mortgage revenue was down just under 12% and in line with our April guidance. TWN inquires in the second quarter were down 18% and consistent with the down 19% we discussed with you in April. TWN inquiries continue to be weaker than USIS credit inquiries as buyers continue to have difficulty completing home purchases. EWS total mortgage revenue outperformed TWN inquiries by over 6%. We expect EWS mortgage revenue to benefit significantly in the third and fourth quarters from the significant growth in TWN records already delivered late in the second quarter and from planned additions in the third quarter and fourth quarter. EWS consumer lending revenue was up 8% from strong double-digit growth in P loans and debt management and high-single digit growth in auto. Employer services revenue was down 11%, principally from lower ERC revenue. Excluding ERC, revenue was lower than expected at down 2% due to lower WOTC revenue as we talked about in April, partially offset by positive ACA revenue growth. We expect employer revenue to return to growth in the fourth quarter. Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margins of 53% were up 170 basis points sequentially and continue to be very strong from non-mortgage verifier revenue growth and good cost execution, while we continue to invest in new products, expand in high-growth verticals like government and talent, and grow our TWN records. Before moving on to USIS, I want to acknowledge the significant contribution of Rudy Ploder made to EWS and Equifax over the last 20-years. Under Rudy's leadership, EWS revenue grew from about $900 million in 2019 to $2.3 billion last year and has positioned EWS for strong above market growth, leveraging the Equifax Cloud. We're super energized to have Chad Borton, who joined us in May, leading Workforce Solutions. Chad's broad financial service experience, proven executive leadership, customer focus, and regulatory depth will be a big asset for EWS as they continue to drive above market growth. Turning to slide six, we continue to see very strong revenue growth in our EWS government vertical with 30% growth in the quarter and above our expectations. On the left side of the slide, we provided some of the federal agencies we are supporting with EWS digital income employment and incarceration data that accelerate the time to delivery needed -- to deliver needed social service benefits to over 90 million Americans and help government agencies ensure program integrity, a win-win for all parties. And in the middle of the slide, you see the substantial progress our EWS government vertical has made in a short time frame, penetrating that $5 billion TAM with a three-year CAGR of over 50%. We expect EWS government to continue to make significant progress in the government vertical from additional sales resources to federal and individual state capital level, strong record growth; new product rollouts; leveraging our differentiated incarcerated data -- incarceration data; and system-to-system integrations enabled by our cloud-native technology that makes our solutions easier to consume. EWS continues to help federal, state, and local government agencies improve the consumer experience and their own operating efficiency from the application and authentication phases to redetermination and recovery processes. The strength of the EWS government vertical was again clear in the quarter and we expect strong future revenue growth in this business in '25 and beyond. Turning to slide seven, EWS had another strong quarter of new record additions, signing agreements with four new strategic partners that will contribute over 3 million records collectively to the TWN database. Our continued success in expanding partnerships is a testament to EWS\u2019 ability to deliver the highest levels of client service from technology, data security and accuracy, and operational excellence for our partners and their end customers. We expect these new partnerships to come online and begin generating revenue for Workforce Solutions in the fourth quarter. In the quarter, EWS added 8 million active records to the TWN database, ending the quarter with 180 million active records, up a strong 12% on 132 million unique individuals. Total records are now 695 million and were up 10% versus last year. At 132 million unique individuals, we have plenty of room to grow the TWN database towards the TAM of 225 million income-producing Americans. EWS is also making very good progress building a pipeline of pension and 1099 contributors, as well as with HR software companies in partnerships and they expect to close partnerships in the second-half of the year as we continue focus on expanding the TWN database. Turning to slide eight, USIS revenue was up 7%, solidly within our long-term revenue growth framework of 6% to 8%. USIS mortgage revenue grew 27% and was in line with our April guidance. Mortgage credit inquiries, while continuing to be down significantly year-over-year at down 13%, were largely in line with our April guidance. Despite the modest reduction in mortgage rates we've seen over the last several weeks, we have not seen an improvement in mortgage market inquiries, likely due to continued low new home inventory levels. Consistent with the first quarter, the strong pricing environment, along with the strength of our pre-qual products drove the very strong mortgage revenue growth and outperformance. At $143 million, mortgage revenue was about 30% of total USIS revenue in the quarter. Total non-mortgage revenue at up 1% was below our expectation of 2% growth. We saw strong growth in consumer solutions and financial marketing services, which were partially offset by a decline in USIS B2B online revenue. We believe growth in the second quarter was negatively impacted by the U.S. team's broad-based focus on completing customer cloud migrations, which likely dampened some of the new business activity we were expecting. USIS online B2B non-mortgage revenue was down about 4% and below our expectations. Consistent with trends from the first quarter, we saw a continuation of tight credit conditions, which impacted the auto market, as well as the broader FI vertical. Auto was also impacted by a software supplier system outage that we all read about. USIS saw double-digit declines in third-party bureau sales and a lesser extent low-single-digit declines in telco and auto. These declines were partially offset by growth in the broader FI market and in insurance. ID and fraud was also below our expectations, as was auto. Financial marketing services, our B2B offline business, was up 7%. Marketing revenue was up 4%, primarily due to growth in pre-screen marketing. Our pre-screen quarterly trends have been fairly consistent, with growth coming from large FIs and fintechs, offset by declines in mid-sized banks and credit unions. USIS is seeing growing demand for our suite of Ignite solutions, including Ignite for Prospecting. Fraud revenue was up a very strong 15% from new business wins. USIS consumer solutions D2C business had another very strong quarter, up 13% from strong double-digit growth in consumer direct channel and high-single digit growth in our indirect channel. We expect mid-single digit growth in our D2C business in the second-half of this year against strong comps from last year. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 33.2% in the quarter and below our expectations, reflecting its lower-than-expected revenue growth. In USIS, the significant efforts across the business to complete the cloud transformation clearly had an impact on USIS customer engagement and non-mortgage revenue growth in the first-half. As USIS consumer cloud migration is completed in the next few weeks, the USIS team will now be able to fully focus on customer engagement and growth and we expect USIS non-mortgage revenue to see improved growth in the second-half of this year and, of course, in '25 and beyond. Turning to slide nine, international revenue was up a very strong 28% in constant currency and up a strong 12% in organic constant currency in the quarter, excluding the impact of BVS and well above the 20% growth we guided to in April due to continued very strong growth in Latin America and Europe. Europe local currency revenue was up a very strong 12% in the quarter, with continued strong 6% growth in our credit and data businesses and from very strong 23% growth in our debt management business. Latin America local currency revenue was up 124%, principally due to the acquisition of Boa Vista, with very strong organic growth of 30%. Latin America organic revenue growth was driven by very strong double-digit growth in Argentina, Paraguay and Central America. Brazil revenue in the quarter on a reported basis was $41 million. We continue to make good progress on the Brazil integration. Equifax Interconnect solution was launched for small business and medium businesses in the second quarter in Brazil with full feature release to service larger clients in the second-half. The first apps of Ignite have also been launched. Identity and fraud solutions, including count and mitigator, are now available for Brazilian customers, and Brazil is driving accelerated negative data acquisition to add to their database. The team is making excellent progress on driving growth and integrating with Equifax. Canada delivered 6% growth in the quarter. As I previously mentioned, we expect Canada to complete their consumer credit exchange customer migrations to the new Equifax Cloud in the next few weeks. And similar to USIS, we are expecting to see accelerated new product rollouts and growth going forward from the Canadian team. In Asia Pacific, revenue was down about 2%, as expected, better than the down 10% in the first quarter. We expect Asia Pacific to return to revenue growth in the second-half. International adjusted EBITDA margins of 25.6% were above our expectations and up 130 basis points sequentially, given their strong revenue growth performance. Turning to slide 10, we continue to make very strong progress driving innovation, with over 30 new products launched in the quarter that delivered a 12.5% Vitality Index, which was up 350 basis points sequentially and was driven by broad-based performance across all of our business units. EWS had a strong second quarter with Vitality Index of 17%, up 700 basis points sequentially. And we expect EWS VI to remain strong in the second-half with new product introductions focused on incarceration data, mortgage pre-qual or shopping behavior and I-9 and onboarding solutions. USIS saw continued sequential improvement with a Vitality Index of 8%, up 100 basis points sequentially. We expect USIS to continue to show strong VI performance from cloud completion as they leverage our new cloud-native infrastructure for innovation and new products in identity and fraud, commercial, and our new mortgage pre-qual products. International also had strong 11% VI in the quarter, up 200 basis points sequentially. We expect strong Equifax double-digit VI in the second-half, leveraging our Equifax Cloud capabilities to drive new product rollouts with a full-year VI for Equifax of over 10%. EFX.AI is one of our key EFX2026 strategic priorities, enabled by our new Equifax Cloud. We're energized to have a new AI leader onboard who will drive our strategic vision and execution in Explainable EFX.AI. We are accelerating the pace at which we are developing new Equifax models and scores using AI and ML in areas such as identity and fraud and consumer loan affordability that drive performance and predictability of our solutions. In the second quarter, 89% of our new models and scores were built using AI and ML, which is up 400 basis points sequentially and ahead of our 2024 goal of 80% and last year's 70%. Before I turn it over to John, I wanted to provide a few comments on our full-year 2024 guidance. We're maintaining our 2024 guidance midpoint with revenue of $5.72 billion, up 8.6% and adjusted EPS of $7.35 a share, up 9.5%. This guidance implies a strong second-half for Equifax, with revenue at the midpoint of $2.9 billion, up over 9.5%, and adjusted EPS of $4.03 per share, up 13%. Consistent with our practice, this framework assumes mortgage market activity consistent with the levels we saw in June and early July, resulting in a estimated full-year USIS credit inquiries at down 11% and consistent with our April guidance. As you know, we're using current trends to forecast mortgage market activity and have not seen a strengthening in the mortgage market activity despite the recent modest decline in rates and have not reflected the impact of any Fed rate cuts in the second-half. Delivering this level of performance in the second-half against the U.S. mortgage market that continues at the levels we saw in the first-half, we believe, is very strong Equifax performance. It reflects constant dollar non-mortgage growth of about 10%, again led by very strong non-mortgage growth in our Workforce Solutions verification services businesses and with strong continued growth -- organic growth in international and improving non-mortgage growth in USIS despite the continuation of the tight credit markets we saw in the first quarter and second quarter in the U.S., leading to some weakening in the auto market and also impacting the broader FI market. While we expect a continued weak mortgage market, we expect to grow mortgage revenue by 18% in the second-half. Of course, we continue to expect significant future mortgage market improvements as rates come down and mortgage market activity returns to normal 2015 to '19 levels. As we've shared previously, we expect to flow the $1.1 billion mortgage revenue recovery through to EBITDA as mortgage market activity improves at our very high mortgage market gross margins. And we're continuing to deliver expanded EBITDA margin growth, principally in the fourth quarter as we complete the transformation of our US consumer businesses and our businesses in Canada, Spain, Chile, and Argentina. Now, I'd like to turn it over to John to provide more detail on our second quarter financial results and to provide our third quarter framework. Our third quarter guidance builds on our strong second quarter performance from new products, penetration, record growth, and pricing. John Gamble : Thanks, Mark. Turning to slide 11, consistent with our practice from the first-half of 2024 and the last several years, our guidance for credit inquiries is based on our current run rates over the last two weeks to four weeks, modified to reflect normal seasonal patterns. We have seen 30-year mortgage rates just under 7% for the last five weeks. However, we have not seen meaningful improvement in the run rate of either credit or TWN inquiries, although we continue to expect mortgage market activity to improve as rates come down in the future. Our guidance reflects mortgage credit inquiries to be down about 7% in 3Q24 and 11% in calendar year '24, which for the full-year is consistent with our April guidance. Our guidance reflects TWN inquiries in the third quarter to be down over 7%, and for the full year, down approaching 14%. Second-half TWN inquiries are down about consistent with the decline in credit inquiries, reflecting an expected normalization of the mortgage shopping we saw in the first-half of the year as interest rates remain stable or begin to decline. As a reminder, and as we discussed in April, we expect the level of U.S. mortgage revenue outperformance to moderate as we move through 2024, as we start to lap the growth in new mortgage pre-qual products. We expect 3Q USIS mortgage revenue outperformance to be over 30%, down from the 40% in the second quarter, with full-year USIS mortgage outperformance expected to be about 40%. We expect TWN revenue mortgage outperformance in the second-half to increase sequentially from the new records we boarded in the second quarter. Slide 12 provides the details of our 3Q \u201824 guidance. In 3Q \u201824, we expect total Equifax revenue to be between $1.425 billion and $1.445 billion, with revenue up about 9% at the midpoint. Non-mortgage constant currency revenue growth should be up about 10%. Mortgage revenue in the third quarter is expected to be up over 12%. Mortgage revenue will be just under 20% of total revenue. FX is negative to revenue about 2%. Business unit performance in the third quarter is expected to be as follows. Workforce Solutions revenue growth is expected to be up about 8%, with non-mortgage revenue up about 10%. Non-mortgage verifier revenue should again be very strong in the third quarter, with growth slightly under the 20% we saw in the second quarter, again, driven by government and talent solutions. EWS mortgage revenue should return to growth and be up slightly in the third quarter. Both verifier mortgage and non-mortgage revenue growth benefit from the strong growth in TWN records we are seeing throughout 2024. And employer services revenue is expected to decline over 15% in the quarter, principally due to declines in ERC. We expect employer services to return to revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2024. EWS adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be about 51.5%, down about 100 basis points sequentially, principally from product mix. USIS revenue is expected to be up about 8.5% year-to-year. Mortgage revenue should be up over 25%. Non-mortgage year-to-year revenue growth of over 2% should be up from the up 1% we saw this quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be up about 34%, up sequentially about 100 basis points as USIS begins decommissioning legacy consumer and telco and utility systems. International revenue is expected to be up about 18% in constant currency, which includes the benefit of the acquisition of BVS that was completed August of 2023. Revenue is expected to be up about 12% in organic constant currency. EBITDA margins are expected to be about 28%, reflecting revenue growth. Equifax 3Q \u201824 adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be under 33% at the midpoint of our guidance, with a sequential increase reflecting revenue growth and the early stages of decommissioning of legacy consumer and telco and utility assets. Adjusted EPS in 3Q \u201824 is expected to be $1.75 to $1.85 per share, up 2% versus 3Q \u201823 at the midpoint. As of the end of the second quarter, our leverage ratio was 3.0 times, with a goal by year-end 2024 of about 2.5 times. We believe this leverage is nicely within the levels required for our current BBB, Baa2 credit ratings. As we achieve these levels, we will have significant flexibility to begin to return cash to shareholders through dividend increases and share repurchases, as well as continue to do bolt-on acquisitions in 2025 and beyond. Slide 13 provides the specifics of our 2024 full-year guidance, which is overall unchanged from the full-year revenue and adjusted EPS guidance we provided in April and is centered at the midpoint. Constant currency revenue growth is expected to be about 10.5%, with organic constant currency revenue growth of 8.5% at the middle of our 7% to 10% long-term organic growth framework. Total mortgage revenue is expected to grow over 10%, despite the over 10% decline in the U.S. mortgage market. Non-mortgage constant dollar revenue should grow over 10%, with organic growth of about 8%, led by very strong non-mortgage growth in our Workforce Solutions verification services business, with continued strong organic growth in international and improving non-mortgage growth in USIS. This is within our long-term framework. FX is about 180 basis points negative to revenue. As Mark discussed earlier, we are maintaining the midpoint of adjusted EPS at $7.35 per share. EBITDA margins, however, are expected to be 32.6%, down from the over 33% we discussed earlier this year. As Mark discussed, we are making very good progress on cloud migrations. However, they are completing up to a quarter later than we had planned. As a result, our cloud cost savings are lower due to timing in 2024, which negatively impacts EBITDA. Partially offsetting this impact is lower depreciation. As these effects are timing of completion, they only impact 2024 and do not impact the cost savings we expect to achieve in 2025 and beyond. Full-year BU guidance is principally consistent with what was shared in April, with the exception of the impact on USIS and international EBITDA margins per my previous discussion. Workforce Solutions revenue growth is expected to be up about 7%, with non-mortgage revenue up about 10%. Non-mortgage verifier revenue should be up over 15%, driven by government and talent solutions. EWS mortgage revenue should be down 3% for the year. EWS margins are expected to be about 52%. USIS revenue is expected to be up 9% year-to-year. Mortgage revenue should be up over 25%. Non-mortgage year-to-year revenue growth of about 2% is expected to be up from the 1% we saw in the first-half of 2024. USIS EBITDA margin should be about 34%, down about 50 basis points from our April guidance. And international revenue is expected to be up over 15% in constant-currency, which includes the benefit of the acquisition of BVS. Revenue is expected to be up about 10% in organic constant currency. EBITDA margins are expected to approach 27.5%, down from 28% in our April guidance. Using the midpoint of our 3Q \u201824 and fiscal year '24 guidance for revenue and adjusted EPS, the implied 4Q \u201824 midpoint for revenue is $1.465 billion, up 10% year-to-year and $30 million sequentially. And for adjusted EPS is $2.23 per share, up over 20% year-to-year. The improvement in adjusted EPS in 4Q \u201824 sequentially from 3Q \u201824 is certainly substantial and requires strong execution. The drivers of this improvement are expected to be as follows. About half of the improvement is driven by the sequential revenue growth at our very high variable margins. Revenue mix also should drive improved margins as non-mortgage revenue grows strongly sequentially and mortgage revenue declines sequentially. Mortgage has much lower margins relative to non-mortgage, principally due to much higher royalties and purchased data file costs in mortgage. Cost and expense reductions drive about a quarter of the improvement. These cost reductions are principally due to completion of cloud migrations in North America and Europe, resulting in lower COGS and also lower development expense. In addition to the cost benefit from completion of cloud migrations, we continue to execute fixed cost and expense reductions, which will also benefit 4Q \u201824. Items below operating profit, principally taxes, represent on the order of 20% of the improvement. Capital expenditures for 2024 are expected to be about $485 million, which is a year-to-year reduction of about $100 million. This is up from our April guidance, reflecting the timing of completion of the migrations to the Equifax Cloud that I just referenced. In the first-half of 2024, CapEx was $256 million, down almost $50 million year-to-year. We expect capital expenditures in the second-half to decline further as the tech transformation activities I previously discussed complete. Turning to slide 14, and as we discussed in April, the U.S. mortgage market is on the order of 50% below its historic average inquiry levels. As the mortgage market recovers toward its historic norms, that represents over $1 billion of annual revenue opportunity for Equifax in 2025 and beyond, none of which is reflected in our current 2024 guidance. At our high mortgage margins, this over $1 billion of mortgage revenue would deliver on the order of $700 million of EBITDA and $4 per share that we would expect to move into our P&L. Now, I'd like to turn it back over to Mark. Mark Begor : Thanks, John. Wrapping up on slide 15, Equifax delivered another strong quarter with 11% constant currency revenue growth, which was at the upper end of our 8% to 12% long-term revenue growth framework, reflecting the power and breadth of the Equifax business model and strong execution against our EFX2026 strategic priorities. Our very strong 20% EWS non-mortgage verifier revenue growth, 12% EWS active record growth, and strong 12.5% broad-based VI give us momentum as we enter the second-half of 2024. A big priority for 2024 is to complete our North America cloud transformation, as well as significant portions of our global markets, which will enhance our competitiveness, drive margin expansion, reduce our capital intensity, expand our free cash flow for bolt-on M&A, dividend growth, and share repurchases. Completing the USIS consumer cloud migrations in the next few weeks is a significant milestone for Equifax. We continue to expect CapEx to decrease in 2024 by about $100 million to under 8.5% of revenue with further reductions in 2025, allowing us to move towards our long-term CapEx goal of 6% to 7% of revenue as we exit next year. Entering 2025 with 90% of Equifax revenue in the new Equifax Cloud is a big milestone, so the Equifax team can move towards fully focusing on growth. Another significant EFX2026 strategic priority is to drive innovation through our investments in EFX.AI. AI and machine learning are changing the way we develop new products in our single data fabric, the way we -- and allowing us to build higher performing models, scores, and products, ingest and cleanse data, and operate our consumer care centers more effectively. We're on offense at Equifax with EFX.AI. We're entering the next chapter of the new Equifax as we pivot from building the new Equifax Cloud to leveraging our new cloud capabilities to drive our top and bottom line. We're convinced that our new Equifax Cloud, differentiated data assets in our new single data fabric, leveraging EFX.AI and machine learning, and market-leading businesses will deliver higher revenue growth, expanded margins, and accelerated free cash flow that will enable us to start returning cash to shareholders in 2025 and beyond. We remain focused on executing our long-term model, delivering 8% to 12% revenue growth with 50-plus-basis points of margin expansion annually on average over a cycle. Before I turn the call over to the operator, I'd like to thank Sam McKinstry on the Investor Relations team for his significant contributions over the past four years. Good news, Sam's staying with Equifax and is taking a position within the USIS business to further his career in finance. He's been a real asset to the IR team and the investor community. And joining the Investor Relations team from Equifax is Molly Clegg, and we welcome Molly to the IR team. With that, operator, let me open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is now live. Manav Patnaik : Thank you. Good morning, and congratulations on getting close to this tech transformation ending. My first question was on that, which is, how much of the cost savings, I guess, have you baked into the third quarter, fourth quarter, and I guess, more importantly, just a run rate of what we should think this is now going to help in 2025 just on its own? John Gamble : Yes, I don't think we're going to get into 2025 guidance, but in terms of third quarter and fourth quarter, we've baked in the cost savings related to the North American consumer businesses completing transformation in the third quarter and beginning their decommissioning, and we've done the same thing with regard to Spain and some other movements we've talked about in Mark's script in the fourth quarter. So when I talk about... Mark Begor : The savings are really in the fourth quarter and then we'll get the annualization of that next year. John Gamble : Absolutely. As we talked about in the bridge from third quarter to fourth quarter, a significant portion of those savings, as Mark said, really gets in the fourth quarter, because the transformations and the completion of the transformations and beginning to be decommissionings don't start until later in the third quarter. Mark Begor : And Manav, I think, as you know -- I appreciate you pointing it out, this has been a long road. We started this five years ago and to be close to this finish line with 80% of our rev in the cloud in the next month or two and 90% in the fourth quarter, it's really a huge milestone. It's been a huge effort by the entire organization to run the company over the last number of years, but also do the cloud work. And we're super energized to really be pivoting to leveraging that cloud in the second-half as we complete USIS in Canada in the next couple of weeks and then really go into 2025 in a very, very strong position. Manav Patnaik : Okay, fine. And then just broadly, I think just from the first-half results, it looks like there's a lot of pluses and minuses across the segments. I was just curious in terms of the way you set the second-half guidance. Like, where would you say you've perhaps left some room for error or being conservative on it? Mark Begor : Yes. We try to be balanced. I think you know that. We want to put forecast out that we know how to meet and we feel a lot of confidence in the forecast we put out. I think John and I in our prepared comments talked about some of the positives we have. We've had some challenges, you always do in a business. I think we highlighted USIS has seen some softening in the first quarter in some of their end markets and also in the second quarter. Mortgage hasn't really come back, and short of rate cuts, we don't expect that to happen in our guide. We've seen some impacts likely from the big focus in the first-half in USIS and cloud transformation. We expect those to obviously mitigate so the commercial team can be fully focused on just commercial conversations versus also commercial and cloud. EWS is performing exceptionally well. You look at the government performance, talent had a very strong quarter. Obviously, we talked about employer impacted by WOTC and some other kind of macros that will solve themselves, but likely later in the year, that will benefit 2025. But putting that all together and -- maybe just finishing with international, strong momentum there and all the businesses performing above our expectations. When we put that all together, we felt like we had the right framework in holding the year in the second-half. Manav Patnaik : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Andrew Steinerman : Hi, there. First, I would just want to confirm that second quarter revenue percentage for mortgage was 20%, I know the word about was used? And then the second question is, I want to focus just more on the third quarter guide, and Mark, I know you really talked about the second-half there. And I want to focus specifically on USIS. I surely heard you highlighting that the cloud migration, let's call it, multitasking will be behind us the end of this month for USIS, so revenue acceleration there into August? And then I also heard the comment about CDK, which was a drag to auto revenues and auto dealers in the second quarter. That also seems behind us. So, what other kind of maybe drags have you assumed on USIS in the third quarter guide? Because the third quarter revenue guide for USIS, to me, looks a little conservative. And did you change any assumptions about the health of the U.S. consumer outside of mortgage when thinking about that third quarter USIS guide? John Gamble : Andrew, to your specific question, it's -- 21% was the exact number. Andrew Steinerman : Thank you. Mark Begor : And to your question on USIS, I think we -- in our prepared comments, Andrew, I know you heard them. We've seen some softening in some of the end markets in USIS late in the first quarter, certainly continued in the second quarter. You talked about the CDK impact obviously, you know, was a negative late in the second quarter. That's obviously behind us. But the end market softening, for example, in auto, while mortgages have been impacted by higher rates, we're seeing some impact in auto where the payments for new and used cars are very high with the higher rates that are being charged. And we've seen some impact in just consumer demand for loans in auto. And then a broader, I would call it slight softening in second quarter. And we carried that forward in the second-half. So that's reflected in the USIS guide. I don't know if you'd add anything else John? John Gamble : No, Mark's already talked quite a bit about the distraction from transformation that does recover in the third quarter. We start to come out of that right, but again we're just finishing transformation in the quarter. So you're not going to see a lot of benefit in the third quarter. You don't start to see that till fourth quarter and really next year. You are starting to see NPI improvements in USIS. But again, those are not going to really accelerate until you get to the fourth quarter and next year. Andrew Steinerman : Makes sense. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Heather Balsky : Hi, thank you for taking my question. I wanted to start off with EWS verification -- or verification in EWS broadly into the back half and thinking about the sequential trend from 3Q and what's implied into the fourth quarter. Especially for 4Q, there seems to be some implied material acceleration. And recognizing that the mortgage market has somewhat stabilized and the benefits from that, can you just walk us through the building blocks to kind of what gets you to the trends in 3Q and what's implied for 4Q and where you're seeing the biggest tailwinds? John Gamble : Yes. So just as an overarching statement, right? It's important to remember that EWS verifier is benefiting in the second-half, really significantly related to record additions, right? They've done an outstanding job with adding new partners. We had a significant partner come online very late in the quarter. And we -- as Mark said, we added four more. We added a substantial number in the first-half. Those records are coming online, and that drives a substantial amount of revenue in the second-half. Mark Begor : And maybe adding to the records point, John, is that we have real visibility as we are in July now and in the third quarter and as we look out to the fourth quarter of meaningful record additions that we're working on, and we haven't closed those yet, so we haven't added them into our discussions with you. But -- and as you know, records, when we add them, when they come online, they turn into revenue that day, because we're already getting the inquiries. That's the beauty of the of the system we have. Sorry, John. Go ahead. John Gamble : No problem. And as you get into fourth quarter, obviously, what you're seeing from third quarter to fourth quarter is there's some traditional strength generally from third quarter to fourth quarter in talent, right? Just because of seasonal hiring in I-9, because of seasonal hiring where we do onboarding for companies. We generally see some strength in banking and card, around CLIs. And then importantly, in CMS, ACA sign-ups start in the fourth quarter. So we generally see nice growth in government going into the fourth quarter. And then you layer on top of that the strength in records, and that's what gives us confidence that we're going to see good performance as we go through the back half of the year in verifier non-mortgage. Mortgage, we've talked about, I think that's been covered. And employer, what we're seeing is, as we get into the fourth quarter, the significant impact of ERC that we saw through the first nine months of the year, we wrap around the decline that occurred in the fourth quarter of last year. So employer revenue on a year-over-year basis, the growth rate will be substantially better. As we said, we expect to be flat to slightly up relative to the declines that we've been seeing, and that's principally driven by the fact that we saw a big decline in ERC in the fourth quarter of '23. So, I'd say that's why we feel good about the way EWS is trending and the opportunities to drive the revenue growth we're talking about. Heather Balsky : Got it. Thank you. And I know you've gotten questions about where there might be a little bit of caution in the guidance and room for upside. There's been a couple of surprises the past few quarters, the WOTC, the transition taking a little bit longer. Do you feel like for the back half, you've given yourself some room for some things that might occur like that, some of the stuff that may be kind of out of your control? Mark Begor : Yes, we're always trying to do that, as you know, and it's often not easy. Like, the WOTC change that took -- went in place last year, we just thought would be implemented by the states more quickly. Government bureaucracies sometimes move at different paces. But we think we have good visibility. We talked earlier about the records. That's one where we have high visibility on. We know who we've signed, we know when they're coming on. We have kind of those schedules. So that gives you a lot of visibility. We -- do what you would suggest or would think we do is, we handicap different macro elements and try to put our best forecast together. And I think, as you know, on mortgage, while there's maybe increased talk about a rate cut in September, we don't have that in our forecast. We wouldn't put it in our forecast. That's not our process. If that happens, that's going to be good news for the second-half. But outside of our forecast and -- as you know, we expect rates over the medium term, call it, into '25 and '26 to come down, and that's going to be a real tailwind for us on the mortgage side. So yes, we've put pluses and minuses that we think we know about into the forecast, and that's why we put it in front of you. John Gamble : And as Mark referenced and we talked about in the script, right, I mean, obviously, we know third quarter to fourth quarter requires a lot of execution. But we have a lot of confidence in the way the teams are executing right now and it's around completing the transformations. We think we have very good visibility into how that's going to complete and the timing. Heather Balsky : Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Kelsey Zhu from Autonomous Research. Your line is now live. Kelsey Zhu : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question is on talent. Obviously, we've seen really strong growth this quarter. I was wondering if you can tell us a little bit more about the new products you've introduced year-to-date, how much they have contributed to growth, as well as kind of upcoming product pipeline and how you expect them to contribute to growth. Mark Begor : Yes. And in talent, you have to add to it also the penetration. Remember, that's a large TAM that we have a big position in, but there's a lot of runway for growth of just converting manual -- let's use just employment verification processes. As you know, we have incarceration, we have education data and other data elements, like medical credentialing data. But just the penetration is just a huge opportunity just like government. The -- when you've got a $450 million, $500 million kind of run rate business in talent, operating in a $3 billion-plus TAM, there's just a lot of penetration opportunity. Product is a big lever also. We've got a lot of focus around new products on incarceration, on education, on different depths of employment data. We rolled out an hourly solution for hourly background screens that don't require as much employment history. So, there's a big focus there. And I know the team is working on the next chapter of combining those data elements with our goal being to have a single transaction to deliver all the data that's required for a background screen, which would include employment history, would include incarceration, education, et cetera. We signed and announced a new partnership on education that goes beyond college degrees and into high school and vocational schools. So, that's another depth of element that's a part of our second-half focus on talent. John Gamble : And in the second quarter, we saw very nice growth out of the insights portfolio -- incarceration, as Mark referenced, helping us drive the talent growth rate. So that was a nice growth area for us in the second quarter. Kelsey Zhu : Got it. Super helpful. And then my second question is on government. We also saw really strong growth this quarter. How much of that is driven by the CMS contract extension? And are there any one-off factors that contributed to growth this quarter? And how should we think about a sustainable growth rate going forward? Mark Begor : Yes, that's a heavy question. Let me take a few parts of that. When you think about government, I think, John and I both mentioned in our comments, the biggest driver in government is penetration into that big $5 billion TAM. That's really at the state agency level. And as you know, we've continued to add resources in our government team in -- at the states in order to drive that penetration. And remember, you've got multiple agencies that are using our data, and in most cases, are not using our data, they're still doing it manually, whether it's for healthcare benefits, food support, rent support, childcare support, education support, income support, there's about a dozen different social services. And I think you know the scale of the U.S. consumer base that -- or household base that receives these services. It's about 90 million Americans receiving those services. And when you think about our business, call it, roughly $800 million run rate today against that $5 billion TAM, you've got over a $4 billion really manual processing of principally income verification that we're penetrating into. So, state penetration is a big driver and we think about that as very sustainable. There's not -- there's no one-offs in there. You get embedded in their workflows and then you become a part of that process. As you point out, we did expand -- extend our CMS contract last September. So, we're still taking the benefit of the price increase that was built in there. And as you know, that's a five-year contract with annual escalators. So that's one with a lot of visibility. So there's not any kind of one-offs in there. Anything else you'd add, John? In government -- you can tell we're quite energized. Government, last quarter and now again this quarter, is the largest vertical in Workforce Solutions and it's the business with, we think, the largest runway. Your question about the long-term growth rate, it's obviously outgrowing. In the last three years, it's had a 50% CAGR. It was up 30% in the quarter, I think 35% last quarter. So it's had very strong above kind of framework growth for Workforce Solutions, in the 13% to 15% total growth. We've been clear that we expect government to outgrow our 13% to 15% framework for EWS over the long-term. So that's clearly a business that we have a lot of confidence in and we're investing a lot in because of the opportunity there. We haven't given any guidance for '25. We'll do that as we get through this year, but we've been clear that we expect it to grow faster than the rest of Equifax and faster than the rest of EWS. John Gamble : Yes. And in terms of 2024, just looking at sequential trends, right, I think the sequential trends we're seeing in the second quarter were good and strong. And third quarter and fourth quarter, I think, are very consistent with what we've seen in the past. And specifically, the -- as we referenced, the growth we're expecting into the fourth quarter is heavily driven by CMS and the fact that ACA starts in the fourth quarter, and every year, we see a pop in revenue from that agreement with CMS, in 4Q and then again in 1Q. Kelsey Zhu : Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live. Faiza Alwy : [Technical Difficulty] Operator : Faiza, your line is now live. John Gamble : Faiza, we can't hear you. Mark Begor : Yes, we got you now, I think. Faiza Alwy : Oh, is this okay? Mark Begor : Yes. That's better, yes. Faiza Alwy : Okay. Okay. Sorry about that. So, wanted to ask about the USIS acceleration that you're expecting on the revenue line just from cloud completion. Talk a little bit about your confidence in that, maybe what type of new products [Technical Difficulty] talked about potential market share gains. So, just give us a bit more color and confidence around that acceleration. Mark Begor : Yeah. And as John said earlier in one of the questions, we expect to see some benefits perhaps later in the year, but that's really going to be in '25, '26, and '27. There's no question that there's been some distraction for that team. This has been our most complex cloud transformation of the 40-year-old kind of consumer credit -- we call it, ACRO platform that we had. To be finishing it in the next couple of weeks is just a huge accomplishment and it's just taken so much bandwidth from the team to complete that. So, kind of the focus of the team is one positive that we'll have in the second-half, but you should think about that really benefiting as we get into '25 and beyond. You point out a number of really important levers. We believe the always-on stability, the ability to roll out new products more quickly just make us a more valuable partner to our customers. And we do expect to have share gains going forward. We've got some of those in flight and a lot of conversations going on. The feedback from our customers, that we've moved 99% of our customers to the cloud -- I think it's even higher than 99% as I speak today, has been outstanding. The performance, the speed, acceleration of moving the data, just the feedback is super positive. And as you know, that's one of the reasons we invested this substantial amount of money in the cloud four-plus-years ago was we believed it was going to give us a stronger competitive position with our customers. So you -- and we should start to see those benefits really in '25, but the momentum -- there should be some good guys as we get into the second-half on that. New products is another big deal. As you know, their vitality has been below our 10% goal for a number of years as they've been working on the cloud transformation. We've seen some positive acceleration in the quarter. I think there were 8% vitality and up 100 bps, which is positive. So, the team is starting to create some bandwidth for new products. And you'll see new products, really, from every element of USIS, a lot of stuff coming out from identity and compliance, which we're excited about, a lot of risk-based solutions, data combination solutions, given we have such really unique data in USIS versus our competitors, particularly in the alternative data with NC+, DataX, and Teletrack. So, a lot of traction there. Some products in marketing, leveraging our IXI wealth data have been coming out. And then the last one I'd comment on is -- I used it in my comments -- I mentioned in my comments is, with the cloud complete in EWS and now the cloud complete in USIS, we've got a big focus on delivering products that really combine TWN, our income and employment data, with the credit file. We think there's a lot of opportunities to put a flag on the credit file, for example, in mortgage, auto, P loans, so when one of our customers is pulling a credit file, they'll know that there is a individual there that's also working. That adds to the underwriting capabilities of that consumer and adds to the value of our credit file and our solution. And we're really energized about those kind of solutions that combine USIS and EWS products that will benefit both businesses, but we think make our credit file more valuable, which should drive credit file share. So that's a second-half focus on the product side, likely a 2025 implementation. So we're really energized around the always-on stability that will drive our competitive advantage, and then as you point out, the ability to roll out more new products, leveraging the USIS data, but then also bridging between USIS and EWS going forward. John Gamble : The only thing I'd add is, we're also seeing nice growth in the use of Ignite in pre-screening and Ignite by our customers. That's important, because that's also the platform in which we're deploying our proprietary and then also Vertex AI. So we're making that available to our customers, and it allows us to expand and -- expand the use that we have substantially. So we feel very, very good about the fact that we're seeing accelerating adoption of Ignite in the marketplace with our customers using it directly and with us developing products internally. Faiza Alwy : Great. Thank you so much. And then my second question is on EWS mortgage side. Obviously, we've had a lot of conversations over the last few quarters, even years about TWN inquiries versus outperformance. So, just give us the lay of the land in terms of how you're thinking about outperformance from here. And then I know you talked about TWN inquiries sort of stabilizing maybe or being more in line with the credit inquiries. And I'm sure you saw the HMDA data came out last week. I'm just curious if you reflected on that, and any incremental thoughts around just EWS mortgage? John Gamble : Just in terms of how we expect EWS mortgage to perform relative to inquiries, right, as we talked about, a lot of our improvement in the second-half is driven again by records, right? So, Mark talked a lot about the fact that we've done a really nice job of adding new partners, and we're adding a significant number of records, a lot of them boarded late in the second quarter. So we are expecting to see revenue benefits in EWS from record additions, from the records that were added at the end of the second quarter and also the record we're going to add throughout the rest of this year. And that's really the big driver. Mark Begor : Yes, I'll just add again. I mentioned it earlier -- in one of the earlier comments. I think you know this, but record additions, we already have the inquiries coming. When we add the records, they turn into revenue. So it's such a powerful lever for us. And as you know, we've had really strong momentum there on records and we've signaled we have strong momentum in the second-half, and also good visibility. We don't have to do anything else, but get the records in our data set and they become revenue, because we already had the inquiries coming in from our customers. We just have higher hit rates. John Gamble : Yes. We're also looking -- we're also expecting some benefits from new products. I think we've mentioned that in the past, some marketing products that we're trying to put in place earlier in the approval funnel. So, we're going to continue to work on NPI in EWS mortgage, but the big driver certainly in the second-half of 2024 is driven by the strong performance and records in the first-half of 2024, as well as what we expect to continue to do in the rest of this year. Faiza Alwy : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Surinder Thind from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Surinder Thind : Thank you. I'd like to start with a question just about the innovation cycle. When we think about all of the commentary that you've kind of provided, is the idea that we should be entering a period, especially within USIS, of accelerated innovation? And how quickly will those products come out? And then should we expect, what I would call, well above normal in the near term or -- help us work us through that cycle, I guess? Mark Begor : Yes, it's a great question. As I commented on the last question, they've clearly been dampened with all the focus on completing the cloud. We were really energized with the momentum that they even had in the second quarter in the midst of a very heavy quarter of cloud migrations that their vitality was up 100 bps to 8%. They've been below our 10% goal for five years or six years, pick the time frame, when we increased that goal from 5% to 7% to 10% for Equifax. And we expect USIS to move to that 10% as we get into '25 and the latter part of '25, meaning they've got really good momentum there. I rattled off a whole bunch of solutions that they're working on and that they expect to roll out in the second-half. These new products take time and they were clearly hampered by the cloud transformation, and we expect that with the cloud completion in the next couple of weeks to see some increased focus. And then as I mentioned on the other -- the last question, we're also -- have a big focus. We actually have a dedicated leader and team working on the EWS, USIS products, meaning the product combinations, which we've never done before, and we think will be quite powerful and kind of only Equifax solutions that we can bring to market. We've got a dedicated team in USIS and they're going to be really putting the pedal to the metal as we finish the year. To your question about when you'll see a lot of the benefit, I think that acceleration will happen in 2025 versus the second-half, but you're going to see a positive momentum of products coming out. They may not be revenue in the fourth quarter, but they'll turn into revenue in '25 and beyond. Surinder Thind : Thank you. And on the implied 4Q margins, it sounds like there is a tax benefit in there as well. If we adjust that out, is that the right run rate for the firm on a go-forward basis from beyond 4Q? John Gamble : Yes. So, in terms of 2025 EBITDA margins, we'll give you guidance on that as we get into 2025. But as we've been talking about, and Mark talked about the fact that we expect, on a long-term model, 50 basis points of improvement per year. And we do expect to see nice improvement in margins as we get into 2025. In terms of an exact level, we'll talk more about that as we get into next year. Mark Begor : And maybe I'd just add, John. I think we're all watching to see when the Fed's going to change rates, and we believe the positive impact that'll have on mortgage activity, we've been very clear that as that starts rolling in, that's going to be accretive to our margins in a very positive way, meaning it's going to drop through in very high incremental EBITDA levels, 70-plus, when that happens in -- likely in '25 and beyond as rates move down to some more normal level. Surinder Thind : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Andrew Nicholas from William Blair. Your line is now live. Andrew Nicholas : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. A lot of talk about record count. Obviously, a really strong number, both year-over-year and sequentially. I just kind of wanted to ask about the Gig/1099 and pension opportunity there. And more specifically, how chunky or how big can those kind of record adds be on a one-by-one basis? And part of why I ask is I'm just trying to figure out if it's maybe more expensive from like a sales staffing perspective to acquire those deals, or if they can be comparable to some of the HR technology, software and payroll relationships that you've fostered over the years. Mark Begor : Yes, it's a whole range, as you might imagine. Use pension -- there are pension administrators that manage to find benefit pension payments, almost like a payroll processor for companies. We've signed one or two of those kind of relationships. So you think about those like a payroll processor. Those can be, call it, more chunky, meaning larger. We have direct kind of relationships around pension records and just a long runway in pension. And then there's a lot of pension records, as you might imagine, in federal, state and local government organizations, fire departments, police departments, government agencies, still have defined benefit pensions, most corporations do not, like the vast majority, but some of the legacy corporations still have that. So that's how we're going after pension, we have a dedicated group -- first off, we have a dedicated leader that works for -- our EWS leader that all they work on is records. And you may remember that's a change we made in December, to put a full-time dedicated leader. At the time, he had other tasks in EWS, and we just saw an opportunity to really continue to drive records. So, we asked him to fully focus on records. So, there's a dedicated team on pension and we have a dedicated team on 1099. We have a dedicated team on, call it, W2 or non-farm payroll partnerships, which would be payroll processors, HR software companies and others like that. And then also, remember that half of our records come from our direct relationships that we get through our employer business. So that's another important focus of ours, is we're continuing to invest in new products and capabilities to have those direct record relationships. On 1099, kind of we have a dedicated team. It's a different path that's going to some of the big Gig operators. But remember, 1099, income-producing Americans include doctors, dentists, lawyers that are self-employed and very high income. So you've got to go to like tax prep services that do their quarterly estimated taxes as a way to get some indication of their income. So, lots of different avenues that, I would say your question about, are some chunky and some more granular, the answer is, yes, it's a mix of all of the above across really all three kind of areas for focus on records. The positive we have is our scale, so we can focus on really going after those in so many different places. And we've got a big focus on it for the obvious reason because of the benefit we get. We're already receiving the inquiries. So, as we add records, we're able to translate those into revenue and give higher hit rates for our customers, which is what they're after. Andrew Nicholas : Very helpful. Thank you. And then for a very quick follow-up for John, I believe. On the -- you've talked about the outperformance in mortgage for EWS. Maybe kind of underlying that, is the expectation that the EWS inquiry number more closely tracks kind of the overall mortgage inquiry number in the back half, or is your expectation that that gap persists as, I guess, mortgage lenders and buyers don't get all the way through to the final stages of the purchase process? John Gamble : Now, in the second-half, we've assumed it narrows and that they tend to trend -- they're going to trend together. Now, again, that's based on our expectation. It's also based on the trends we're seeing today, right? So, as we just run out the trends for the rest of the year and apply seasonality, separately, it looks like the movement in USIS credit inquiries and in TWN inquiries, should move on a percentage basis year-on-year similarly, right? So we'll have to see, right? I mean, we have been surprised in the past, where sometimes the shopping behavior continues longer than we expect. But right now, it looks like it's starting to narrow and we can also see it analytically. Andrew Nicholas : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Jeff Meuler from Baird. Your line is now live. Jeff Meuler : Yes, thank you. Good morning. So, just when you had an Investor Day a few years ago, there was going to be kind of like an outsized margin expansion period after the cloud transition was complete. I just -- what's the current thinking on flowing through the tech transformation savings into margin versus any change in thinking on reinvesting that to, I guess, best harvest the increased revenue opportunity from the cloud transition? Mark Begor : Yes, no change, Jeff. We're going to flow that through. We're investing and we have been, and you've followed us for a long time, you know as well. While we were doing the cloud and putting outsized investment in our tech transformation for the obvious long-term strategic reasons and competitive reasons, we've been making the right investments in '21, '22, '23, '24, in new products and other resources, commercial resources, et cetera. So we're investing the right amount to grow Equifax today, and those incremental savings from the cloud will flow through to expand our margins. Same way that we've talked about is, when the mortgage market returns, we'll let that flow through. We're not going to reinvest that. We're investing the right amounts to grow Equifax at 8% to 12% and deliver that 50 bps of kind of what I'll call ongoing operating leverage from running the company. So, as we have like mortgage market recovery or, as you point out, the cloud cost savings, those are going to flow through and they're going to allow us to not only expand our margins, but as John pointed out, with our leverage coming down, we're getting closer to that stage, which we've been after for, as you know, quite some time to start returning cash to shareholders. Jeff Meuler : Got it. And then when you were describing, I think it was OIS, you mentioned the ID and fraud softness this quarter. So, I'm guessing that's Kount and Midigator, correct me if I'm wrong. But what drove that? How quickly can it recover and how is international doing for Kount and Midigator? John Gamble : Yes. So if we take a look at Kount and Midigator together, what we saw actually was, let's call it, the fraud part -- portion of the business performed better. We continue to see growth. We saw a little bit of weakness in chargeback management, which is, let's call, the Midigator part of the business, right? So we're expecting -- we've launched a lot of new products and platforms now in Kount, right? Kount 360 is now live. We're expecting to see that platform take hold. So we're expecting to see improved performance as we move through the rest of this year around Kount. And then around chargeback management, as we integrate chargeback management into the Kount 360 platform, we would expect to see some improvement there as well. So -- but I'd say that what we're seeing -- and it's a good news on the margin front, because the fraud business has better margins. We're seeing a little bit of performance in fraud, and given the launch of new products, our expectation is that the area will see improved performance first as we go through the rest of the year. Jeff Meuler : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Scott Wurtzel from Wolfe Research. Your line is now live. Scott Wurtzel : Great. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my questions here. Just wanted to go back first to the Vitality Index in EWS, and pretty notable sequential acceleration there. It seems like there was a decent amount of contribution there from talent, but just wondering if there were any other kind of notable positive outliers there that were contributing to the sequential acceleration in growth. Thanks. Mark Begor : Yeah. As you know, EWS has been really outperforming our 10% kind of vitality goal for, gosh, almost three years now, principally after they completed the cloud, and it was a real step-up. So they've had -- really broad-based in all their verticals, focused on innovation and new products. You point out talent, where they've rolled out some products and they've got more in the pipeline. And so, there was clearly some benefit there from products that were put in place late last year and in the first-half of this year. Mortgage has got products that they've rolled out. So there's probably some benefit there. We -- while we lapped Mortgage 36, they've got some other solutions that they're bringing in. Employer, we've got a new I-9 solution called I-9 Virtual that's in the marketplace. So, that vertical is focused on new products. And government is also -- got some focus there. So we've been quite energized about EWS, call it, above framework, ability to execute on innovation. We'd expect them, over time, to move back towards the 10%, but they've been well above it for the last three years. And as we talked about, international had a good quarter on innovation and so did USIS in -- even in the midst of their cloud work. Scott Wurtzel : Got it. That's helpful. And just as a quick follow-up on the international side, I mean, one of your peers recently had called out some headwinds to growth in Brazil during the past quarter as a result of some flooding. And just wondering if you guys had any impact from that at all in second quarter here. John Gamble : We did. We have the -- it's -- it was in Brazil, right? And there's -- there was a substantial flooding in the South of Brazil and it certainly impacted our business, although our Brazil business has actually performed fairly consistently with the plans we put in place when we started the year. So... Mark Begor : Yes. No, we're pleased. We're pleased with Boa Vista's performance. We talked about a bunch of the solutions that we're bringing there now that should benefit the second-half in '25 as we complete the integration. We're just lapping -- getting close to lapping the 12-month mark from acquiring the business, but we're well down the path on integration and rolling in our new products and bringing in our platforms, like Ignite and Interconnect and some of the other new product solutions. So, we're quite optimistic about our Boa Vista acquisition and the opportunity for growth going forward. Scott Wurtzel : Great. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Kyle Peterson from Needham & Company. Your line is now live. Kyle Peterson : Great. Thanks, and good morning, guys. I wanted to start off on the records growth. It seems really strong there. Just want to see if you guys could unpack kind of what drove kind of some of the new additions. I know you guys have been talking about Gig and such, as well as some of these HR software partnerships. So, I guess, like if you kind of rank order what some of the bigger contributors were to the net new records this quarter, that'd be really helpful. Mark Begor : Yes. I would say, similar to earlier question, it's broad-based. I think you're seeing the benefits of having a fully dedicated team and leader reporting to the leader of EWS, reporting into Chad. Joe Muchnick is the leader who's driving that. And I think we made that change in December and you've seen just the ability to just drive more of those strategic partnerships, which has really been quite positive. It is broad-based. We add records from individual relationships when we're doing employer solutions like I-9, UC, WOTC and other things with them. We've -- as we point out, we added four new partnerships in the quarter. We see a pipeline of those, and those partnerships are with pension administrators, they're with HR software companies, as you point out, and they're with the traditional payroll processors. And remember, when you think about the TAM, if you will, for records, there's roughly, the way we think about it, 225 million working Americans. We're north of 132 million individuals in our data set. Just a long runway for growth going forward. And we've clearly, gosh, over the last three years, five years, six years, seven years been outgrowing our framework for records over the long-term, which is kind of three points, four points of record growth per year is what we think about over the long-term. But there's just been a lot of momentum, given our focus and resources we've been putting on it. Kyle Peterson : That's really helpful. And I just wanted to follow-up on auto, some of the moving pieces that you guys have seen there. I know you guys called out kind of the CDK issue. It seems like that's, I guess, largely resolved itself, but I guess, should we... Mark Begor : Yes. Kyle Peterson : Think of that as kind of a late 2Q, maybe first week or so of 3Q impact? And I guess, if so, how are you guys thinking about auto, ex that impact for the -- at least for the balance of the year? Mark Begor : Yes. I think we tried to highlight that we've seen really for the last, call it, couple of quarters some impact from higher interest rates on auto loans dampening some of the auto credit underwriting. So -- and I would say, we don't expect that to change in the second-half and we've reflected that in our framework until rates come down. Kyle Peterson : Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Your line is now live. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Hey, Mark, I just want to get a little beat on the overall consumer credit environment. I mean, it sounds from your comments that there's some deterioration sequentially. And what I'm trying to understand, is it deterioration from the bank side of things? Is it deterioration from the consumers just saying, hey, I can't afford some of the loans? And what are you seeing over there? And some of the financial and marketing area, the area that has portfolio review, are you seeing some impact over there with the growth in revenue moving up to 7%? If you could just give us a little bit of color? And then I have a follow-up. Mark Begor : Yes. I think there's been some slight softening of, I would call it, consumer demand. Like, the consumer is still strong, outside of the subprime consumer, which we know has been impacted by inflation, which -- while it's coming down on a two-year basis, what they're buying is still a bigger part of their disposable income, whether it's groceries or fuel, it's clearly impacted the subprime consumer. It's really around the rates. We saw it in mortgage, obviously. Mortgage, we've seen the impact of higher rates really impacting the mortgage market meaningfully over the last couple of years. And I think in the last six months, we've seen that flow to a less -- much lesser degree, but obviously, a negative impact in auto where you've got payments on a car with the higher rates are just substantially higher than they were a couple of years ago, and that's impacting some level of auto purchases. I think you've seen the inventories by the car dealers increase, which is probably an indicator of consumer demand there because of higher rates. And until we see some reduction in rates, I would expect that auto would be somewhat dampened. It's a -- it's probably the one that we've seen the most of. Outside of that, I think the other verticals are kind of continuing to move along. It's not a customer impact. Our customers are still strong. Our customers are still focused on growing their businesses. I think it's more of an end user demand on the consumer side. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay, great. Thanks. And then you made a comment about the impact to margins, the reason margin guidance was lowered was just the timing of the cutover and some of the transition, but shouldn't impact 2025 outlook. Just trying to understand if things go out a quarter, why doesn't that snowball into 2025? Why wouldn't I kind of think about that as a 2025 number, also being kind of a quarter behind? Mark Begor : Yeah. So I think John commented that we're at the finish line with a lot of these transformations. But when we move all our customers, there's a couple of months of overlap before we shut down the legacy infrastructure as we complete decommissioning those infrastructures. And that's still in our run rate, meaning we're still paying for those duplicate infrastructures, the new cloud and the legacy infrastructure. That will come out of '24. So we'll have full run rate in 2025, but it's delayed a couple of months because of some of the final work we're doing to complete, principally USIS, and I would say, yes, Canada is the other one that we're a few weeks behind and that pushes out those savings. So we have less benefit in '24, but we get the full benefit in '25. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Owen Lau from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live. Owen Lau : Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. So, going back to Mark's earlier comments about rate cut, the market currently expects the rate -- to cut rate by, I think, 50 basis points to 75 basis points this year, and it may even start in September. Let's say, if the Fed cuts by 50 basis point, how much incremental benefit do you think Equifax can capture? And how do you think about all these for this year? Thank you. Mark Begor : Yes, that's a tough one to actually put a point estimate on there. It's obviously going to be good news when the Fed cut rate -- cuts rates, principally in our mortgage vertical. I think you saw the chart in the deck that inquiries are down 50% from what we would call normal levels. We would expect that activity to recover as rates come down and you've got the kind of the macro challenges of consumers -- homeowners, better term, in a home at a 3% or 4% mortgage and likely want to upgrade or change, but are waiting to see rates come down from kind of the high-6s or that kind of range before they make that move. So, there's not a lot of inventory on the market. We would expect that to be positive going forward. And we've tried to frame for you that if you look at where we are today versus what we characterize as normal, that's $1.1 billion of incremental revenue, which is a huge number that -- we would expect, over time, that activity to go back towards normal. We'll see how it goes and, of course, how does the Fed move rates. The interest rates in the United States from the Fed are the highest, I think, pretty much in the globe today and they're 25-year high for the United States. It's -- we all believe, or we certainly believe that they will come down over time and then we'll have a big positive from the mortgage market recovery that we've been clear that will flow through our P&L and drive our margin expansion and free cash generation substantially as that comes back into our financials. Owen Lau : Got it. That's helpful. And then I remember, last quarter, talent revenue was down 4% and you saw some recovery in March and continued in April. In the second quarter, it was up 13%. Was it because of some pent-up demand from January or February, or high market has actually improved that you see the growth will be more sustainable? Thanks. Mark Begor : I think the biggest driver -- John, you can jump in also, in talent is just continued penetration in that TAM, meaning customer wins, getting to top of waterfall, meaning they're using our solution first, kind of position some of the new products. What would you add on that, John, for talent? John Gamble : Well, we also saw really nice performance in some Insights products... Mark Begor : Yes. John Gamble : Meaning incarceration that's used in background checks, and we also started to see some growth around some education products. So, generally speaking, as we talked about last quarter, January and February are very weak in terms of hiring. What we saw was weaker-than-normal and then we saw a recovery in March and we got a little better performance in the second quarter because of that recovery also in our normal income and employment products, but also because we saw nice performance from some of the other products that we use that support the talent market. Owen Lau : All right. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners. Your line is now live. Craig Huber : Great. Thank you. Can you discuss, if you would, your AI spending here? I'm just curious, the dollars you're spending on that and going forward here, are you doing that within the context of, say, your normal technology budget, putting aside the cloud and stuff, within -- inside your normal technology budget here or it's just displacing other spending that you normally would do on the technology side\u2026 Mark Begor : No, no, there's.. Craig Huber : Incremental. Mark Begor : Yes. Craig Huber : That it's actually hurting margins? Mark Begor : Yes. And it's -- well, I don't know. We don't -- I don't think about it's hurting our margins, but we're investing for obvious reasons in what we believe is a very important growth lever for us of enhancing our scores, models, and products using AI and ML. This isn't new at Equifax, but we've been consistently increasing our focus and spend around resources and capabilities for AI. The tech transformation provides a big lever there with our own AI capabilities and then leveraging that with Google's Vertex AI. So, being in the cloud is a big positive for us. And then we've been investing in more resources and people. I mentioned that we brought on a really strong leader from the industry -- it was actually from one of our customers, that we're excited to have in the business to lead AI and ML for us. You've seen the use of AI expanding. We had a goal of 80% of our models and scores this year to be using our new AI and ML. And I think we're at 89% in the quarter, so north of our goal, which is a good thing. As we move forward, we will move to 100%, right? That's where we're heading. So this is a big lever, and it's one of the pillars of our EFX 2026 strategic priorities, is to really leverage. And what it's going to deliver for our customers is just higher-performing solutions. They're going to be more predictable. They'll help them drive higher approval rates at lower losses, or higher identity validations in our identity businesses. We're super energized and the ability to have all of our data in a single data fabric and to have the Equifax cloud substantially complete as we finish up in the next number of weeks in the USIS, that gives us big, big opportunities to really take our product capabilities and really charge them with AI and ML. So we're super-excited about this as a priority going forward. John Gamble : And when you think about spending, like a significant amount of our capital spending is around getting data into fabric to make it available easily across all of our businesses, which dramatically accelerates AI and ML. So, compare our spending to what other companies talk about in AI and ML, you would probably need to include a bunch of the transformation spending we're doing, because we're doing data normalization in a way that other companies have to do, but we're doing it as part of our ongoing process improvements. So we're spending substantially on AI and ML. Craig Huber : And then my follow-up question, please. On credit cards, you just touched on your outlook there for the rest of the year-on a year-over-year basis. Just refresh us what happened again in the first quarter and second quarter there. Mark Begor : Yes, no change in the second-half from the first quarter. As you know, there's a small portion of the credit card space that's in subprime that's went through a cycle in, really, '22 and '23, where there was some dampening there because of credit risk exposure with the subprime consumer. That's flattened out, meaning they're kind of at a run rate level. So, that is behind us. And then in the prime/near-prime, it's still a good business for us and we don't see any real changes there. John Gamble : Yes. Banking and lending, we said, has been growing kind of mid-single-digits, a little higher in the first, a little lower in a second. But that's what it's looked like in the first-half. So we think relatively good performance there. Craig Huber : You expect it to continue like that in the second-half, you're saying? Mark Begor : We do. Again, you go from -- kind of take second-half, take 2025, the consumer is strong, they're working. If you think about prime/near-prime consumers, they're -- have -- they have wage growth and they have balance sheet growth from the equity markets. We've all seen the spending behavior from, broadly, the U.S. consumer base kind of post-COVID is very strong. So, that's a good outlook, and our customers are strong. They have strong balance sheets and these are important businesses for them that they want to keep growing. So they're spending money on marketing and they want to originate. And then for us, if we can continue to deliver differentiated solutions that help them grow their businesses faster, that's going to be a good thing for USIS in the card space and along the rest of FI. Craig Huber : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Toni Kaplan : Thanks so much. I wanted to go back to the mortgage outperformance in Verifier. I think it was just slightly lower than last quarter, and I know you had expected it to be up slightly. Could you just give a little bit more color on what's going on there? Is there a mix component like last quarter that was unfavorable? Just any sort of drivers that maybe led to a little bit of a worse expectation? John Gamble : Yes. Toni, we would characterize it as much consistent with the guidance we gave, right? Slight up to slight down is pretty close to the same thing. So we think we were very consistent with the guidance we gave. I can't point to anything specific, right, as to why there would be a small variances between where it came in and what we said. But overall, it was fairly consistent with what we expected, which is what gives us some comfort that as we go through into the second-half of the year that we're going to see the improved performance that we expect because, again, we talked about it multiple times because of records, right? So we feel good about that. Toni Kaplan : Okay. Great. And then I wanted to ask another on International, just very strong organic growth this quarter. It looked like LATAM was really the standout there with 30% organic growth. Have you seen share gains there? Or is it still a little bit too early? And just how are you thinking about LATAM for the rest of the year? Mark Begor : Yes. In LATAM, the principal driver in there is outside of Brazil. Brazil had a good quarter, and we do expect over the medium and long-term to continue to grow that business well, but it's still early days in Brazil. But strong performance in really most of the markets in Latin America, driven by new products and innovation, Argentina, Chile, a lot of the markets where we have strong leadership positions in those markets. But if you go across the rest of International, U.K. CRA was very strong. U.K. debt management was very strong. Those are growing kind of above market in U.K., particularly CRA, had another very good quarter and likely some share gains in that market. Canada was just above mid-single-digits, which was a very good performance. Australia, below where we would like them to be, but we expect them to recover as it moves forward. But product -- new products, a very positive driver across International as they're driving innovation. John Gamble : And we -- gave full-year guidance. So again, I think we gave a perspective on where we expect the year to come in. We expect International to perform well. We expect LATAM to perform well, not quite as strong as the second quarter, but still the rest of the year should be good. Toni Kaplan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. George Tong : Hi, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to go back to an earlier point, which was in the USIS nonmortgage business, you saw a continuation of tight credit conditions that impacted the auto market and... Mark Begor : That's not what I said, George. But go ahead. George Tong : Yes. I guess how are you thinking about the broader credit conditions in the second-half of the year? Mark Begor : Just to clarify, I did not say that there were tight credit conditions in auto. There are in subprime, but that's old news, right? That happened a year ago, two years ago, in '22 and '23, as I think you know. What I talked about was our view that the high rates in auto are impacting end-user demand for financing automobiles, meaning buying automobiles in the last couple of quarters. And it's really a follow-on of what we see in mortgage. The payment levels now for a new car for someone who's financing it are substantially higher than they were a couple of years ago. So we think that's impacted consumer demand, not credit underwriting. So just to clarify that. And I'm sorry, the second-half of your question was what? George Tong : In the second-half of the year, how are you thinking about broader credit conditions, not just in auto, but just broadly. Mark Begor : Yes. So from a credit conditions, we see the consumer continuing to be strong. Employment is high, unemployment is low. That's always a positive for underwriting when the consumers are working. Broadly, credit scores are still strong. I think we've talked before with you and others about the impact of subprime, but that's kind of flattened out from the declines we saw in '22 and '23. And another thing that we think a lot about on credit conditions is the strength of your customers, meaning other financial institutions, and they're broadly very strong. So those elements are very good. The one area -- two areas, obviously, we're seeing impact on consumer demand because of rates is clearly mortgage has been substantial, which we've talked at length about, and then we're seeing some impact in auto. George Tong : Got it. And then in EWS non-mortgage, a lot of the growth is linked from record additions and volumes. Can you talk a bit about how much pricing is contributing to growth, particularly in Verifications? Mark Begor : Yes. As you know, we have four really principal levers in EWS, records is one. And as you point out, it's been very strong, which we're pleased with. Price is one. As you know, we don't disclose price but it's one lever. You should think about, George, that we have substantial benefits from penetration, meaning penetrating into new verticals. I think we've talked about that in Government and Talent and others. And then product is a big deal, bringing new solutions that deliver more value to our customers, meaning whether it's multiple data solutions or more historical data, those are generally at a different higher price point because they're bringing more value. But those four levers over the long-term, we think about as being equally weighted in the 13% to 15% and then add some market on top of that, meaning market growth. That's how you get to the 13% to 15%. So we're really energized to have those strong levers. When you think about EWS, clearly, the records -- ability to add records is very unique to that business and most data businesses. So it's a lever that we don't have in other businesses. I would argue penetration is also one that we don't have in other businesses. We don't compete with manual in other businesses. We generally compete with competitors like TU and Experian competing with manual is one that gives us the opportunity to add real value from a productivity standpoint, as well as the speed and accuracy standpoint of instant data that comes from EWS. George Tong : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Mark Begor : Thanks, George. Operator : Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Trevor Burns for any further closing comments. Trevor Burns : Yes. Thanks, everybody, for their time today. And if you have any follow-up questions, just reach out to me -- Look forward to catching up throughout the quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the Equifax Inc. Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Trevor Burns, SVP, Head of Corporate Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Trevor Burns : Thanks, and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Trevor Burns. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the IR Calendar section of the News and Events tab at our Investor Relations website. During the call, we will be making reference to certain materials that can also be found in the presentation section of the News and Events tab at our IR website. These materials are labeled 3Q 2024 earnings conference call. Also, we will making uncertainty forward-looking statements including fourth quarter and full year 2024 guidance as well as certain 2025 guidance to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors that may impact our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2023 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. We will also be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, included in adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included in our earnings release and can be found in the Financial Results section of the Financial Info tab at our IR websites. In the third quarter, Equifax incurred a restructuring charge for cost reduction actions aligned with the completion of the migration of significant data exchanges and applications in the United States and Canada in certain countries in Latin America to the Equifax Cloud as well as cost taxes to streamline our workforce globally. These charges totaled $42 million and are expected to be -- and expected to deliver ongoing savings when completed in early 2025 of over $70 million a year. We expect to generate greater savings as we complete cloud migration in Europe, the remainder of Latin America and Brazil and Australia and New Zealand, principally over '25 and '26. Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark. Mark Begor : Thanks, Trevor and good morning. Before I cover our strong third quarter results, I want to update you on the strong progress of our cloud transformation. In the quarter, USIS completed the migration onto the cloud data fabric of the remaining customers and services for their consumer credit and telco and utilities exchanges, which is a huge milestone. Along with EWS, the work number exchange, which we completed migrating to the Equifax Cloud over two years ago, we now have our three largest data exchanges in the new Equifax Cloud. As of the end of September, we have about 80% of Equifax revenue in the Equifax Cloud and expect to approach 90% of our revenue in the Equifax Cloud by year-end. The cloud migrations have been a huge effort across Equifax over the past four plus years, requiring a ton of focus by the entire Equifax team. We expect to have a significant competitive advantage as we fully deploy our new cloud capabilities and pivot from building to leveraging the cloud in 2025 and beyond that will allow us to fully focus on customers' growth, innovation, new products and AI. Leaving the USIS consumer and telco and utility migrations to the Equifax Cloud allowed us to begin decommissioning legacy on-prem systems and software in USIS in the third quarter supporting our goal of cloud spending reductions in 2024, which expand our operating margins and are lowering the capital intensity of our businesses -- our business in 2025 and beyond. In the third quarter, we also made substantial progress in our international technology transformation activities with Canada completing migration of all customers off of their consumer and commercial credit exchanges onto the new EFX Cloud Data Fabric. This is another big accomplishment for the international team with cloud migrations in Argentina, Chile and the Dominican Republic completed earlier in the year, adding to Canada's completion a few weeks ago. Our international cloud migration efforts will continue in '25 and '26, resulting in additional cloud savings as those migrations are completed. It is energizing to be approaching the finish line of our cloud transformation. We are entering the next chapter of the new Equifax as we pivoted from building the new Equifax Cloud to leveraging our new cloud capability to drive our top and bottom line. Turning to Slide 4. We had a strong third quarter with reported revenue of $1.42 billion, up 9% and at the top end of our July guidance. With organic constant dollar revenue up 10%, which is at the top end of our long-term growth framework. Adjusted EBITDA margins at just under 33% were in line with our expectations and adjusted EPS of $1.85 per share was the top end of our July guidance. Our global non-mortgage businesses, which represent about 80% of total revenue in the quarter had strong 10% constant currency revenue growth which was in line with our expectations. Non-mortgage organic constant currency revenue growth was 8% in the quarter. The strong non-mortgage performance was driven by 9% growth in EWS and with very strong 19% non-mortgage growth in EWS Verifier, led by very strong 29% growth in government and talent that was up over 9% in EWS. USIS non-mortgage revenue growth of almost 5% was stronger than our expectations, principally from our consumer business and financial marketing services, our off-line batch business. International delivered just under 18% constant dollar revenue growth and strong 12% organic growth, led by continued strong growth in Latin America and Europe. Total U.S. mortgage revenue was up 17% in the quarter and above our July guidance. U.S. mortgage revenue was 20% of Equifax revenue in the quarter. In late September, as mortgage rates declined to just over 6%, we saw modest mortgage inquiry activity increases. We believe this improvement was likely led by mortgage refi activity off the lower mortgage rates. New home purchase activity appears to have remained at the lower levels we've been seeing throughout 2024, reflecting continued low home inventory levels elevated home prices impacting affordability and prospective homebuyers waiting for further mortgage rate reductions. As mortgage rates increased in early October to over 6.6%, we have seen mortgage activity reduced to levels closer to what we saw in July and August. John will cover our expectations for mortgage activity in the fourth quarter shortly, but we continue to believe that activity will improve towards 2015 and 2019 levels as mortgage rates come down in the future. In the third quarter, the growth in mortgage revenue was driven principally by USIS where mortgage revenue was up a strong 36% and slightly above our expectations. This strong growth was again driven by the benefit of strong vendor pricing actions and the performance of our new mortgage pre-qual products. The lower mortgage rates we saw in late September did drive a small increase in mortgage application activity, which benefited USIS in the quarter. EWS mortgage revenue returned to growth with revenue up 4% and was also slightly better than our expectations. As a reminder, EWS mortgage inquiry volumes lagged USIS credit inventory volumes as credit is pulled earlier in the mortgage application cycle than income and employment, which is typically pulled in the middle and of course, the closing of the mortgage application. USIS typically sees the benefits of mortgage shopping behavior earlier and to a greater extent than EWS. As a result, EWS did not see the same level of incremental inquiry volume as USIS did from the slight increase in mortgage activity that occurred in late September. EWS mortgage revenue exceeded twin inquiry volume by about 9.5% in the quarter, up a very strong 300 basis points sequentially from second quarter, principally from strong twin record growth. Equifax had another strong quarter of new product innovation with a VI or Vitality Index of 13%, above our 10% guidance for the year and our long-term framework of 10% Vitality. We saw strong broad based new product rollouts with double-digit growth in EWS and International and a VI of 9% in USIS, which was up 100 basis points sequentially from the second quarter. We expect our NPI revenue to grow -- revenue growth to remain strong and are increasing our 2024 Vitality Index guidance to 11%, up 100 basis points from our prior framework for 2024, as we further leverage our new EFX Cloud capabilities in EFX.AI to drive new products into the marketplace. Turning to Slide 5. Workforce Solutions revenue was up about 7.5% and slightly below our July guidance, principally due to lower-than-expected employer services revenue. Non-mortgage verification services revenue, again, delivered very strong 19% growth, which was in line with our expectations. Government had another outstanding quarter with very strong 29% revenue growth from continued penetration in their large $5 billion government TAM. Government revenue grew sequentially from strong growth in state penetration and insights incarceration data solutions. We expect continued strong sequential growth -- sequential government revenue growth again in the fourth quarter. Growth rates in the fourth quarter are expected to continue to show strong double-digit performance, but will be lower than third quarter levels, principally due to comping against very strong growth we saw last year. We expect our government vertical to continue to deliver very strong double-digit growth in the future and outgrow both Equifax and EWS. Talent Solutions revenue was up a strong 9% in the quarter. Talent Solutions continues to benefit from their new total verified data hub, which includes trended employment data as well as insights incarceration, education and licensing and credentialing data. Based on data through August, EWS Talent Solutions outperformed the BLS white-collar hiring markets by approximately 18 percentage points from additions of records, the rollouts of new products and penetration into the talent vertical during the quarter. We did see somewhat weaker volumes late in September, which we have assumed will continue and is expected to impact talent revenue growth in the fourth quarter. EWS mortgage revenue was up 4% in the quarter and slightly better than our July guidance. Twin inquiries in the third quarter were down about 5.5% and slightly better than our July guidance. Total EWS mortgage revenue outperformed Twin inquiries by about 9.5% and again over 300 points sequentially from strong record growth during the quarter. We expect strong growth in twin records to benefit mortgage and our other EWS verticals again in the fourth quarter. EWS consumer lending revenue was up 16% from strong double-digit growth in P loans and high single-digit growth in debt management and auto. Employer Services revenue was down 19% in the quarter and weaker than we expected. Compared to last year, employer declined principally from lower ERC revenues and to a lesser extent, lower I-9 and onboarding revenues as the slower white-collar hiring we saw in late September impacting talent solutions also impacted our onboarding business. There was also some onetime post-COVID related project revenue that benefited onboarding in the third quarter of last year. Third quarter I-9 and onboarding revenue was consistent with the first and second quarters, and we expect fourth quarter employer revenue to be down mid-single digits as the ERC comparisons mitigate. Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margins were 51.6% and were slightly above our expectations and continued to be very strong, reflecting strong Verifier revenue growth and continued strong cost controls. Turning to Slide 6. The EWS government team continued their very strong performance in the quarter with revenue up 29%. The government team continued to focus on penetration of our unique VOI and VOE solutions for social services at both the federal level and across the state agencies. In the quarter, the EWS government team signed an extension to their SSA redetermination contract to provide income and employment data for individuals applying for or currently receiving social security disability income and supplemental security income benefits with a potential contract value of about $500 million over the next five years. EWS services support program integrity for the SSA as well as reducing the administrative burden for consumers seeking these important services. Chad and the government team are on offense driving penetration in the big $5 billion government TAM. Turning to Slide 7. EWS had another outstanding quarter of new record additions. A few weeks ago, we announced a new strategic partnership with Workday to provide verification services to Workday's large customer base. Later in the fourth quarter, we'll begin rolling out the free value-added EWS income and employment verification services to Workday's U.S. customers and expect to onboard a sizable number of new records through 2025 from this new strategic relationship. Also in the quarter, we signed agreements with five additional new strategic partners that will contribute over 5 million records collectively to the twin database in the future. Through September, EWS has executed 12 strategic partnerships during 2024 and since the beginning of 2021, EWS has completed 45 strategic partnership agreements. We expect these five new partnerships signed during the quarter to come online and begin generating revenue late in the fourth quarter and substantially in the early parts of 2025. In the third quarter, EWS added 2 million active records to the twin database, ending the quarter with $182 million active records, up a strong 12% on 134 million unique individuals. EWS now has 3.8 million companies contributing income and employment records to the twin database every pay period, a very strong 40% CAGR since 2020. Total records are now over $700 million and up 11% in the quarter, supporting our trended or historical solutions with about half of Verifier revenue from products, including historical records. At 134 million unique active records, we have plenty of room to grow the twin database towards the TAM of 225 million income producing Americans. Turning to Slide 8. USIS achieved a major milestone in the third quarter, completing the migration to the new Equifax Data Cloud Fabric of both the U.S. consumer credit and our cell phone utility databases. This big milestone makes U.S. consumer credit, telco and utility data fully available across our new data fabric for use in advanced AI based solutions to enhance our identity and fraud solutions and to accelerate our only Equifax solutions leveraging both EWS and USIS data assets. It also allows our U.S. commercial product and technology teams to fully shift their focus to delivering these new advanced Equifax solutions to customers that will drive new product rollouts and top line growth for Equifax. USIS revenue was up 12% in the quarter and well above the July guidance of up 8.5% and their long-term revenue growth framework of 6% to 8%, despite the continuation of some weakness in the FI and auto end markets. This was driven by both strong performance in non-mortgage revenue as well as stronger mortgage revenue, reflecting the slight increase in mortgage activity that we saw in late September. Total non-mortgage revenue was up 5% in the quarter and was also well above our July guidance of over 2% growth for USIS. We saw strong double-digit growth in Consumer Solutions and Financial Marketing Services which were offset by a less than 1% decline in USIS B2B online revenue from softer consumer and end market demand, which importantly was up about 300 basis points sequentially. We USIS B2B online saw double-digit growth in insurance and commercial, high single-digit growth in telco and low to mid-single-digit revenue growth in banking and auto offset by declines in third-party bureau sales and identity and fraud. We expect third-party bureau sales to be about flat in the fourth quarter as we lap the weakness that started in late 2023. Identity and Fraud revenue was also down and weaker than our expectations, principally due to weakness in chargeback management volumes. Payment and transactional identity revenue grew in the quarter from penetration in large strategic accounts identity and fraud is starting to launch their new Kount 360 solutions platform and products, which will help strengthen growth in 2025, as these solutions take hold in the marketplace. Financial marketing services, our B2B offline business was up a very strong 14% in the quarter, reflecting substantial new wins and customer expansion across banking services and payments verticals and as well as continued strong growth in prescreen marketing and our unique IXI wealth data. USIS consumer solutions D2C business had another very strong quarter, up 17%, and from strong double-digit growth in our consumer direct channel and from strong customer acquisition trends. We expect fourth quarter revenue to grow mid-single-digits as we start comping against very strong D2C growth last year. USIS mortgage revenue was up a very strong 36% and better than our July guidance. Mortgage credit inquiries were up 1% and were also better than our July guidance of down 7%, principally due to the slight increase in mortgage activity that we saw in late September. This was the first quarter of mortgage credit inquiry growth since the first quarter of 2021, which is a big milestone and reinforces for us that the mortgage market is clearly bottomed and poised for recovery in the future. Consistent with the first half, the strong pricing environment along with the strength in our new mortgage pre-qual products also drove the very strong mortgage revenue growth. At $137 million, mortgage revenue was just under 30% of total USIS revenue in the quarter. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 33.9% in the quarter, up 70 basis points sequentially and in line with our expectations from higher-than-expected revenue growth, offset by higher technology costs to complete cloud customer migration activities. With the USIS consumer and our cell phone utility and data cloud transformation is complete, Chad and the USIS team are clearly focused on offense and growth. Turning to Slide 9. International revenue was a very strong 18% in constant currency and up a strong 12% in organic constant currency, excluding the impact of BVS due to continued very strong growth in Latin America and Europe. Europe local currency revenue was up a very strong 9% in the quarter with continued strong 7% growth in our credit and data businesses and 12% growth in our debt management business. Latin America local currency revenue was up 58%, principally due to the acquisition of Boa Vista with very strong organic growth of 31%, led by 28% Vitality Index from new products in the region during the quarter. And as a reminder, we closed the BVS acquisition in August last year. Canada delivered 1% growth in the quarter, which was below our expectations from a softer economy. I previously mentioned that Canada completed their consumer and commercial credit exchange customer migrations to data fabric a few weeks ago. And similar to the U.S., we expect to see accelerating NPI and revenue growth going forward from the Canadian team. Asia-Pacific revenue returned to growth up 2% as expected. International adjusted EBITDA margins of 27.7% and were up 210 basis points sequentially from strong revenue growth and good cost execution. Turning to Slide 10. We continue to make very strong progress driving innovation with 30 new products launched in the quarter that delivered a 13% vitality from broad based performances across all of our business units. EWS had very strong third quarter with Vitality Index of 16%, expanding solutions in the government vertical as well as incorporating incarceration education into new talent solutions products. USIS saw continued sequential improvement with a Vitality Index of 9%, up 100 basis points sequentially from the second quarter. We expect USIS to continue to show strong vitality improvement from the cloud completion as they leverage our new cloud native infrastructure for innovation in new products as well as free up their product and technology resources that previously were working on cloud transformation in key verticals such as identity and fraud, commercial and our new mortgage pre-qual products. International also had strong 11% vitality in the quarter with a strong focus on identity and fraud solutions. We expect strong double-digit vitality in the fourth quarter, leveraging our Equifax Cloud capability to drive new product rollouts and we're raising our full year Vitality Index guidance from 10% to about 11%, reflecting the strong innovation performance across all our businesses so far in 2024. AI and ML are changing the way we develop our new products in our single data fabric and build higher performing model scores and products for our customers. We are accelerating the pace at which we are developing new EFX models and scores using our advanced AI and ML capabilities in areas such as identity and fraud and consumer loan affordability, it will drive higher performance and predictability. In the quarter, 100% of our new models and scores were built using Equifax AI and machine learning, which is up from about 89% last quarter and ahead of our 2024 goal of 80% and last year's 70%. We're clearly on offense deploying our proprietary EFX AI capabilities that will drive higher performing model scores and products for our customers. Now I'd like to turn it over to John to provide more detail on our third quarter financial results and to provide our fourth quarter framework. Our fourth quarter guidance builds on our strong third quarter performance from new products, penetration, record growth and pricing. John Gamble : Thanks, Mark. Turning to Slide 11. As Mark discussed, we started to see an improvement in the run rate of USIS credit inquiries in late September as mortgage rates declined to just over 6%. We believe the improvement principally reflected higher refinance activity in late September. New home purchase activity does not appear to have increased meaningfully at this point, likely reflecting continued low home inventory levels, home prices at near all-time highs and respective homebuyers waiting for further mortgage rate reductions. As a reminder, the normal mix of mortgage originations and defined as the average over the 2015 to 2019 period is about 55% purchase and 45% refinance. In the first two weeks of October, we have seen mortgage inquiry volumes for both credit and twin slow versus September as mortgage rates have increased to above 6.5%. The run rate over the last two weeks of both credit and twin inquiries is relatively consistent with the expectations we had when we provided guidance in July. Consistent with our practice in 2024 and the last several years, our guidance for credit inquiries is based on our current run rates over the last two to four weeks, modified to reflect normal seasonal pattern. This effectively assumes market conditions will continue for the quarter. Our fourth quarter guidance reflects mortgage credit inquiries to be up about 9% versus 4Q '23 and down 16% sequentially. Calendar year '24 mortgage credit inquiries are expected to be down about 7%. For the fourth quarter, we expect USIS mortgage revenue to be up over 4% and much stronger than the underlying mortgage market, reflecting both strong performance in mortgage pre-qual products as well as vendor pricing actions. Our guidance reflects TWN inquiries in the fourth quarter to be up about 6% versus 4Q '23 and down about 12% sequentially. For the full year, TWN inquiries are expected to be down about 11%. We expect EWS mortgage revenue to be up over 16% in the fourth quarter and much stronger than the underlying TWN inquiries, again, principally reflecting strong record growth in 2024 and as well as annual mortgage pricing that occurs early in the first quarter each year. As a reminder, the fourth quarter is historically seasonally the lowest quarter of the year for both credit and TWN inquiries. For perspective, as we look to 2025, carrying these current run rates with normal seasonality TWN '25, mortgage credit inquiries would grow versus 2024, up just over 5% for the year and also just over 5% in the first quarter of 2025. Slide 12 provides the details of our 4Q '24 guidance. In 4Q '24, we expect total Equifax revenue to be between $1.438 billion and $1.458 billion, up about 9% at the midpoint. Organic constant dollar revenue growth at the midpoint is about 10% and at the high end of our long-term financial framework. At the midpoint, mortgage revenue is expected to be up almost 30% and non-mortgage constant dollar revenue up over 7%. Equifax 4Q '24 adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be about 35.5% at the midpoint of our guidance. The sequential increase in EBITDA margins reflects revenue growth and cost management across Equifax, including the decommissioning of USIS legacy consumer and telco and utility systems and Canada legacy consumer and commercial systems. This is our first ever quarter with EBITDA over $500 million. This would be a very strong performance. Adjusted EPS in 4Q '24 is expected to be $2.08 to $2.18 per share, up 18% versus 4Q '23 at the midpoint. The midpoint of our fourth quarter revenue guidance is about $15 million below the levels implied by the guidance we provided in July. The primary driver is lower revenue in EWS and in the employer business driven by lower revenue and onboarding as well as ERC. And this is consistent with the factors that impacted the third quarter and also the slower U.S. hiring Mark referenced earlier that is impacting both onboarding and talent solutions. We believe we are centered at the midpoint of our guidance. Business unit performance in the fourth quarter is expected to be as follows : Workforce Solutions revenue growth is expected to be up about 10%. Non-mortgage revenue should be up about 8% year-to-year. Verifier non-mortgage revenue growth will continue to show strong double-digit growth, although below the levels we saw in the third quarter. Verifier non-mortgage growth will again be driven by strong growth in government and talent. Government revenue growth is expected to grow sequentially and year-to-year. However, year-to-year growth will be below the levels we have seen year-to-date in 2024, as we lap very strong 4Q '23 revenue growth in government. Both Verifier mortgage and non-mortgage revenue growth should benefit from the continued strong growth in TWN records we are seeing throughout 2024. EWS adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be up slightly from the third quarter at about 52%. USIS revenue is expected to be up over 10% year-to-year. Non-mortgage revenue should be up about 3% year-to-year, slightly lower than the third quarter, principally due to lower growth in USIS D2C and as they begin to lap periods of strong growth that started in 4Q '23 and financial marketing services, which is expected to be about flat in the year-to-year. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be over 38%, up very strong sequentially as USIS decommissions legacy consumer and telco and utility systems. International revenue is expected to be up over 9% in constant currency. EBITDA margins are expected to be over 32%, up very strong sequentially, reflecting both revenue growth and good cost control. Slide 13 provides the specifics of our 2024 full year guidance. Constant currency revenue growth is expected to be about 10%, with organic constant currency growth of 8% and within our 7% to 10% long-term organic growth framework. Total mortgage revenue is expected to grow about 12.5% despite the 7% decline in U.S. mortgage credit inquiries. Non-mortgage constant dollar revenue is expected to grow almost 10% with organic growth of over 7%, led by very strong non-mortgage growth in our Workforce Solutions verification services business and in international. This is within our long-term framework. FX is about 180 basis points negative to revenue growth. Adjusted EPS is expected to be $7.30 per share and adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be 32.4%. Adjusted EPS and EBITDA are both expected to grow 9% in 2024, all at the midpoint of our guidance. Capital expenditures in the third quarter are $123 million, down $8 million sequentially. We expect fourth quarter capital expenditures to be just over $105 million, as USIS has completed customer migrations to the U.S. consumer data fabric and Canada has completed customer migrations to their consumer and commercial data fabric. Capital expenditures for 2024 are expected to be about $485 million, which is a year-to-year reduction of about $100 million. As we accelerate our cloud migrations, we are seeing increasing levels of depreciation and amortization. In 2024, D&A, excluding acquisition amortization, is expected to be about $410 million, up about $50 million versus 2023. In 2025, we expect D&A to increase slightly above the $50 million increase we saw in 2024. As of the end of the third quarter, our leverage ratio was 2.8x, and we expect to further reduce leverage in the fourth quarter. We believe this leverage is nicely within the levels required for our current BBB, Baa2 credit ratings. Turning to Slide 14. And as we discussed in July, the U.S. mortgage market is on the order of 50% below its historic average inquiry levels. As the mortgage market recovers towards historic norms that presents -- represents over $1 billion of annual revenue opportunity for Equifax in 2025 and beyond at current product pricing, TWN records contracted and products. We expect this opportunity to increase as we enter 2025 from pricing actions, TWN records and new products. At current mortgage gross margins, this over $1 billion of incremental mortgage revenue would deliver on the order of $700 million of EBITDA and $4 per share that we would expect to move into our P&L as the mortgage market returns to normal levels in 2025 and beyond. Now I'd like to turn it back over to Mark. Mark Begor : Thanks, John. Turning to Slide 15. An important part of our long-term financial framework is delivering strong free cash flow and returning cash to shareholders. We're adding a new cash conversion goal for our long-term framework of 95% or greater, with cash conversion defined as free cash flow as a percent of adjusted net income. During the cloud technology transformation over the last four years, we saw elevated cloud capital expenditures which impacted our free cash flow and cash conversion. Our cash conversion ratio is expected to improve significantly in 2024 to about 80% and as we reduce CapEx and drive higher relative levels of free cash flow. We expect our free cash flow to accelerate in 2025 post our cloud investments as CapEx reduces to 6% to 7% of revenue, supporting cash conversion of over 95%, while strong margin expansion and growth in net income from our underlying operating leverage and cloud cost savings. This strong cash generation positions Equifax to continue to invest in growth with CapEx and bolt-on M&A and begin returning excess free cash flow to shareholders from dividend growth and share repurchases in 2025 and beyond. It's energizing to be approaching this important milestone for our investors as we complete the new Equifax Cloud. Turning to Slide 16. We are entering the next chapter of the new Equifax as we pivot from building the new Equifax Cloud to leveraging our new cloud capability to drive our top and bottom line. We are convinced that our new Equifax Cloud differentiated data assets in our new single data fabric leveraging Equifax.AI and machine learning and market leading businesses will deliver higher revenue growth, expanded margins and accelerating free cash flow. In the middle of Slide 16, we've added the new cash conversion metric to our long-term growth framework. And our long-term growth framework, as you know, is made up of strong revenue growth of 7% to 10% and is led by very strong 13% -- 15% EWS revenue growth. EWS is clearly our largest and fastest-growing business led by strong double-digit non-mortgage verification services revenue growth from our government and talent solutions verticals. As a part of our long-term financial framework, we expect to add 1 to 2 points of revenue growth from bolt-on M&A aligned around strengthening the core of Equifax. Our bolt-on M&A strategy will continue to be focused on strengthening Workforce Solutions adding differentiated data assets across Equifax and growing in the big $20 billion identity and fraud space. As John covered a few minutes ago, the pace of mortgage market recovery will add to our revenue growth as the market returns to normal 2015 to 2019 levels in 2025 and beyond. The mortgage market recovery will also drive our margins and free cash flow from the very high incremental margins from this incremental revenue that we expect to come into Equifax's P&L in 2025 and beyond. We expect operating leverage off our strong 8% to 12% revenue growth to generate 50 basis points of annual EBITDA margin expansion and very strong cash conversion of 95% and above. As margins improve, CapEx declined to 6% to 7% of revenue with the completion of the Equifax Cloud transformation and leverage continues to progress towards 2.5 turns by year-end. We expect our free cash flow to accelerate and that will enable us to start returning cash to shareholders in 2025 and beyond through growing the dividend in a multiyear share buyback program. We are energized to be pivoting from building the Equifax Cloud over the past four years to leveraging our new industry leading cloud and EFX.AI capabilities to drive revenue growth, margin expansion and free cash flow. Wrapping up on Slide 17. Equifax delivered another strong quarter with 11% constant dollar revenue growth, which was at the upper end of our 8% to 12% long-term revenue growth framework work, reflecting the power and breadth of the Equifax business model, strong execution against our EFX 2026 strategic priorities, the resiliency of the U.S. consumer and the strength of our customers. Our very strong 19% EWS non-mortgage Verifier revenue growth, 12% EWS active record growth, strong 13% broad based Vitality Index give us momentum as we enter the fourth quarter and move towards 2025. And as we talked earlier, we took another big step in the quarter towards cloud completion with 80% of our revenue now in the Equifax Cloud, which will enhance our competitiveness, drive innovation and new product development. Entering 2025 with 90% of Equifax revenue in the new Equifax Cloud is a really big milestone, so the team can move towards fully focusing on innovation, new products powered by EFX.AI, customers and growth. I'm energized now more than ever about the future of the new Equifax that will deliver strong 8% to 12% revenue growth, 50 basis points of margin expansion lower capital intensity and expanding free cash flow to invest in Equifax and add bolt-on M&A. And in the future, growing our dividend and positioning to start a multiyear stock buyback program in 2025 and beyond. And with that, operator, let me open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Manav Patnaik of Barclays. Manav Patnaik : I just had a question around kind of the guidance philosophy. So in the prior years, every time you had lowered guidance, I guess, it was mainly due to the mortgage weakness, so we all got wrong but there were some other non-mortgage areas that were weak. And this year, even though mortgage is getting better, you're still lowering guidance. So I'm just curious, is there something about the philosophy in not being conservative? Or is it execution? I was just hoping you could help us clear that up. Mark Begor : Yes, Manav. So there's no change in our philosophy. Our goal is to be super transparent with you and our investors about what we're seeing in the marketplace and what the growth levers are and where we're taking the company. We work to provide guidance that we know how to meet and beat. That's our -- no change in that goal. I've been here six years. And I think as you point out the mortgage decline in '22 and '23 was really quite unusual. But if you look around that, I think we've been pretty consistent about meeting and beating. And if you look through our non-mortgage performance during that '22 and '23 time frame, we think we were pretty consistent. With regards to the third quarter, I think -- I don't think that's your question. I think it's more around the fourth quarter. And we highlighted in our earlier comments that there is some volatility in the marketplace that we're certainly dealing with in some of our verticals. We're really pleased with our third quarter performance. We're pleased with the guidance that we have for the fourth quarter, which is super strong. And as you point out, it's slightly below the guidance that we had last quarter. principally from the EWS employer business. I think we've talked for the last couple of quarters about the impact of the employee retention credits that were really stopped by the IRS earlier this year. We thought there'd be some activity there. There's none. So that's obviously impacting that business inside of Workforce Solutions. And then we also talked over the last couple of quarters about the change the federal government made around work opportunity tax credit and the state's response to getting that in place, we thought the states would be responding a little bit quicker. They haven't, which is pushing some of that revenue likely out of the fourth quarter and into 2025, it's not going to go away. And then to a lesser degree, I think we talked about -- I won't touch mortgage because I don't think that's your point. I'll touch non-mortgage. We talked about some of the slowdowns we saw the background screeners late in September. That was unexpected on our part. I think you've seen a number of corporations across the United States announcing layoffs, whether Boeing is 10% or companies like that. But I think coming into the election, it feels like companies are being a little more prudent about new hiring which is we saw in the background screening volumes late in the month. These are, from my perspective, fairly small impacts when you look at the strong performance in the third quarter and the strong guide we have for the fourth quarter, as John pointed out, in the fourth quarter, we're going to be in the neighborhood of $500 million EBITDA and over $2 a share, which we've never done before. So I think that's strong performance earlier in the year. I think some questioned our ability to deliver the kind of performance we've laid out in the fourth quarter, both from a top line and a margin expansion. I think we're in that direction, admittedly a bit below that but still very, very strong numbers. But just really to the point of your question, no change in our philosophy. We want to put out numbers that are super transparent. We're going to give you what's behind those numbers. And our goal is to have numbers that we can meet and beat. And that has never changed and it won't change in the future. Manav Patnaik : Okay. Fair enough. And just on the tech transformation, I think we're all looking forward to the benefits that can provide to USIS. Can you give us some maybe early signs or examples of what maybe you did with tech transformations in other divisions that give you confidence that we should see some outperformance outside of just the macros on the USIS side? Mark Begor : Yes. it's a great question. We talked about in the last quarter, we did this much on this call, but it's obvious that USIS was clearly impacted in '23 and in the -- really through the third quarter in many regards around all the effort they had to put in the cloud transformation. Canada is in the same boat. These are big, big projects, very intrusive with our customers. The good news is it's done. What we're really encouraged by when we think about USIS, even with that in the second quarter and third quarter, you saw their vitality go up, meaning they were able to start taking advantage of being in the cloud to start moving forward on innovation in new products. That's going to benefit USIS in the fourth quarter, but really principally in 2025. And as you know, they increased their vitality in the second quarter, 100 bps and then again in the third quarter, 100 bps. So we would expect them to move towards that 10% vitality as we get into 2025 and which is really going to be a positive. The cost savings, John already talked about, you saw the charge we took that was expected. That's -- we're executing that, and that's a real positive for our margins, which we've committed to and we're executing on. And the other benefit is two other benefits actually, we'll start to see now that they're in the cloud, as those share gains that we expect to have, we have the close in flight. Those will start showing up in the P&L, some in the fourth quarter, but I think principally in 2025 of being always on and being a cloud-native provider. And then the last one is one that we'll talk more about in February during our fourth quarter call and in 2025 is what we're internally calling only Equifax initiative where we're focused on solutions that combine TWM, our income and employment data with the credit file to make our credit file more valuable. When we talked on the last call about new solutions that we're piloting in the marketplace as we speak around a flag on our credit file that someone's working for mortgage shopping to make our mortgage shopping credit file never valuable, a flag on our auto credit file, same thing that someone is working. That will differentiate our credit file. We think it will drive share gains with our credit file. It should make our credit file more valuable. And I think as you know, we're also adding to our credit file solutions, including our differentiated data from DataX, Teletrack and NCTUE, our cell phone utility data. And these are all solutions only Equifax can do. Our competitors don't have these data assets, so we can strengthen the underlying credit file, which arguably can be commoditized in some solutions and make our product more differentiated. Those are the things that you're going to see going forward. It's what we've been talking about for four years. The good news is now is we can actually execute on it because we're in the cloud with USIS. And I can't really reinforce enough about the impact of the distraction. You could say over the last four years, but your question is around USIS really over the last 18 months, 24 months, of all the efforts that went into complete is really massive technology transformation. The good news is it's done. So that whole team now can take all their energy and effort it was balanced between growing the company, rolling out new products, executing our AI solutions and doing the cloud migrations to just focus on growth. And that gives us a lot of energy as we look to the fourth quarter and then as we move into 2025. Operator : The next question is coming from Kelsey Zhu of Autonomous Research. Kelsey Zhu : Have you sized the incremental record additions from the Workday partnership? And can you talk a little bit more about the time line for those new records to come online? Is it more towards kind of Q1, Q2 next year? Or is it towards second half of next year? Mark Begor : Yes. So maybe a couple of points on that. I'll respond to your specific Workday question, but maybe just make it a little bit wider because Workday is one of many partners we added during the quarter. I think we added a total of six in the quarter. Workday, obviously, a very significant one, a very strategic partnership, but all six of them are. I think we sized that we expect from the other $5 million to something like 5 million records coming on over the coming quarters. It takes time to make those integrations. They're super complex for really our partners side. You've seen very record growth. We're up 12% in the quarter. So you can see that we're executing. We talked about the sizable number of partners we added this year as well as last year and over the last couple of years. And with every partner we have is they add new clients and they're all growing their business every quarter, if you think about an HR software company or payroll processor, when those new clients come on board, they're typically boarded to TWN. So there's growth that's happening with one of our clients. Most of our clients have records going back to clients we added even two, three, four years ago that we haven't fully deployed into Equifax, meaning we're working with them through their technologies through the different databases they have, they're typically not a single tech stack to bring those records in. So we have a lot of opportunity both with current new partners use Workday and the others we added this quarter as well as those we've had over the last couple of three years to add records. And Workday specifically, we haven't sized that except to say it's sizable. I think it's well known that they're a very big company and a big partner, and we're super excited to have that move on board. We expect some records to come on in the fourth quarter, but really the substantial growth from Workday and the other partners we added in the third quarter and those that we expect to add in the fourth quarter to come on in 2020. And I think the other point to remind everyone on the call about, as you know, we talk -- tend to talk a lot about our partner record additions, but we also have a very sizable direct record approach where our employer business is adding new clients. And when we bring those new clients on, we offer that free value added evasive income and employment verification and those become records that become a part of Equifax. And one last reminder, and I think you're seeing the benefits of that in December last year, we changed the organize in EWS. So we have one leader and one team that is solely focused on record additions from HR software companies from payroll processors for 1,099 records and pension records, so really the whole gamut. So we've got a very large focus because you're seeing that pay off. We're really pleased that record additions to 12% are way outgrowing our long-term framework for record additions, which are more in the single-digit range is admittedly, we've been doing that for five plus years. So we've had a lot of really positive momentum there. And I think you know the power of adding a record. The day we add a record, we monetize it across all of our verticals because we're already getting inquiries for that record because our customers send us every query. And then the breadth of our ability to monetize is just scale so substantially from even three, four, five years ago when you go across the spectrum from, call it, higher income consumers, mid-market consumers that are doing mortgages and through auto and auto and P loans and cards and then go to the other end of the spectrum, those that are going after social services at the federal and state level is a very -- there's over 100 million people a year that are getting social services and we've got a big opportunity to grow there. You've seen the growth in Workforce Solutions government vertical that's been, obviously, impacted positively by record additions. So records are a big focus of ours, and we see a lot of momentum going forward. We still have a lot of records to go after with the 225 million working Americans, there's close to 100 million of records we don't have yet. So that's why we added resources and people to keep growing this valuable data set. Kelsey Zhu : Also curious to hear a little more about what's driving the reacceleration of growth in consumer lending vertical within Workforce Solutions, especially because of against the backdrop of a pretty soft end market. So just curious, is it really to new product launches? Is it the pricing? Is it increased customer penetration? Yes, I appreciate your thoughts on this. Mark Begor : Yes, it's really the value of the data set. When you think about consumer lending and I'll use P loans, you could use auto, the value of someone's credit score is super important. It's really, as you know, is a reflection of their past payment behavior of other loans they have and it's really a prediction where they keep paying going forward. So very valuable. When you add to that someone's ability to pay, which means their income and their employment, meaning they're working. Because remember, if you pull a credit report, you have no idea if that individual is actually working today. Did they lose their job last week? Did they retire? What's changing? So the combination of income in employment from EWS with the credit file is very, very valuable. And we have increasing numbers of our customers. As you point out, we roll out new products as well as we drive penetration of customers understanding the value of pulling the credit report with income and employment, they can approve more consumers and approve more consumers with lower loss rates. So that's a really strong combination and very positive for our customers. So that's what we're really seeing in the outgrowth of the underlying market. As you point out, there is in some of those verticals, some end user, meaning consumer demand pressures primarily because of higher APRs, particularly in bigger ticket transactions, think about P loans or cards, we have a solution between -- by combining credit with income and employment that allows our customers to approve more of those applicants with a higher degree of confidence around their ability to repay the loan when you add the income and employment data to it. John Gamble : Those segments are also benefiting substantially just by record growth, right? So since records are up over 10% that drives their hit rates higher, so it's a direct benefit to those segments. Operator : The next question is coming from Andrew Nicholas of William Blair. Andrew Nicholas : I wanted to first ask on SSNs really good order. And I'm just curious if there's anything for us to read into that. It sounds like it was primarily batch. Is that kind of customers thinking about being more aggressive with marketing is that portfolio review? Just help me understand if there's anything to read into that strength? John Gamble : Sure. It was a very strong quarter. And stronger than we expect to see when we gave guidance part of it was because we signed -- we executed a couple of large transactions with new customers in the payments industry. And we think that's very important to us, not just in the fact that it delivered a strong quarter, but also because we think it's an ongoing revenue source, not just in batch but increasingly in our mind. So we're very excited about the fact that we signed those partnerships and delivered revenue in the quarter, but also we think it bodes very well for us across the payments industry as we continue to grow the use of our data in payments. Andrew Nicholas : So it doesn't sound like anything major sort of like a macro read-through perspective, more often? John Gamble : No, not a read through at all. It was really just great execution by the team on winning new customers and delivering in period. Andrew Nicholas : And then maybe changing gears a little bit on the mortgage business and the mortgage business within EWS in particular. If I heard you correct, John, you said you expect 16% growth in mortgage there in the fourth quarter on 6% growth in inquiries, 10% outperformance, certainly better than what you saw in the first half, but I think a little bit lower than what you had messaged earlier this year. So just curious about the puts and takes there, what if anything, has changed in terms of record growth relative to your expectations, pricing, new product development, anything like that, that would help bridge that gap? John Gamble : Look, I think the big thing we were talking about as we started the year, we were expecting very good progression in terms of the outperformance with EWS mortgage that would happen as we went through the year. And I think we saw it consistently every quarter. We saw improvements in second, third and now we would expect to be stronger in the fourth than we were in the third. So we feel very good about that progression. And again, it is driven by records. So record growth has been extremely strong. And given the partnerships that were signed this quarter, and I'm sure more they'll be signed in the fourth quarter. And then boarding those partnerships, we would expect to see very good record growth again next year. So I think overall, a really nice job by the team in driving that number back into the long-term framework that we expect, which is around 10%, right? That's kind of a level we talked about 10% to slightly above 10% as the long-term growth algorithm or the way we should outperform the mortgage market at EWS, and I think we're back to delivering in that level. Operator : The next question is coming from Faiza Alwy of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. We'll move on to the next question. Our next question is coming from Surinder Thind of Jefferies. Surinder Thind : Following up on the mortgage question here. Any color on how important the mix is in terms of the revenue recovery when we think about the $1.1 billion in terms of purchase versus refinance? Do we have to kind of get back to the historical average? Or are there other considerations that we should be thinking of? Mark Begor : Yes, that really assumes historical averages in that 2015 to '19 level. As you know, purchase is generally a very large part of the underlying market and it was in that 2015 to '19 level. That's super depressed now. As we pointed out, there's a lack of inventory. People are sitting on those lower interest rate loans and not upgrading from the condo to the three bedroom home with the yard that should. We believe that's going to loosen up and there'll be more activity on the purchase side. And then we should see both a combination of rate refi and cash-out refis as rates come down. We saw just that blip, I would call it, for a couple of weeks until the 10-year went up, where I think John mentioned in his comments that the bulk of that increase was rate refi. So you can see just a very small think about 20, 25, 30 basis points change, some consumers that had taken out mortgages, say, a year or two years ago, at higher rates, and now are looking at picking up that rate arbitrage. So there's clearly pent-up demand that as rates come down, gives us still a lot of confidence in the framework of that $1.1 billion plus of kind of tailwind in the mortgage market. And I think as John said in his comments, just as a reminder, we'll reset that number in February next year, but the $1.1 billion is based off today's pricing, meaning 2024, \u201824 product mix, \u201824 record hit rates. That will be a higher number likely when we get to 2025 and kind of reset what that opportunity is going forward in 25, 26, 27 as the market moves back with rate declines. Surinder Thind : And then as a follow-on to that I believe in the prepared comments, you mentioned that additional pricing benefits in 2025. And any color you can provide there in terms of the strength of the pricing benefits that you expect maybe next year relative to what we've got -- what we saw this year? Mark Begor : Yes, it's really early for that. We're not providing any '25 guidance. We tried to give you some kind of what we're seeing that we would expect to happen where we maybe have some confidence in it for next year. But I think it's too early on that. Just as a reminder, we will be doing increases on January 1. And we'll give some visibility to that when we have our February call and we laid out a framework for 2025, but you should expect price increases for EWS and from USIS as we've done over the last number of years. We think that there's a lot of value in the solutions we deliver. And you should expect and we plan to increase prices. Surinder Thind : Just as a clarification, I think is the commentary that you'll try and do pricing consistent with historical without talking about guidance. Is that the idea that pricing? Mark Begor : I think we're trying not to give any framework on what the level of pricing is, but just reinforcing that there will be price increases as this customary in our industry, given the value of the data we have. And we'll give you real clarity on that when we get to February and our 2025 guidance. Operator : The next question is coming from Kyle Peterson of Needham & Company. Kyle Peterson : Just wanted to see if you guys had any color I know on kind of some of the thoughts on purchase mortgage still being pretty subdued kind of partially due to rates and pursuing prices and affordability. Do you guys have any thoughts on how much rates would need to fall before purchase starts to improve? I know I know some of the inventory and home price issues are a little tougher to piece together. But at least on the rate side, I guess how much do you guys think rates need to fall before there would be some relief at least from that end of the market. Mark Begor : That's a tough one. As you know, we've never -- I'll say it in our lifetime, maybe it's a little shorter than that. But we haven't seen in 20 years a rate increase at this pace and at this level ever. So the shock of the where mortgage rates have gone from the, call it, super low levels during COVID timeframe to where they are today is unprecedented. So I think it's hard to correlate that back. I think what we saw in late August is just a great indicator of even a very small change in rates down, stimulated the market. In this case, our view principally in refi but there's clearly some purchase activity. There's purchase activity even at these higher rates. People are buying homes at either variable or a 30 year fix rates. It's just that there isn't a lot of inventory. The real question, I think, is when will it stimulate those that are, call it, 3% or 4% mortgages that want to upgrade to a larger home. That's a normal part of the housing economy. And when -- how -- what's the gap have to be from where they are today at call it 3% to 4% versus 6% plus, is it 50 bps? Is it 100 bps? It's clearly lower. And I think we'll see that as it goes forward, we'll be super transparent with you. But I think you should be encouraged that when rates come down, the market responds pretty quickly, which we saw in late September, yes. Kyle Peterson : And I guess just a follow-up on capital return. You guys can tease the potential for buybacks and dividends -- potential dividend increase in 2025. How do you guys think about priority and balanced between the two whether it's the firms you guys kind of want to do some of both. I know it's been a while since you guys have raised the dividend. But yes, just some more thoughts on how you guys are thinking about capital return and what the relative priority is? Mark Begor : Yes. And no change to how we've communicated since I've been here. We've always been working towards a goal to return cash to shareholders. And as you know, the last four, five years, we've invested really substantial parts of our excess free cash flow in CapEx with the cloud transformation, we're getting at the finish line on that. So that's really good news. And our CapEx is going to come down meaningfully, which will free up more cash for available to return to shareholders. We've also, as you know, as a part of our long-term framework, plan to continue a bolt-on M&A strategy, very disciplined on the financial returns and very disciplined around the strategic swim lanes that we're focused on, whether it's differentiated data, strengthening EWS or growing in identity and fraud. And I think as you know, we've done a sizable amount of bolt-on acquisitions, while we were doing the cloud. And we would expect to continue to do those bolt-ons. Most recently, we did Boa Vista last August. We're continuing to build a pipeline of strategic and financially attractive acquisitions, but we try to frame for you that we would expect over the long term to have 1 to 2 points of revenue growth from that bolt-on M&A. So you think about 1 to 2 points of revenue growth annually, that's $50 million to $100 million, Boa Vista delivered north of that. But in that kind of a range, and if you think about the cash required for buying the kind of companies that would be financially attractive to us that fit that $50 million to $100 million of revenue, obviously, at attractive margins and returns that's somewhere in the $500 million a year roughly of capital or cash bolt-on M&A. And your model, I'm sure looks like ours, when we get into 25,26, 27 our free cash flow really accelerates well in excess of what we would use for CapEx. It's 6% to 7%, that's south of $500 million. if you think about $500 million on the average, some years, it will be lower. Some years, it might be a bit higher on bolt-on M&A, there's substantial excess free cash flow to grow the dividend and buyback -- we've talked on the last call and we've talked, I think, on most of our earnings calls and when we're out with investors, when we think about returning cash to shareholders, we believe growing the dividend in a consistent way is a great way to return cash to shareholders and very disciplined. We frame that and this isn't -- we haven't made decisions, but we framed that in the direction of growing the dividend in line with our earnings growth. I think that's where we're working towards at the right time to do that. And then the excess free cash flow, which is meaningful, we would do in a buyback. And we'd be in the market kind of every day with that and use the buyback as another mechanism to return cash to shareholders. This has been our strategy since I joined Equifax is to complete the cloud transformation. We're getting towards that stage at 80% now and 90% by year-end and then bring CapEx down, bring our margins up off of the strong revenue growth rate we had that excess free cash flow to return to shareholders. And I think you caught in our comments earlier this morning, we shared with investors that we've added to our long-term framework structure, which is how we run the company and how we measure our teams a cash conversion metric. That's always been in our plan to do that. We thought it was the right time now to put that into our long-term framework. And I think it shows to you the discipline that we're going to have in running the company to generate that excess free cash flow to invest in Equifax, but as importantly to return cash to shareholders. And we look forward to getting to the stage to do that as we move into 2020. John Gamble : And just as a reminder, free cash flow is strengthening and very strong but also we're delevering. So we had to not only execute what Mark's talking about through free cash flow we generate, but also we'll have significant leverage available to us. given the substantial growth we're seeing in EBITDA. Operator : The next question is coming from Kevin McVeigh of UBS. Kevin McVeigh : I just want to circle back to the mortgage revenue opportunity. It's been pretty consistent in framing $1 billion plus, but that's based on kind of current pricing more to your point penetration and TWN records, things like that. if I go back, right, to kind of the '15 to '19 time period, you had 71 million records as opposed to 182 million today. So what I'm trying to understand is, is there any way to think about kind of what your yield is to get to that number today as opposed to what the inquiry or interest rate number has to be? So I guess said another way, you've got a lot more product and higher records, things like that. So do you need the same level of interest rate to kind of drive that revenue? Or is there any way to think about that aspect of it? Mark Begor : Yes, that's a tough one. We've worked hard to try to model that. It's just so unprecedented what's happened in the last three years with rates we've never seen it before. And we've picked you can agree or disagree with what we've been using, but we pick 2015 to '19 as being a normal level. But if you go back like a decade, go back the last time there was really a kind of an unusual mortgage environment was '07, '08, '09 during the global financial crisis, and that was more an underwriting crisis from a consumer mortgage standpoint versus a rate on. And I think it's just -- it's been very consistent. There's just so much scale in the United States of consumers that want to move from an apartment to that first condo that apartment to a home. They want to upgrade their home and then there's a flip side when consumers age out and they start retiring, they sell their big home, they buy a smaller home on the mortgages with all that. So it's just such a large market, and we've never seen a 50% decline. So we've tried to just lay out that's the anomaly in the market. Our view is that as rates come down, we'll move into that $1.2 billion of market opportunity, as we pointed out, will be a larger number next year. And we're just convinced that it's going to happen over time, which will be additive to our P&L and our framework. In our long-term framework, of 8% to 12% revenue growth, we really just have GDP in there. And think about a couple of points of market expansion underlies our 8% to 12%. And we've also been very clear that there's going to be very high incremental margins as that mortgage market comes back, meaning we're not going to reinvest those dollars in more people. We have the right cost structure in Equifax today grow our business and really to make the right investments. So as that market tailwind flows into our P&L, we would expect it to be incremental, which obviously will drive our top line but also our margins and our free cash flow and give us more free cash to return to shareholders. Kevin McVeigh : And then just real quick on the ERTC, ERC rather. What percentage of the revenue was at today? And where was that? Maybe at peak? Just trying to dimensionalize what that headwind has been? Mark Begor : John can jump in on that. Equifax quite small, but in the employer vertical, it was a large number and now it's going down to nothing. John Gamble : But you can just give you orders of magnitude right now, ERC is think on the order of $1 million a quarter. And it was probably in the order of 10-ish, maybe a little higher $1 million per quarter as you go back two and three quarters, right, even the third quarter last year. So that's the type of change you're talking about. And in an employer business that's $95 million a quarter. Obviously, that can be a significant change. Operator : The next question is coming from Scott Wurtzel of Wolfe Research. Scott Wurtzel : Just wanted to ask on the government vertical. I know we've talked about sort of the penetration story in terms of the amount of state local federal agencies that are out there. But I guess I would love to kind of hear your thoughts on when we look at sort of the different buckets of benefits of security, SNAP, ACA, Medicaid like where you kind of see most sort of white space for penetration over the near to medium-term here? Mark Begor : Yes, it's a great question. Thanks for bringing it up. A 29% growth, you're the first analysts to bring up that vertical. So we appreciate that. And as a reminder, government is moving to be our largest vertical in Workforce Solutions. And as you know, you've got that large $5 billion TAM against around a little bit, roughly an $800 million run rate business now. I wouldn't think about specific services. I'd really think about the TAM itself and the biggest opportunity in the TAM is penetration at the states and the state agencies. An agency deploys typically not a state. And if you think about, call it, $800 million versus $5 billion that $4 billion plus of potential revenue for us in the government vertical, are social service verifications that are still being done manually. So that's really the focus. We've been adding resources and people. We're investing in new products and technology to enable our ability to penetrate those states. There's -- when you meet with a director of an agency at a state there's -- they all want to use it because it's accurate. It adds productivity to them. They're always challenged with how do we deliver the specific services, whether it's food stamps or health support how do we deliver that more quickly. And as you know, the federal government that pays for the bulk of those social services requires the states to verify eligibility. And that's where we come in, eligibility is around income and verifying the source of that income, which is the employment. So for us, the big opportunity is really at the state level. As you now know, we have some large federal contracts. Last year, we extended our CMS contract, which was a big $1 billion plus contract extension. We announced \u2013 we shared in this call that we just extended our SSA contract, which is $500 million over five years. So you see the scale of those federal contracts. But the opportunity to continue to drive that strong double-digit growth in government going forward is really penetration in the states. That's the bulk of that $4 billion untapped TAM. And as I said, more people more feet on the street. We have Equifax people, Workforce Solutions people that live at the state capitals that work with each of those agencies. We're working with partners. We're adding on new products. As you know, we have more data now incarceration data from our APRs Insights acquisitions is used in that vertical. We're working to put those data elements together in a single transaction. Today, they're all delivered individually. So there's just a lot of opportunities and the scale of the workforce allows us to invest in that. And I think as we said, in many calls that we expect the government vertical over the long-term to outgrow the 13% to 15% growth in Workforce Solutions. We just think there's so much opportunity for us because of the value it delivers at all of the agencies at the state level. Scott Wurtzel : And just as a follow-up on the mortgage side. I guess when looking at some industry data, it looks like maybe the gap between sort of USIS mortgage inquiries versus some of the application data in terms of kind of maybe widened during the quarter. I'm just wondering if there were anything to sort of call out with that? Was it due to maybe mix dynamics between purchase and refi? Any information on that would be helpful. John Gamble : No, I don't think there's anything specific, right? I think it continues to be. We still think we have the same penetration and share that we have consistently. Obviously, with hard inquiries, it's still required to pull a tribunal. So I'm not sure what you're specifically looking at, but no, we don't see any changes that are meaningful in hard inquiries in the industry. Mark Begor : And I think as you saw, we expected that to happen. We told you in July, we thought it would happen, but you saw the outperformance from record growth that really moved up positively in EWS. So that's -- we were pleased with that. John Gamble : Pre-quals continues to be a big part of our business. And obviously, that's something that is shared amongst the three players. So sure could move between those. But overall, we're happy with the way the business is performing. Operator : The next question is coming from Jason Haas of Wells Fargo. Jason Haas : Maybe sort going back to talent verifications. I'm curious if you have any insight into which industries you're seeing that slowdown in hiring. Then I'm also curious if you're seeing any increase in competition or any more in-sourcing by some of the large background screeners. Mark Begor : Yes. I think we -- what we heard from the background screening customer base that we have is that they saw some slowdowns kind of in mid late September in white-collar. Even though we had a good quarter, there were some slowdowns there. So we took that run rate rolling forward. And I think you've seen enough layoffs over the last announcements over the last month or two from different companies that perhaps tightening up, you're waiting to see where the election goes and what's going to happen in Washington. So I don't think it's anything different than that, John. John Gamble : No. And we haven't really seen any movements in share. We continue to work well with our partners, and we just think it's a matter of we happen to be focused in white-collar and you've seen some slowdown in white-collar specifically in September. Jason Haas : And then as a follow-up question, I was curious if we look at the EWS mortgage increase versus USIS, they're still under pacing. My understanding is that the function of people shopping around by not closing. So I'm curious what's your expectation for when that gap closes looks like what you said maybe probably a little bit of a narrower in fourth quarter. Does that -- do you expect that would converge in next year, sometime next year? Mark Begor : We actually don't. If you go back to really in history, there's always been more mortgage pulls for the credit file than income and employment. On average, we get five plus credit file polls, a closed loan, where there's two to three income and employment pulls per closed loan. So that hasn't changed. We don't expect that to change. What did change as rates went up, was there was a consumer behavior of just more shopping to try to find another 25 bps off on the loan, meaning they're going to multiple mortgage originators for either their refi or for their purchase loan and every time they go to a different originator, there's a credit file fold. That's a shopping process because the originator wants to figure out is someone that has the credit score that would support the kind of loan they're going to pull. They typically don't pull income and employment there. Now we're trying to innovate to help that shopping process. And I think you heard us talk earlier on this call in July also. That we're piloting in the marketplace in Equifax credit file with an income and employment flag on it to really indicate that this consumer not only has this credit score, but they also are working today, you don't know that in the shopping process if you're an originator. We think that should advantage our credit file, which should drive some credit file share. And in the shopping process, where three credit reports are universally pulled in the application process in shopping, many originators pull three, some pull two, simple one. So we want to differentiate ourselves in the shopping process on the credit file side. But no, we don't expect them to converge. And as John said earlier, I think on an earlier question, they've been fairly consistent in '24 and '23. John Gamble : Earlier this year, we had thought perhaps shopping might start to slow. And when we gave guidance back in February, what we indicated that we thought we might see that start to narrow or shopping might slow or said another way, the percentage of applications that are initiated would actually result in a loan but we just haven't seen it happen, right? And so the pattern that we've seen over the past two to three years just continues to occur. And so I think as Mark said, we -- at this point, our expectation is it will just continue to occur. Operator : The next question is coming from Jeff Meuler of Baird. Jeff Meuler : I just want to circle back to the Q4 guidance. I get it, $15 million is not that great in the grand scale of Equifax. But if I also consider the 9 point better mortgage market assumption, which impacts almost 20% of your revenue run rate, it does seem like a fairly sizable adjustment. So just, I guess, any other callouts of size beyond the industry gross hiring volumes? And maybe if I could just hit it head on, like, was there any sort of sizable client loss or meaningful reduction in client relationships that also contribute just so we don't have to wonder about. Mark Begor : Yes, you don't have to wonder about that. Go ahead, John, and I'll jump into. John Gamble : First, on mortgage, right? The difference in the -- change in guide in the implied guide in the fourth quarter from back in July to the actual guide now, the change in mortgage isn't very substantial at all, right? What you're talking about is credit inquiries. I'm not quite sure it's 9 points. I think that's an estimate that you're providing. But yes, credit increase are slightly stronger and that's making USIS revenue slightly stronger, but that read through for the question we just got doesn't really apply to EWS because of the fact that what we're seeing is shopping behavior not closing behavior. So the impact on our mortgage revenue between the guidance we provided in October and the implied guide back from July is really relatively small, right? So that's why what we're talking about here is specifically related to non-mortgage revenue. And as Mark said in his remarks and I reiterated the biggest trucker is employer, right? And also, there is some impact from talent because we saw weakness in talent in September that we carried through in our run rates in terms of our guidance. But the biggest driver is employer and that's really the driver, but mortgage wasn't a substantial improvement in the guidance in October relative to the expectations in July. Jeff Meuler : And then sorry to get the weeds on this. I get the typical methodology in terms of run rating forward recent mortgage. But just given the volatility in the last few weeks, I want to know what period specifically you're run rating forward because you're calling out the late September improvement. And then I think you said subsequently it reduced back to maybe like July, August levels in October. So just what period are you extrapolating forward given the recent. Mark Begor : Yes, Jeff, no change in how we do it. We always do it through like early this week, right? So we're kind of in the mid-October. So this is no change from last quarter to the quarter before that, whether it's mortgage or any other parts of our business. But to your point, mortgage or in this case, we saw the hiring impact late in September that continued in October, same with the impact of mortgage. So we try to use the most current run rates we typically use the last -- we'll look at how is it the last week. How is it the last two weeks, how is it the last three weeks, four weeks, something like that and try to see where are those trends? Is it stronger in the last week than the last weeks. Is it weaker in the last week and try to put that together and use our best estimate around where that -- we think that trend is and use that for the current quarter guidance. That's no change, right? John. John Gamble : No change at all. What we've seen in October, right, is obviously inquiries came down and they kind of stabilized in October, right? So that's kind of the basis that we're using going forward. Operator : The next question is coming from Owen Lau of Oppenheimer. Owen Lau : Could you please add more color on insurance and commercial vertical? It grew double-digit and looks pretty strong there. What are you seeing there? Mark Begor : Yes. John, you can jump in, too. So the commercial vertical is our small business -- data business that is had -- if you look at '22 and '23, actually '21, '22 and '23, that business was up very strong, high singles and for many quarters, double digit. We had some execution issues earlier this year, but it's not back to that similar levels, which we're really pleased with. We would expect that business to grow at the high end of the USIS 6 to 8 range over the long term because of the unique data that we have. And remember, we made the PayNet acquisition with the leasing trade lines. We're onboarding now merchant data to enhance the picture around small businesses and obviously bringing in the entrepreneur from our consumer data set. So we think that's a business that will continue to have positive growth going forward, and we're pleased to see it back in that range where we expect it to be. John Gamble : Insurance for us is relatively small in the broader scheme of USIS, but we did see nice growth, and it was principally online. So we just saw higher online transaction volume across the insurance vertical. Owen Lau : And then going back to your cloud migration, could you please give us an update on how we should think about incremental top line revenue contribution in 2025 and maybe 26%. Any time line of product launches you can share over the next few quarters or so? Mark Begor : Yes. We talked earlier, you're seeing already some of the impacts of the cloud transformation. If you go back, our long-term framework for Vitality is 10%. We increased it from 5 to 7 pre-cloud. We've been delivering north of that 10% for the last couple of years, including in 2020 4. As you know, we increased the guide for this year. And we think that's directly attributable to our cloud investments, the benefits from the cloud investments are focused on innovation products as well as our focus on AI. So that innovation, we think, is a very good metric around the benefits of cloud. We think we'll also see share gains in USIS in some of our international markets as we complete the cloud and deliver always on stability and move into either secondary or primary positions when we're below that today. So that should get into the P&L. And specifically, I think maybe your question is around USIS since we talked about the USIS cloud completion. We would expect their vitality, which has been increasing this year from 8% in third quarter -- second quarter into 9% and the third, you had to move towards that $10 million. And we would expect to allow them to deliver solidly inside of that 6% to 8% long-term framework going forward. Operator : The next question is coming from Craig Huber of Huber Research Partners. Craig Huber : You talked about a long-term outlook for your vitality index at 10%. I think you said you're 11% right now. Can you give us some examples that you're quite positive with new products out there today, but particularly outside the U.S., I'd like to hear something you have already touched on today. That's my first question. Mark Begor : Yes. That's a -- there's a lot of them. I guess you're asking me to tell you something we're excited. But I think broadly, you should be excited and we are too about vitality. International vitality is still below 10%, but I think it was 9% in the quarter. So very, very strong. We would expect them to move towards that trend, as they complete cloud like in Canada in some of the other markets. So that's a real positive. We've got some identity solutions in the marketplace internationally and in the U.S. that we're excited about, some new solutions using alternative data that it has real traction that adds to the credit file that we think are quite positive. We talked about earlier on this call, some of the solutions we're doing here in the U.S. between EWS and USIS that are really unique that we think will benefit both USIS and EWS using the income flag on some of our credit files, which we think is very positive. We've rolled out in the U.S. someone score solutions that combine our cell phone utility data as well as our other alternative data that's having big lifts in performance. It differentiates really our score using our credit file and other alternative data versus our competitors. So we're excited about that. Did you add anything, John? John Gamble : I think we have some USIS solutions on the FMS side where we have customers usually Ignite to generate analytics that they can use to improve marketing campaigns and conversion, all of those driven by fabric. Craig Huber : My other question, if I could. When you think about costs for next year, I know you want to give formal guidance at this stage when we think about costs for next year given all the cost savings initiatives you guys have put in place here. You're going to be at 90% through the cloud transformation at the end of this year. And so for the cost next year that you guys can control and assuming the economy holds together, mortgage rates come down as you're talking about and stuff. I'm assuming you have a very strong flow-through down to the EBITDA line if you have strong revenue growth here. But I'm curious on your cost side, do you have to step up any investment spending next year? I mean how should we just broadly think about your cost outlook for next year in your two main segments? Mark Begor : I think you saw we took a charge this quarter that was planned to execute the cloud cost savings, principally from USIS and some of that from Canada that will benefit the fourth quarter, but that also benefits 2025. So that benefit is a positive. As you point out, we're at 90% cloud complete, which is a big milestone at year-end but we still have 10% to go. So as we complete those last pieces of the cloud, there'll be additional decommissioning of the legacy infrastructure for that tail of our cloud completion. So that's going to benefit '25 and '26. And John, you also not cost, but it's -- depreciation, you talked about being higher next year because we're bringing on more of the new platforms into our operating mode and starting to depreciate those. So we framed for you that depreciation will be up next year. But I think you said it's -- we're kind of peaking in depreciation in 2025 with CapEx coming down. John Gamble : And in terms of -- you mentioned investment, right? So investment is actually coming down on capital. So we've talked about the fact that we're moving down substantially on capital spending in 2024 versus 2023. You'll probably see us continue to drive down as a percentage of revenue, our capital spending in 2025 relative to 2024 as we move toward our 6% to 7% long-term framework. And as you know, investment spend in terms of capital expense move together. So we don't see an increase in investment spend that would be expense because we're continuing to bring down our investments and spend as capital. Operator : The next question is coming from Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Toni Kaplan : My first question actually picks up on the last part of the last one. You mentioned the 6% to 7% CapEx in the long-term framework. This year, obviously, a really big move with USIS going on to the cloud there. So a lot of I imagine a lot of spend being spent on that. So I guess, should we see a big step down in '21 on the CapEx side or should we expect the move towards the 6% to 7% to be more gradual since you still have 10% of revenue left and maybe there are some other things that you're working on? And maybe just a follow-up, what's the next step in the technology plan from here now that you have most of this done. Mark Begor : Yes. So a couple of different questions there, Tony. First, we're not intending to give '25 guidance this year, but we're happy to give some kind of indication. So I think we said we expect CapEx to come down next year again. You use the term big -- it's hard to find big. You may think about differently than I do, but CapEx, we will bring CapEx down next year as we move closer to cloud completion. What's left to be done is outside the U.S., principally Australia, a few Latin American countries. We're partially through on U.K. We'll finish a lot of the U.K. next year. Spain will be done by year-end. So it's really those kind of elements so you should expect to see a reduction in CapEx as a percent of revenue again in 2016, as we get kind of that next stage. We framed the 6% to 7% over the long-term is what we expect to do. And as a reminder, as we move into kind of a post cloud environment, that CapEx is increasingly used for innovation in new products versus cloud transformation or maintaining legacy infrastructure. So we think we're going to be advantaged in having what I would call growth as we move into '25, '26, '27 versus kind of building cloud CapEx we've had for the last number of years, which we think will be a positive. John Gamble : In terms of the benefit to cash conversion, I think certainly as we get into 2026, you're going to see depreciation probably likely be higher than capital spending. So again, helps cash conversion significantly. Toni Kaplan : And this one sort of touched on a few times, but just hoping you could give any sort of update on like green shoots that will make you more optimistic in the consumer credit environment about 2025, if you're seeing any, if you're not, that's fine, too. But just anything that makes you more or less optimistic about 2025 with regard to consumer credit? Mark Begor : I think we talked about consumer credit, some end market consumer demand softening like in auto, but it's still okay. It's not like it's depressed. You go back to two years ago, we had the fintech kind of was really impacted. That's now normalized, I think it's a positive, meaning and we're growing in fintech. So as we -- with cloud and new products going forward. So when I think about green shoots, from where we sit, 2025 feels like certainly the first half of '25 going to be much like we're seeing today. I think the green shoot really would be in rate reductions. We talk a ton around the impact of rate reductions in mortgage, but rate reductions in auto for auto loans are going to be helpful to that end market, in my view, and in P loan, lesser degree in cards, consumers tend to be less sensitive to rates and cards because most consumers don't think they're going to revolve with a credit card. But when you're taking out a P loan, you're taking out an installment loan when you're buying a car on credit and those rates are higher, too. So if there is any potential green shoots that we haven't seen yet, is does the Fed take rates down? Does the 10-year come down? And does that not only benefit mortgage but also benefit a couple of the other end-user markets. Operator : Our next question is coming from Ashish Sabadra of RBC Capital Markets. Ashish Sabadra : I have two clarifying questions. First one was on that $70 million savings in 2025 from cost actions. Just wondering, is that all OpEx? Or does it also have CapEx saving and does that include all the cloud savings? So that's my first question. John Gamble : Yes. So the $70 million is total spending savings, so it would have some CapEx as well. Ashish Sabadra : That's helpful color. And then maybe just a clarification on the inquiries for 2025 expectation for a 5% growth. I was just wondering, is that largely just based on as Mark explained, the near-term dynamic? Or are you also baking in the Fed rate cuts going in 2025 or those could be incremental upside? John Gamble : Yes. So we weren't trying to give that as an expectation for 2025. We were just trying to provide it as a piece of information. But if you take the current run rate we're seeing now in the first half of October, and you just assume that they don't really change and then apply seasonality to them for 2025 that we would end up with inventories up something over 5% in 2025 and inquiry something up over 5% in the first quarter. We weren't trying to indicate that was guidance from us in any way. We were just trying to give people perspective on what the current run rates would look like. We know you and many investors have their own perspectives on what the mortgage market is going to do and how it will change over the rest of the year. And we weren't trying to indicate we expect it to be flat. It's just -- that's where it is right now. Mark Begor : And we don't forecast rate changes. We never have. We try to find for you what the impact of a potential rate change could be like in mortgage, but we don't forecast rate changes. That's just not our guidance philosophy. Operator : The next question is coming from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. George Tong : Mark, can you talk a bit more about what you're seeing broadly with consumer credit health, particularly across prime and subprime consumers, data seems to suggest that delinquency rates are continuing to go up year-over-year across lending categories. Mark Begor : Yes. I think it's still, in our view, a pretty good market. That's what our customers are saying. There's -- I don't think there's any alarm, George from our customers around where delinquencies have gone. I think most of our customers believe with the low unemployment or high employment rates, meaning consumers working that even with delinquencies up that's manageable and they're generally at delinquency rates that are inside of how our customers think about growing their business. So we haven't seen that impact -- we haven't seen delinquencies be a reason that people are tightening up outside of subprime. Subprime that's already happened. Subprime tightened up a couple of years ago. But from our perspective, if employment is going to stay at this fairly low level, we don't see that impacting our volumes in the fourth quarter in the early parts of 2025 unless there's a change in the employment levels -- and unemployment goes up. George Tong : And then, John, can you talk about the puts and takes with your updated EBITDA margin outlook for the year, 32.4% at the midpoint compared to 32.6% previously. John Gamble : Yes. So obviously, we gave our revised guidance for the full year. We gave a for the first time for the fourth quarter. And I think what you're just seeing is the -- is a very strong improvement in EBITDA margin in 4Q versus 3Q, which we're very happy with, a 4Q adjusted EPS and an EBITDA dollar level, which are at record levels, as we said in the call, and Marc reiterated over $500 million in EBITDA in the fourth quarter. So I think what you're seeing is very strong delivery in the fourth quarter. A lot of the improvement in EBITDA driven by cost reductions and actions that are being taken now that we've completed cloud transformation -- sorry, customer migrations on the consumer side in USIS and then obviously, Canada as well. So we feel good about the improvements we're talking about, about the higher margins we're talking about in the fourth quarter and we think that bodes well for next year. Operator : The next question is coming from Andrew Stein of FT Partners. Andrew Stein : So my first question, I just wanted to shift to the international segment. I realize the Boa Vista acquisition lapped its one year marker in , I guess, and LATAM had a really strong quarter. So can you help us understand the run rate organic growth trends between Boa Vista and LATAM ex Brazil? And then what is Boa Vista\u2019s market share now compared to the 15% at the time of acquisition. I'm just wondering what opportunities you have to gain market share over the next year. Mark Begor : Yes. So we're still excited -- very excited about Boa Vista. As you know, we just lapped the one year mark of ownership of the business. We're still in the thick of integrating the business and bringing our new products and technology down there. Serasa Experian has a very strong business that they've executed very well on. But the feedback we're getting from all the big banks and customers there is that they welcome a global competitor and that's where we're going to. We're pleased with the performance of Boa Vista through 2024, and we expect it to be continued strong and we do expect some share gains going forward. It's too early to see that in the business after just 12 months. And we haven't really fully deployed a lot of the Equifax technology of Ignite and interconnect, but those are getting in place as we exit the year and into 2025. So we'd expect some more traction there going forward. Latin America had a very good quarter. We're performing well in that market, really in all geographies, all the countries that we participate in and really big focus by that team as well as the international team on innovation and new products, which is really helping their effectiveness in the marketplace. Andrew Stein : And then just a follow-up on the international margin expansion. That was also a really strong this quarter. And just wondering if you could help us understand the remaining potential for margin expansion in LATAM and Europe as the cloud transformation is completed for those segments? John Gamble : Yes. We're expecting, obviously, very good margin expansion again in the fourth quarter. And then we're expecting them to continue to grow margins as we get into 2025. Part of it obviously driven by continued good revenue growth, organic revenue growth in international with again very high variable margins. And they do -- and we do have more opportunities, as Mark talked about, because we're completing cloud transformation in the U.K. in 2025. You'll see it more in Australia, New Zealand in terms of 2026 and pieces as we go through 2025 in Latin America. So we expect to see that be beneficial to margins in Latin America as we go through 2025. But again, just a general trend of improving margins in LATAM -- sorry, in international as we look over the next several years. Mark Begor : And John, we also -- we just completed Canada two weeks ago or 10 days ago. So those benefits will roll into the fourth quarter and into 2025 and then we complete Spain later this year in a couple of other Latin American countries. So that cloud completion, as you point out, which is principally that 10% we have left to go is going to benefit principally international because that's where the work of the cloud complete is going to take place. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Burns for closing comments. Trevor Burns : Yes. Thanks, everybody, for your time today and if you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to myself or Molly and look forward to interacting with everybody throughout the quarter. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's event. You may disconnect your lines or log off webcast at this time and enjoy the rest of your day.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Trevor Burns, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Investor Relations. Trevor, you may now begin. Trevor Burns : Thanks and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Trevor Burns. With me today are Mark Begor, our Chief Executive Officer, and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the IR Calendar section of the News and Events tab at our Investor Relations website. During the call, we will be making reference to certain materials that can also be found in the Presentations section of the News and Events tab at our IR website. These materials are also labeled for 4Q, 2024 earnings conference call, Also, we're making certain forward-looking statements, including first quarter and full year 2025 guidance, to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results that differ materially from our expectations. Several risk factors that may impact our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2023 form 10-K and subsequent filings. We will also be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, and cash conversion, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and can be found in the Financial Results section of the Financial Info tab at our IR website. As a note, based on feedback from many of you, starting with our first quarter call on April, we will plan on shortening our prepared remarks. Some of the content that we normally share in the prepared remarks may be included in the appendix to our quarterly earnings presentations. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to share them with me and Molly. Now I would like to turn it over to Mark. Mark Begor : Before I cover our results for the quarter, I wanted to spend a few minutes on our 2024 performance. Turning to Slide 4, we were pleased with our financial performance in 2024 that was in line with the goals we set at the beginning of the year against some challenging mortgage and hiring macros. 2024 revenue was up almost 8% on a reported and organic constant currency basis at the low end of our long-term 8% to 12% growth framework. Adjusted EPS was $7.29 per share, up over 8.5% versus last year. Cash conversion was 89%, approaching our target of 95%-plus, with free cash flow of $813 million, up 58%, and reduced our debt leverage to our target levels of under three turns. We delivered accelerated improvement in constant dollar revenue growth at almost 10% and EBITDA margins at over 34% in the second half of the year, although not at the levels we had planned given market headwinds, principally in U.S. hiring and the mortgage market. Overall, 2024 performance was strong, aligned with our EFX 2027 strategic priorities, and was an important inflection point in our ability to accelerate our free cash flow generation that sets us up well to drive growth through targeted bolt-on acquisitions while positioning Equifax to return capital to shareholders through both dividend growth and launching a multiyear share repurchase program in 2025. We delivered against our EFX 2027 strategic priorities. We made strong progress towards completing our cloud data and technology transformation as USIS, Canada, Spain, Chile, and several other Latin American countries completed their consumer cloud customer migrations, a huge milestone for Equifax. We now have close to 85% of Equifax revenue in the new Equifax cloud, which is a big accomplishment after five years of investment. We expect to have a significant competitive advantage as we pivot from building to leveraging the Equifax cloud in 2025 and beyond that will allow us to fully focus on growth, innovation, new products, and AI. Our cloud progress allowed us to decommission legacy systems and data centers and deliver about $300 million in spending reductions last year that increased to about $360 million in 2025. Leveraging the new Equifax cloud, we are now on offense with EFX.AI. In 2024, 95% of our new models and scores were built using Equifax AI and machine learning, up from 70% in 2023. In 2024, the EWS team had another outstanding year of record additions, ending the year with 188 million active records of 20 million records, or 12%, with 734 million total records in the TWN dataset. The team signed 15 new strategic partnerships in 2024, including Workday, which we expect will fuel EWS verification services revenue growth in 2025 and beyond. And we continued our strong new product growth with broad-based 2024 Vitality Index of 12%, which was 200 basis points above our long-term 10% goal and equates to about 650 million of new product revenue last year. Our Vitality Index in EWS and international were very strong, and importantly, we saw USIS Vitality Index strengthen 200 basis points from the first half to the second half of last year. We expect our Vitality Index to be above our long-term goal of 10% again in 2025 as we leverage the Equifax cloud to deliver new products that only Equifax can provide. As we move into 2025, I'm energized by our commercial momentum, new product, innovation, and AI capabilities, and the benefits of the new Equifax cloud. Turning to Slide 5, Equifax's fourth quarter reported revenue of $1.419 billion was up 7%. The dollar strengthened substantially in the quarter, negatively impacting revenue about $12 million versus our October guidance. On an organic constant currency basis, revenue growth of 9% was just over 100 basis points, or $17 million, below the midpoint of our October framework, driven principally by weaker U.S. hiring and mortgage markets, which declined significantly in the last half of the fourth quarter. The weaker U.S. hiring markets impacted our talent and onboarding businesses, driving the bulk of the weakness versus our guidance midpoint. This resulted in non-mortgage constant dollar revenue growth being just under 6% in the quarter and about 150 basis points weaker than our expectations. Total U.S. mortgage revenue was up 29% in the quarter and also below our expectations. U.S. mortgage revenue declined meaningfully in late December and January as mortgage rates have moved above 7%. Based on these trends, we expect 2025 mortgage revenue credit inquiries to be down 12% in 2025. Despite the pressure from weaker mortgage and hiring macros, Equifax delivered fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $502 million, which was up about $30 million sequentially with adjusted EBITDA margin of 35.4% in line with our October framework. And this is the first quarter in Equifax's history of adjusted EBITDA over $500 million, a big milestone for the future. Adjusted EPS of $2.12 per share was at the midpoint of our October guidance and was the first quarter of adjusted EPS over $2 a share since the second quarter of 2022. We were disappointed that we were below October revenue guidance for fourth quarter revenue given the mortgage and hiring declines late in the quarter. However, the team performed well in managing costs and expenses to deliver on our commitments on both adjusted EBITDA and EPS. We remain focused on delivering on our commitments and have no change in our Equifax long-term growth framework. Turning to Slide 6, workforce solutions revenue was up 7% in the quarter and below our October guidance principally due to lower than expected talent solutions and I-9 and onboarding revenue from the weaker hiring market. Talent solutions revenue was up 2% in the quarter. In October, we discussed declining trends in hiring volume that weakened meaningfully during the fourth quarter. And in January, we saw further weakening of monthly hiring volumes off the lower December levels. Despite the weaker hiring macro, talent solutions continues to outperform their underlying markets, benefiting from new records, new products, penetration, and pricing, as well as new solutions from the new total verified data hub, which includes trended employment data, as well as incarceration, education, and licensing and credentialing data. Government had another strong quarter with revenue up 11% and consistent with our expectations. As expected, growth rates in the fourth quarter were lower than the third quarter, principally due to copping off very strong growth we saw last year from redetermination volumes. We saw continued strong momentum in incarceration data sales in the fourth quarter, with insights revenue up double digits. EWS mortgage revenue was up 17% in the quarter, with TWN inquiries up 6%. EWS total mortgage revenue outperformed TWN inquiries by 11%, up about 150 basis points sequentially from strong record growth in the fourth quarter. Employer services revenue was down 9% in the quarter. The weaker hiring market also negatively impacted I-9 and onboarding revenue. As I referenced earlier, the weak hiring market has continued in January, and we expect it to impact first quarter performance. Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margins of 51.9% were up a strong 70 basis points and consistent with our guidance, despite the weaker than expected revenue growth. The EWS team continues to tightly manage costs while staying focused on driving top-line growth. Turning to slide 7, TWN record additions continue to be very strong again in the fourth quarter, with active records up 6 million in the quarter and 20 million for the year, or 12% to 188 million records. In the fourth quarter, EWS signed agreements with three new strategic partners, which brings the total new partnerships in 2024 to 15. We expect these new partnerships, along with our new Workday Partnership, to drive record growth and EWS revenue growth in 2025. At 137 million unique active records, we have plenty of room to grow the TWN database towards the TAM of about 225 million income-producing Americans. Turning to Slide 8, USIS revenue was up over 10% in the quarter, driven by strong mortgage outperformance, which was consistent with our guidance and well above the USIS long-term revenue growth framework of 6% to 8%. USIS non-mortgage revenue grew almost 2.5% in the quarter and was slightly below our guidance. Within online, we saw mid-single-digit growth in FI, which was an improving trend, low single-digit growth in auto, and a return to growth in our direct-to-consumer business, the segment where we principally sell data to the other credit bureaus. Telco declined in the quarter, comping off a very strong fourth quarter last year, and we saw declines in identity and fraud principally from our chargeback management business. USIS mortgage revenue was up a very strong 47%. Mortgage credit inquiries were flat during the quarter, but we saw them weaken late in the quarter and decline meaningfully sequentially in December as rates moved above 7%. The strong pricing environment, along with growth in mortgage pre-approval and prequalification products, drove the mortgage revenue growth. In the fourth quarter, mortgage pre-approval and prequalification inquiries declined sequentially. At about $115 million, USIS mortgage revenue was just over 24% of total USIS revenue in the quarter. Financial marketing services, our B2B offline business, was about flat in the quarter and in line with our October guidance. We saw strength in our identity-based businesses and with our expanding relationships in the payments segment. Our IXI wealth data revenue was down in the quarter, comping against a very strong fourth quarter in 2023. USIS consumer solutions D2C business had another very strong quarter, up 9%, with strong growth in our consumer direct channel from strong customer acquisition trends. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 38.3% in the quarter, up 440 basis points sequentially and consistent with our guidance. USIS performed extremely well in delivering expected cloud cost reductions as they decommissioned legacy consumer, telco, and utility technology platforms. With the USIS consumer and our telco and utilities cloud transformations complete, the USIS team is positioned well for growth in 2025 and beyond. Turning to Slide 9, international revenue was up a strong 11% in constant currency and above their 7% to 9% long-term revenue framework and stronger than our October guidance. Latin American growth was very strong, driven by double-digit growth in Brazil. Canada and Australia delivered higher growth rates sequentially, and Europe grew mid-single digits in the fourth quarter, which was sequentially weaker in the UK CRA, reflecting overall UK economic conditions. International adjusted EBITDA margins of 32.5% were stronger than our October guidance, up 480 basis points sequentially and the highest since the fourth quarter of 2020 from strong revenue growth and good cost execution. Turning to Slide 10, we continue to make very strong progress driving innovation new products covering a 12% vitality in the fourth quarter from broad-based double-digit performances across all of our businesses. We expect strong Equifax double-digit vitality index again in 2025, above our 10% long-term goal, leveraging our Equifax cloud capabilities to drive product roll-ups using our differentiated data and EFX.AI capabilities. With our USIS consumer and telco customer migrations complete, we are rapidly developing and bringing to market new solutions that include our unique TWN income and employment data, along with our USIS credit and alternative data assets. We expect our TWN-powered credit solutions to help our clients gain deeper insights into consumer creditworthiness from solutions using both credit and TWN income and employment indicators, which is a big win for our clients, for consumers, and Equifax. We're rolling out a new solution that provides mortgage lenders key TWN income and employment information along with the Equifax credit report. This new solution allows lenders to instantly obtain information about both a mortgage applicant's creditworthiness and the applicant's employment status with a single data request from Equifax, a huge differentiator leveraging the power of our unique EWS and USIS data assets that are in the Equifax single data cloud fabric. We plan to launch additional only Equifax solutions in 2025 for the auto vertical, where both credit and income verifications are integral to credit underwriting. Moving to Slide 11, we enter 2025, executing well against our Equifax 2027 strategic priorities and we're well-positioned to deliver continued strong AI-powered new product growth, leveraging new Equifax cloud that will drive our top-line growth. 2025 is a pivotal year for Equifax in our ability to accelerate our free cash flow generation as CapEx comes down and our EBITDA expands. Our strong free cash flow conversion that will approach our 95% long-term goal and leverage our expanding EBITDA positions Equifax to return capital to shareholders through both growing our dividend and launching a multiyear share repurchase program in 2025. We are continuing to face challenging end markets in U.S. mortgage and hiring. With mortgage rates above 7%, we have seen meaningful declines in hard mortgage inquiries over the past six weeks. Based on those trends, our 2025 guidance reflects USIS hard credit inquiries declining 12% compared to last year. We will continue to forecast our mortgage revenue off current EFX credit and TWN inquiry run rates and, as in the past, we do not include interest rate decreases or increases in our forecast. For perspective, the USIS hard credit inquiries that we disclose quarterly represent over 70% of total USIS mortgage revenue in 2024. Also, based on weak hiring trends over the past eight weeks, we expect 2025 U.S. hiring to be down about 8% relative to 2024 and out of the order of over 10% below average BLS hires over the last 10 years. And last, with the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly over the past three months and at current FX rates, 2025 revenue will be negatively impacted by about 130 basis points or about $75 million. Based on these economic assumptions, we expect to deliver 2025 revenue of about $5.95 billion, up 4.7% on a reported basis at the midpoint of our guidance. Constant currency revenue growth is expected to be about 6%, with both mortgage and non-mortgage constant currency revenue up about 6% in 2025. The assumed declines in the U.S. mortgage and hiring markets are impacting our overall growth rate by over 200 basis points. Absent these mortgage and hiring market declines, 2025 organic constant dollar revenue growth would be at the midpoint of our long-term organic growth framework of 7% to 10%. At the business unit level, we expect Workforce Solutions to deliver revenue growth of over 7% in 2025. Verification services revenue is expected to be up about 8% and lower than our long-term framework due to the weak mortgage and hiring markets. Mortgage revenue is expected to be up about 3% due to the impact of the expected decline in the U.S. mortgage market. Non-mortgage verifier revenue is expected to be up over 9%, down from the levels seen in 2024, principally driven by the expected decline in U.S. hiring and the resulting expected mid-single-digit growth in our talent business. And government growth is expected to be impacted due to tough 2024 comps and some weakness in the first half of 2025 as states adjust to modified CMS and USDA food and nutrition service funding practices. Government growth -- revenue growth should return to double-digit levels in the second half of 2025. Continued strong TWN record growth, a vitality index of over our 10% Equifax goal, and continued growth in both pricing and penetration will continue to drive verification services revenue growth despite the mortgage market and hiring market headwinds. We expect employer services to be about flat in 2025, with growth also impacted by the expected declines in U.S. hiring and onboarding. We expect USIS to deliver revenue growth of over 5% in 2025, which would bring USIS revenue to about $2 billion. We expect mortgage revenue to grow over 8% despite the expected 12% decline in hard mortgage credit inquiries. Non-mortgage revenue growth is expected to grow about 4%, up from 2% last year, and USIS revenue is expected to benefit from accelerating NPIs and share gains as they leverage the new Equifax cloud. We expect international constant currency revenue growth to be about 7% in 2025, consistent with their 7% to 9% long-term financial framework. At these revenue levels and at the midpoint of our guidance, EBITDA margins should increase about 25 basis points, with EBITDA increasing about 5% to over $1.9 billion. Adjusted EPS at the midpoint of our guidance is expected to be $7.45 per share, up 2% over last year, with free cash flow at about $900 million and free cash flow conversion at about our long-term target of 95%. With our leverage now below 2.6 turns, we are well-positioned to continue our bolt-on acquisition strategy and start increasing the return of capital to shareholders through both growing the dividend and a multi-share repurchase program during 2025. Now I'd like to turn it over to John to provide more detail on our 2025 assumptions and guidance and also provide our first quarter framework. John Gamble : Thanks, Mark. As Mark discussed and is shown on Slide 12, our planning assumes USIS hard mortgage credit inquiries are down about 13% in 1Q '25 and 12% for all of 2025, which again, in 2024, represented over 70% of the USIS mortgage revenue. Sequentially, we are assuming that our U.S. mortgage business will have normal seasonality in 2025. Slide 13 provides the specifics of our 2025 full-year guidance. 2025 is being significantly impacted by declines in U.S. mortgage and hiring markets, as well as negative FX. The year-to-year declines in these markets are impacting revenue growth by over 200 basis points, adjusted EBITDA margins by about 150 basis points, and Equifax adjusted EPS growth by about 7 percentage points. Absent these market factors, our constant currency revenue growth would be consistent with our 7% to 10% long-term framework, and adjusted EPS growth would be approaching 10%. Slide 13 also includes additional detail on expected BU adjusted EBITDA margins, as well as guidance on specific P&L line items. Equifax EBITDA margins are expected to be up about 25 basis points in 2025, which is below the 50 basis points of annual improvement in our long-term framework, principally due to revenue growth also being below our long-term framework due to market factors we just discussed. The benefits from the cost actions Mark referenced are benefiting margins more than offsetting the impact of higher costs, particularly in USIS mortgage. EWS EBITDA margins in 2025 are about 50.5%, down from the 51.8% delivered in 2024. Margins in 2025 are impacted by lower revenue growth levels, revenue mix, as well as costs related to the addition and boarding of TWN partners. USIS EBITDA margins at about 35.5% are expected to be up about 100 basis points year-to-year, realizing the full year benefit of cost reductions from decommissioning legacy systems, again, more than offsetting higher costs, particularly in mortgage. International EBITDA margins at about 28.5% are expected to expand about 100 basis points from 2024, benefiting from revenue growth and 2024 cost actions related to decommissioning legacy systems. Corporate expense, excluding depreciation and amortization, is increasing in 2025 relative to 2024, principally due to increased variable compensation as we return to target levels of incentive payouts, as well as continued investments in corporate technology, security and compliance. Depreciation and amortization is expected to increase by about $55 million in 2025 as we put significant North American and other cloud native systems into production in 2024. And our estimated tax rate is expected to be about 26.75% in 2025 and above 2024, due principally to increased impact of overseas taxes and lower U.S. development tax credits as we reduce capital spending. Capital spending should be about $480 million in 2025, down from $496 million in 2024. And as we complete the cloud, more of our capital spending will be dedicated to innovation driving revenue growth versus building our infrastructure. We believe that our guidance is centered at the midpoint of both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges. Slide 14 provides the details of our 1Q '25 guidance. In 1Q '25, we expect total Equifax revenue to be between $1.390 billion and $1.420 billion, up about 1% on a reported basis year-to-year at the midpoint. Constant dollar revenue growth at the midpoint is almost 3%, adjusted EPS in 1Q '25 is expected to be $1.33 to $1.43 per share, down 8% versus 1Q '24 at the midpoint. The decline in adjusted EPS of about $0.12 per share is principally driven by higher depreciation and amortization of about $15 million, or $0.09 a share, and the higher effective tax rate in 1Q '25, reducing adjusted EPS by about $0.02 a share. Equifax 1Q '25 adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be about 28.5% at the midpoint of our guidance, down about 50 basis points year-to-year. The sequential decline in adjusted EBITDA margins reflects seasonally higher fourth-quarter revenue and higher first quarter equity compensation. Business unit performance in first quarter is expected to be as follows. Workforce Solutions revenue growth is expected to be up about 1% year-to-year. Verification services revenue is expected to be up 2.5%. Mortgage revenue is expected to be about flat, with growth in records and pricing offset by the expected continued mortgage market decline. Verifier non-mortgage revenue is expected to be up about 3.5%. Government revenue is expected to be about flat, with a difficult comp versus 1Q '24 CMS redetermination volumes, and as Mark indicated, some weakness in the first half of 2025, as state adjust to modified CMS and USDA food and nutrition service funding practices. Government revenue growth should return to double-digit levels in the second half of 2025. Talent revenue should be up mid-single digits, as growth is impacted by expected declines in U.S. hiring. Employer revenue is expected to be down mid-single digits. EWS adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be about 49%, down about 200 basis points due to the lower revenue growth and cost impacts from boarding record contributors. USIS revenue is expected to be up about 3% year-to-year. Mortgage revenue is expected to be up about 5%, and non-mortgage revenue is expected to be up about 2.5%. Mortgage growth is being impacted by significant declines in USIS hard inquiries, which are being more than offset principally by third-party vendor pricing actions. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be up 150 basis points at about 34%, again reflecting the benefits from USIS decommissioned legacy consumer and telco and utility systems. International revenue is expected to be up about 6% in constant currency. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be flat year-to-year in 1Q, '25. Turning to Slide 15, free cash flow is expected to continue to strengthen to about $900 million and approach our 95% cash conversion goal in 2025. As Mark indicated, as we have reached leverage levels consistent with our long-term goals and targeted BBB, BAA2 credit ratings, we have significant flexibility to both restart both on acquisitions and increase capital return to shareholders. Turning to Slide 16, the U.S. mortgage market assumed in our 2025 guidance is over 50% below its historic average hard credit inquiry levels. As the mortgage market recovers toward its historic norms at current mortgage pricing and mix and current TWN records that represents on the order of $1.2 billion of annual revenue opportunity for Equifax. At current average mortgage growth margins, this would deliver adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS above the $700 million and $4 per share, respectively, that we have discussed with you in the past and that we would expect to move into our P&L as the mortgage market recovers toward normal levels in 2026 and beyond. Now I'd like to turn it back over to Mark. Mark Begor : Thanks, John. Turning to Slide 17, in 2025, our guidance reflects the challenging markets in both U.S. mortgage and hiring, resulting in our expectation that constant currency revenue at 6% will be below our long-term financial framework. Despite this end-market weakness, we expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA of over $1.9 billion driven by margin expansion of 25 basis points and about $900 million of free cash flow from cash conversion of about 95%. As end markets normalize, we are confident in our ability to deliver organic revenue growth in our 7% to 10% long-term range, continue expanding EBITDA margins at 50 basis points per year, and growing cash conversion at above 95%, while executing on our bolt-on M&A strategy. And in 2025, we expect to significantly increase return of capital to shareholders. Wrapping up on Slide 18, in 2024, Equifax delivered financial performance in 2024 that was in line with the goals we set at the beginning of the year, with revenue up almost 8% on a reported basis and on an organic constant currency basis. Adjusted EPS at $729 per share, up 8.5%, free cash flow of $813 million, and cash conversion of 89%. We had strong execution against our EFX 2027 strategic priorities in a challenging economic environment. We delivered on the critical priority of completing our North American consumer cloud transformation as well as significant portions of our global markets, with close to 85% of Equifax revenue now in the new Equifax cloud. Our cloud-native infrastructure is already providing competitive advantages of always-on stability, faster data transmission speeds, and industry-leading security for our customers. And importantly, Equifax's resources in technology, product, and DNA are pivoting from building to leveraging the Equifax cloud for innovation, new products, and growth. We are using our single-data fabric, EFX.AI, and Ignite, our analytics platform, to develop new credit solutions powered by TWN indicators in verticals like mortgage and auto that only Equifax can deliver, which we expect will lead to share gains and growth for our USIS business. Exiting 2024 with close to 85% of Equifax revenue in our new cloud environment is a huge milestone for the team, so we can fully focus on growth. We are also at an important inflection point with our accelerating free cash flow and a strong balance sheet to position Equifax to return our substantial excess free cash flow to shareholders in 2025. We are entering the next chapter of Equifax with our cloud transformation substantially complete. I'm energized by our momentum as we enter 2025, but even more energized about the future of the new Equifax. And with that, operator, let me open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. We ask you to please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. Thank you. And our first question will be coming from the line of Jeff Muller with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Muller : Yes. Thank you. Good morning. So I'm trying to listen to everything you're saying on EWS margin guidance, but it's still hard for me to reconcile margins contracting year-over-year on 7% revenue growth. And I get that there's macro factors that are impacting volumes, and there's a detrimental margin associated with that. You also called out that there's onboarding costs for new partners, but I would think you've had that for a while, including last year. So just any other factors, and if you can specifically hit on what's going on in terms of payout ratios for TWN record partners, both as you sign new and renew? Mark Begor : Yes, Jeff. I'll start. And John can jump in. I think you hit the factors impacting EWS and Equifax in 2025. Clearly the mortgage market decline takes a lot of high-calorie revenue out of the forecast, as well as the same on the talent side. Onboarding is larger now than it was in prior years. As you know, we added 20 million records last year, but we added 15 partners, including three in the fourth quarter. So we've had our highest record addition last year and our highest partner additions last year. So onboarding, we do expect to be larger in 2025, those onboarding costs, which of course will benefit us in the future moving forward. What else, John, would you add? John Gamble : Yes. So we have seen also nice growth. We talked about it in insights. We've seen nice growth in some education products, and we want to continue to drive that growth. But those products have lower variable margins and contribution margins, obviously, than TWN that has very, very high margins. So that is pressuring margins to a degree. And we're continuing to make substantial investments in EWS to drive future growth and deliver new products, and given the fact that revenue growth is a bit lower, that obviously is somewhat detrimental to margin in a year. So overall, I think we still expect this to be a very strong margin business. We believe as the mortgage market and hiring recovers, we're going to return to margin growth. But the factors we just talked about, plus the headwinds of the difficult markets, is what's resulting in the decline in '25. Jeff Muller : Okay. But just on the payout ratios that you're paying, I get that. John Gamble : No change. Yes, sorry, Jeff. Sorry, I didn't cover that one. No change. There's no change in our payout ratios. We have about 60 partners. I think there was a handful of those that extended last year, same terms as in the past. No change in what our payouts are. We have attractive partnerships with a lot of partners. They get a lot of value out of it, and so do we, but we see no change in those payout ratios. That's not impacting our margins at all. Jeff Muller : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions. Manav Patnaik : Good morning. I just wanted to confirm, Mark, when you said without the mortgage and hiring headwinds go to being 200 base points higher, I guess is that assuming that those markets would be flat? And then I just wanted to know how you would quantify what the EPS impact of that would be? Mark Begor : Yes, and Manav, I think, as you know, back in October when we talked about our third-quarter earnings, we gave you some comments around what trends were at that time and rolled that forward to 2025. At that time, we thought the mortgage market was going to be up about 5 points based on current trends, and obviously the decline that happened in mid-December and is happening as we speak was surprising to us. Obviously 7% mortgage rates are high, but the decline was a lot sharper than we expected over the last six weeks. So really what we're comparing to is, somewhere between that flat and up 5. When we think about the impact that it would have had, because as recently as two months ago we were looking at 2025 being a slightly positive mortgage market environment, and it's not now. From an EPS standpoint, it's very high calories. John Gamble : So Manav, when we calculated the benefit to EPS, obviously we just assumed recovery to a flat market. The growth rate recovery, again, is just really relative to a flat market, and we just used the variable margins that we would have on those products. And so we assumed both for mortgage USIS and TWN increase would go to flat, and then we just assumed the hiring market as opposed to being down 8 would be flat, and we flowed through a variable margin. Manav Patnaik : Okay, got it. And then maybe just on the government side, Mark, just help us with that cadence again in terms of what's going on there, and are you seeing any early impacts from Doge and all that stuff that's been thrown out there? Mark Begor : Yes, so I think you're focused on maybe the fourth quarter and 2025. We have been performing exceptionally well, as you know, with very high growth rates, so you're getting into some hard comps in the fourth quarter and then in 2025, including in the first quarter. We did mention that CMS in particular made a change in the reimbursement program with the states where they used to reimburse that CMS, reimbursed 100% of data costs. They're now at 75%, so the states have to pay 25. That had some impact in the fourth and likely in the first as states are adjusting to that. As you know, states have budgets. And if they're going to start paying for some of that data cost themselves, they've got to adjust their budgeting and their operating statements. And we're focused on working with the states to, in some cases, going direct to them with our solutions that have some impact in the first half of the year on our government business. As John said, we expect the government business to return to double-digit growth in the second half. You may remember we signed a large contract extension with SSA in September last year. That really comes into effect in 2025, so that'll have a positive impact, particularly in the second half. And then our contracts have pricing escalators that aren't uniform on when they go into effect during the year. But we have some larger government contracts that have escalators that are positively impacting the second half, so that's another good guy as we get into the year. Anything else, John? John Gamble : Just in the first half, and Mark mentioned it, we're still dealing with the fact that there were redeterminations in the first quarter of last year and part of the second quarter, so revenue was very strong in the first quarter of 2024 and moving into the second quarter of 2024. Manav Patnaik : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions. Andrew Steinerman : Hi. Two quick ones on mortgage. The first one is, John, could you just tell us what mortgage revenues were as a percentage of fourth-quarter revenues? And the second one is just to make sure we get a definition of U.S. hard mortgage credit increase, which Equifax has been seeing down for the last six weeks, as you just stated. That's a difference from what the MBA has reported on their mortgage weekly application reports, and I just wanted to know if maybe you're measuring different things hard versus soft. I'm not sure, really? John Gamble : So 4Q '24 was 17.7%, and you know this, Andrew, we've been disclosing hard inquiries, the inquiries that actually impact your credit file for 10-plus years, right? And so we consistently disclose that number. It doesn't include soft inquiries, right, so a pre-qual or a pre-approval product, and we focus on hard inquiries because that's what's in the tri-merge, that's what's required to be purchased to close a loan, and we think that probably has the highest level of correlation over time with originations, right? And we've taken a look at originations historically, and we have good origination data in the credit file through, think about early 2024. That time period relative to the 15 to 19 average is down something on the order of 45%, and if you look at hard inquiries in that same time period, we're down not quite 50%, so the correlation seems quite good, and that's why we continue to disclose that number specifically. Andrew Steinerman : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Toni Kaplan : Thanks so much. Maybe first on just USIS 2% non-mortgage growth versus last quarter of up 5, just wanted to hear about any sort of changes in the selling environment or just any factors you wanted to share on sort of the overall broad market conditions that you're seeing, and obviously you've mentioned mortgage and hiring, but anything outside of those two would be helpful? John Gamble : Generally speaking, I think what we indicated is we thought auto performed relatively well in the fourth quarter. We thought FI, also low single digits, performed relatively well. I think the biggest difference that you saw was that FMS in the third quarter was up double digits. The team did a great job selling into some new customers in the third quarter, which drove FMS very strong. We talked about the fact that we built some outstanding new relationships in the payment industry. Some of that really drove really good growth in our FMS or batch business, so that was probably the biggest difference between what was delivered in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, but in terms of online, I think we feel like auto performed relatively well. Again, low single digits, FI, low single digits, D2C actually came back to growth for the first time in quite some time, and we actually saw a little bit of performance and insurance. So I'd say the online performance, relatively consistent, the big difference was FMS. Toni Kaplan : Great. And then on my follow-up, I did want to ask about the government opportunity. I know you've spoke a lot about the trajectory, so thank you for giving that. Just more in general, when you think about government programs, I feel like you had some success with CMS and SSA, but I guess as the government's sort of rethinking their programs and you can provide some efficiency to them, how are you thinking about the opportunity for like basically getting new programs, but offset by the point that potentially there could be a lot of programs that are cut? So how do you sell into that environment? How are you thinking about the change in opportunity just more broadly? Thanks. Mark Begor : Yes, it's a great question, Toni. We still think there's a big market opportunity, and in this administration, even more focus around delivering social services accurately to those in need and focusing on where there's improper payments or abuse in the system, which really means people that are receiving benefits that perhaps don't qualify. And I think we've all read and seen all the studies that says there's quite a bit of that. Our view is, and I suspect it's yours too, is that broadly social services aren't going to be cut. There will be a focus, and we see a focus in Washington, and we're working both on the Hill and also towards the White House around how our programs can really help in the delivery of social services accurately. So that's, we think, a positive macro for Equifax. I know you know the TAM for us is about $5 billion of manual verifications that are done in the government space, and again, it's done at the state level. We have penetration in a lot of states, but a lot of states are fully manual, and as you know, a state is not typically a customer. It's the agencies within a state. So we've got a large commercial team. We're out there selling the productivity from using our solution, the accuracy and speed from using our solution, and again, the big macro, I think, a positive for us in 2025 is broadly there's been a bigger focus in Washington around accuracy, which we think plays well to our data, which is verified. So, we remain very bullish on the future of our government business in that big $5 billion TAM. We exited the year at roughly $700 million, so we've got a lot of opportunity. And the battleground for us, or the opportunity, is really at the state level and in the agencies. So that's why we've got Equifax resources deployed in the state capitals to really work on these programs. So we remain very optimistic around government in the future. Toni Kaplan : Super. Thanks. Operator : Our next questions are from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Faiza Alwy : Yes. Hi. Thank you. So I wanted to follow up on the pre-qual products and the soft pulls. I think you mentioned that 70% of maybe the inquiries or the revenues are hard pull. So I just wanted to clarify if that's what you meant, that 30% are soft pulls and 70% are hard credit pulls. So I'm curious what you're expecting in terms of the penetration of pre-qual products, and if you're seeing any share shifts there, whether lenders are using one or two bureaus? And how are you in the initial shopping process, and how do you expect that to play out in '25? Mark Begor : Yes, it started playing out in 2024. Your metrics are pretty close that there's a large shopping element or soft pole element of mortgage. That was a real tailwind for us following COVID when rates started to increase, people were shopping around further. We have seen some decrease in shopping, really as a part of what we've seen in the last, call it two months or six, eight weeks. As rates went higher, people, those that are shopping are still shopping, but there's less people shopping, thinking about a mortgage. So there's been a change in consumer confidence. The other changes that we've seen happening is there's some moves by mortgage originators who historically might pull all three in the shopping process, some originators are either pulling one or two credit files instead of the full three, which obviously has an impact on our revenue. Our focus there is obviously to be responsive commercially, but more importantly is a big focus around our differentiated data. And I talked about, we're rolling out as we speak a, call it a shopping credit file for mortgage that has TWN indicators on it, TWN data that makes our shopping file more valuable to the mortgage originator, because we want to differentiate between our competitors in that 1 and 2B world in the shopping side. You may remember we also have NC plus attributes that we're including with our mortgage credit file, that also differentiates our mortgage credit file in that shopping process. And unrelated to mortgage, we're doing the same thing, as I mentioned, in auto. We'll be rolling out, in the first half of this year a TWN indicator on our auto credit file for the same reason. And obviously what we want to do is provide incremental value with the TWN data on our credit file for both mortgage and auto, but still capture the TWN full pulls, which are required for mortgage and are required for auto that happen later in the process. So it's -- I think, a really attractive advantage for Equifax to compete in both spaces with our differentiated data that really only we have. Only Equifax can put those TWN indicators on our mortgage and credit file. John Gamble : And just in terms of the numbers, right, so we were quoting revenue, right, so it's something over 70% of revenue is hard pulls. And then in addition to soft pulls, there's a high single-digit percentage of batch job, UDM, property data, rental data, et cetera, that wouldn't be a soft pull, right? So when you break down our mortgage revenue, it's something over 70s hard pulls, high single-digit percentage is the other things that I just referenced, and the remainder would be soft inquiries. Faiza Alwy : Got it. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, apologies if I missed this, but any thoughts on TWN inquiries for '25 and outperformance, I know we saw some improvement in the fourth quarter on both of those metrics, so curious how you're thinking about that? Mark Begor : Yes, just in general, right, we're expecting TWN inquiries probably to be a little better than mortgage inquiries in 2025, just for the shopping reasons Mark referenced, and I'm talking about hard inquiries, but really no more specificity than that. Faiza Alwy : All right, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Kyle Peterson with Needham. Please proceed with your question. Kyle Peterson : Great. Good morning and thank you for taking the question. Just one for me. I wanted to focus on capital allocation, obviously the leverage and balance sheets in a pretty good spot. You guys are kind of hinting at both increasing the dividend and starting a buyback. How are you guys thinking about balancing and priorities between the two as well as potential timing as to when we can see some of these actions, as in like is it middle of the year, late in the year, how should we think about that? Mark Begor : Yes, I think we tried to be more than hinting, and we've been doing that for quite some time. As you know, it's been a goal of ours to complete the cloud transformation where we invested quite a bit of CapEx into moving us to the cloud-native mode, and then when that CapEx coming down is in our margin expansion and the savings from that really generated a lot of excess free cash flow. So, we checked that box at close to 85% in the cloud. That's complete. The one we want to see a little more visibility around before making that decision, really to your timing question, is where is the economy? Where is the mortgage market? Where is the hiring market? Just to be frank, 60 days ago, call it, in kind of November and early December, we didn't anticipate rates going to 7 or the mortgage market declining 12% over the last 6, 7 weeks. That has been surprising to us, and it's so rapid and so recent. We want to see a little more time there. Where is that mortgage market going? Where are rates going? What impact are tariffs going to have on that? So I think getting through a portion of the year so we have some more visibility on that, I think, will be quite important. Our confidence around our guidance for 2025 is high with the underpinning of the mortgage market and hiring market, which we think we've baselined as the best data we have now. And as we mentioned, we're going to have very strong free cash generation this year. Even with our EBITDA expansion, we're going to generate a lot of EBITDA and a lot of excess free cash flow. We do plan to use some of that, both leverage that grows with our margins expanding and EBITDA expanding, as well as the free cash, to look for continued attractive bolt-on M&A. No change in our bolt-on M&A strategy. And then we want to return cash to shareholders. We want to get back to growing the dividend again, and we'll give that framework on growing the dividend at the right time in 2025. And then we also want to return cash to shareholders. What we would envision is a multi-year buyback program authorization by our board to buy back stock as we go through '25, '26, '27, pick that timeframe. And when you look out in our model, I think yours looks like that, too, and you can pick your mortgage market assumptions or recovery assumptions, we generate a lot of cash over the next three-plus years, and it's going to give us the ability to return that cash to shareholders. So that's been a clear part of our strategy, and it's a focus of ours, and we clearly envision implementing that in 2025. Kyle Peterson : All right, thank you very much. Operator : Our next questions are from the line of Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Pleased proceed with your question. Craig Huber : Yes, thank you. Just want to just better understand, I mean, obviously trying to forecast the U.S. mortgage market has been quite difficult for a number of years and so forth. You're obviously taking, extrapolating the current trends out for the remainder of the year. There's nothing new with how you guys forecast the mortgage part of your business and so forth. The rest of your business, however, you are making some various assumptions and so forth, and maybe you can just talk about the differences there, about how you put together your outlook for the year? Thank you. Mark Begor : Yes, no, change in how we do that. We don't have many parts of our business that are impacted by macros. Really mortgage principally is one, and to a lesser degree, the hiring market, it's a smaller impact, but when you have a 10% decline in the underlying activity, which we've heard from background screeners, has been happening same thing over the last, call it, 60, 80, 90 days, that has an impact. For the rest of the business, we have a lot of visibility. We know that we took price up on 1-1 broadly across all of Equifax. We know what that price is. We know where we have subscription agreements that are in place, multi-year contracts, either with minimums or with terms in them that we can forecast. We have deal pipelines where we're adding new business. We have contracts that we signed last year. They're going into effect this year that we lay into our forecast. On the record side in EWS, we have quite a bit of visibility of new partners that we added to three in the fourth quarter and some that we added in the second half, record editions, when we expect those to come online. As you know, those translate into revenue instantly, as soon as we add the records because we have the inquiries coming in. With other partners that are already with us, we also have lots of programs with them because we don't have all their records typically. So we're working with them to add those records in. So across the rest of the business, I think we have a lot of visibility, and we typically are able to forecast well. Our goal in setting a framework for the quarter or for the year, in this case, first quarter in 2025, is to lay out our best forecast, a forecast that we know how to meet and with a goal of beating it. I would say, like any company, we try to have the right balance of conservatism in that forecast with that goal of delivering for our investors around what we lay out. John Gamble : I mean specifically around auto, for example, I think our expectation is auto sales, new and used kind of flat, maybe a little better. Again, we get input from our customers, similar concept around card and personal loans. I mean, generally speaking, I think -- we think the consumer is relatively healthy, but we are seeing some cracks in consumer confidence. We've seen that obviously come through in January, and then internationally, we're assuming that we're going to see the markets continue to grow, but nothing substantial, not really any stronger than their long-term average growth framework and probably the UK and Europe were expecting to see slower growth in their long-term framework. Craig Huber : I appreciate that. A follow-up question here on the Vitality Index, are there any specific products that you'd want to call out that you're very energized about for long-term growth that you guys are putting in place there? Thank you. Mark Begor : Yes, there's a whole bunch, and I already highlighted, I'll highlight again because it's top of my list, is with USIS now in the cloud, obviously, EWS got in the cloud a couple of years ago, we can now combine those data assets, and we think that's going to be super powerful. And as I mentioned a few minutes ago in my prepared comments, the rollout of a mortgage credit file that includes TWN indicators on it, we think is very powerful because only we can deliver that. We're doing the same thing with our cell phone utility attributes on the mortgage credit file, and then we're going to do the same thing in auto and likely in personal loans because we think it'll differentiate our credit file, and that's going to be particularly powerful when there's only one credit file being pulled. We want to be the one to be pulled, we want to drive market share there. So I think the cloud is really giving us, in our single data fabric, a lot of opportunities to leverage our differentiated data assets. We're also having great success with a solution here in the U.S. we call OneScore, which takes our non-credit file data sets, and as you know, we have the cell phone utility data set, we have DataX and Teletrack that we acquired. You put that together, we have a very large set of consumers and trade lines that are not in the credit file, which allows us to differentiate our credit file again and drive performance. The third one I would highlight is just the use of AI. We've been ramping up our AI capabilities around scores and models and products. I think, as you know, we're using it in the vast majority of our models and scores today, and we're seeing very meaningful performance lifts around wider sets of data being used in that score and model driving performance, like the OneScore data element. So a whole bunch there, and as you know, innovation and new products is central to our strategy and our DNA at Equifax. We report to you, we run the company around the Vitality Index, and that makes us a stronger partner with our customers. When we're innovating and bringing new ideas to our customers, we're viewed as a more valued partner, so that's clearly central to how we want to operate in Equifax going forward in the cloud, and our scale-differentiated data really enables us to be advantaged around that innovation and new products. John Gamble : I just wanted to clarify, my answer to the last question about international growth rates was relative to economies, not the Equifax growth rates themselves. Craig Huber : Understood, thanks guys. Operator : Our next questions are from the line of Jason Haas with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions. Jason Haas : Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. I'm apologies that I missed it. But can you say what the talent verification outperformance was versus white collar higher market in a 4Q? And then how do you expect that to trend going forward? I think that'll give us some helpful understanding of how to think about talent excluding the impacts from the softer hiring market? Thanks. Mark Begor : Yes, so at the fourth quarter we indicated it was about eight points, right, better That was a little weaker than it was in the third quarter I don't think we gave guidance for what it would be going forward. But historically we've been running somewhere between high single digits and low double digits better than the market over time. Fourth quarter was a little weaker than third quarter and it was really specific to the way pricing -- our annual pricing was executed in the two different years. Our 2024 annual price increases actually a portion of them were executed in the fourth quarter of '23 and then the remainder in the first quarter of '24. Our 2025 price increases substantially hit in the first quarter of 2025. So we just had a grow over effect issue in the fourth quarter of '24 versus 2023 because of the difference in timing of price increases. Jason Haas : Okay, great. That's very helpful. Thank you. And then as a follow-up can you talk about the implied USIS mortgage outperformance for 2025. I think if I did math, right and I heard everything correctly. It's about 20 percentage points of mortgage outperformance. It's a bit of a step down from 2024. I think I might know why, but can you can you talk about that? That'd be helpful. Thanks. John Gamble : Yes. So the biggest difference is really around, and it was a question that was asked earlier around soft pulls, around pre-qual and pre-approval products. What we saw going from 2023 to 2024, since those products were relatively new in late 2023 going into 2024, was very, very substantial growth in those products in 2024. So that drove a substantial amount of outperformance relative to hard pulls. What we're expecting in 2025 is we're continuing to expect pre-approval and pre-qual to perform well, but the growth rate will obviously be much lower because of the fact that we're coming off of a much larger base. So that's really the biggest difference in outperformance. We're expecting to continue to perform well year-on-year. We continue to drive more new products. Mark talked about it substantially. But it's really just the difference in the base on pre-qual that's driving the difference in growth rate. Jason Haas : Okay. And I'm sorry to ask third follow up, or second follow-up, but I thought maybe you would also allude to the supplier prices increased. So is that less of a tailwind in 2025 than it was in 2024? John Gamble : On dollar amounts, they're relatively similar. Jason Haas : Okay. All right. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : The next questions are from the line of Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. Owen Lau : Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So on your international revenue growth, it was 11% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and you guided to 7% in 2025 and 6% in the first quarter. Could you please unpack a little bit more about the driver of that slowdown? Thanks. John Gamble : Actually, we think 7% is quite good, right? So our long-term model is 7% to 9%. So we feel very, very good about the 7% to 9% growth. I think Mark talked about where we're seeing the growth come from, and the good news is what we're seeing is really improved performance and growth really across all geographies. The only geography I think that's dealing with a little bit of market headwinds is the UK, and we're seeing some economic slowdown in the UK. That's affecting us in 2025 as well as we're expecting the UK economy in general to be a bit weaker. Brazil was really strong in the fourth quarter. We had an outstanding performance from Brazil in the fourth quarter. And in the second half, really we're expecting the Brazil to perform well in 2025, perhaps not double digits, but we're very happy with the way our Brazil acquisition is performing, so, net-net I'd say, we feel pretty good about the 7% next year. Owen Lau : Got it. So quickly on mortgage assumption, I know there's lots of questions about mortgage already, but you mentioned that you haven't baked in any weight cut or weight increase. But if there is a, let's say, 25 to 50 basis point rate cut in 2025, do you still expect incremental benefits for your mortgage increase given that last year's 30-year mortgage went down to 6% and there was a refinancing weight already? How do you think about that this year? Thanks. Mark Begor : Yes. We have seen, you know, with changes in the 10-year and changes in the mortgage rates had definitely an impact. Back in kind of August, September, when mortgage rates went down with the 10-year in advance of the election, we did see an uptick in activity or inquiries, both shopping and mortgages, both purchase and refi, as you point out. This late-year impact that happened in mid-December and all the way through January when rates went above 7, surprised us with the magnitude of it and how deep it's been to drop another 12 points. But yes, we've clearly seen as rates move up, there's an impact and we would expect the same if rates come down. It's hard to see that now with rates, with the tariff discussions going on and when is that going to settle down in the marketplace and how the bond market reacts, which, as you know, has a big impact on mortgage rates. And then John mentioned it and I mentioned it also is that there's some element of consumer confidence. That is lower right now, which rolls into decisions around buying a home or decisions around buying a car. That clearly is consumer confidence is lower perhaps with all the activity taking place in the new administration, we're clearly seeing that. Over the long term, we're 50% below historic levels in mortgage inquiry activity. We don't think that's going to stay there over the long term. The question is, when will rates come down? And we've been very clear and we showed it in our deck again today that we expect that to be a very meaningful impact for Equifax to the tune of over a billion dollars of incremental revenue as well as incremental margin. And we'll flow that through if there's a positive impact against our minus 12 outlook. We would expect that to be accretive to our framework for 2025, meaning that we'd have incremental revenue and we'd let that margin drop through. We're doing the right investments for the future of Equifax as you expect us to do. We wouldn't incrementally invest more if the mortgage market recovers. We're going to continue to focus over the long term for Equifax. And if there is an uptick, that's going to drive our margins up and our EPS and our cash flow up. John Gamble : And as Mark mentioned, again, our long term framework only assumes that we're going to see modest growth in overall markets, including mortgage, 2% to 3%, right? So, again, to deliver our long term framework, which includes substantial revenue growth and earnings growth of north of 10%, right? We don't need the mortgage market to fully recover. We just need the mortgage market to stabilize and start growing slowly 2 to 3 points a year and we can deliver extremely well. Owen Lau : Got it, thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions are from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Nicholas : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First one is on margins. I think inter quarter you talked about wanting to or thinking you can kind of approach 100 basis points of a margin expansion, 25. Obviously, the 25 basis point guide this year is a little bit lower. But if I do the math, it seems like the lighter mortgage would more than account for that delta. So I'm wondering if there were other kind of cost actions you took into your quarter to protect margins or if maybe you're getting a bit better expansion than you had thought from the tech transformation in '25? Mark Begor : Yes, so the numbers you quoted are correct, right? So I think the team did a really nice job in the fourth quarter. What you saw is on weaker revenue. We delivered the margins we committed and I think the team did a nice job of managing costs as we went through the fourth quarter. So obviously, as we're going into next year, we're continuing to try to manage costs closely to allow ourselves to deliver margin growth even in the face of those substantial declines in both mortgage but also talent. John Gamble : We implemented sizable cloud cost savings in the third quarter that, as you know, are giving us year- over-year benefit in 2025. So we have real visibility of that, but those are done, right? So we've already completed those. So that's good news for us as we go into '25. And we have some incremental cloud cost savings. As you know, we still have some markets we're completing. We're going to complete Spain in the first quarter. We'll get some small benefit from that. We've got Paraguay we completed in December. So those kind of completions that kind of roll through '25 as we move from that close to 85% of our rev in the cloud towards the 100% present incremental cloud cost savings principally in '25. So we've got those in our outlook. Andrew Nicholas : Perfect. Thank you. And then for my follow-up, I know it's a little bit more detailed, but on the new product that you're, or set of products that you're offering that are going to have the TWN data flags on them in mortgage and in auto later in the year. Is that predominantly a market share play or do you also get more price for those products with that flag? Just trying to understand kind of strategically how that plays out? Mark Begor : We'd look for both. If you think about mortgage where some customers are only using one file in shopping, we want to be that file. So getting that incremental revenue or market share as you describe it is very attractive. We're delivering more value so we should get price for it. And then same thing in auto. Auto, many dealers will pull one mortgage credit file when a consumer comes in. We want to be that credit file we pull, because it's pulled -- because we're going to provide incremental information around the eligibility for that consumer. Because remember they'll get auto and in mortgage, but I'll use auto example. A consumer comes in, their credit is super important, but many auto loans require income verification and certain income levels in order to qualify for that auto loan. Knowing that upfront in the early stages of that consumer interaction is super valuable and only Equifax can provide it. As I mentioned, we'll likely have a solution for personal loans and as an old credit card guy, I know the value of combining income with credit score even in a credit card space. So the power we have now is having those data assets, TWN in our credit assets and USIS, but having both businesses in the cloud, post USIS completing the cloud last summer gives us the ability to really leverage those in the marketplace and drive share and drive revenue and price. Andrew Nicholas : Thank you. Operator : Next question is from the line of Kelsey Zhu with Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your question. Kelsey Zhu : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I want to talk about the SSA contract extension that you've announced at the end of Q3. Was wondering if you can talk a little bit more about what's the current level of run rate revenue in 2024 from SSA and they expect the growth in 2025 and beyond. I think the originally announced 500 million for five years does rely on some amount of further state penetration as well. So just wondering how you're thinking about that in light of CMS changing their rings [ph]? Mark Begor : Yes, this particular contract with SSA is a federal contract, so it's not one that's done like CMS where the states deliver that service and the states use the data at the local agency level. And as you point out, the customer for us in CMS is really the agency at the state level. In the case of CMS, this is a federal contract that's used for disability benefits eligibility that are delivered directly at the federal level, and it's really used to authenticate the individual's recipients' eligibility to continue receiving that Social Security disability income. If they have a change in income, then it changes their benefits eligibility. So that's a contract that we've had in place in the past. We extended the contract in September with higher prices in it, and that's what I mentioned is going to give us benefits as we go into 2025. Kelsey Zhu : Thanks. I was also wondering if you have any updated thoughts on sizing the incremental record additions from the Workday Partnership, or just in general, how should we think about record growth in 2025? Mark Begor : As you know, we typically don't discuss any of our partners. Workday is unique because we both announced it last September, so we just highlight the fact that we have that one. So we don't talk about what specific partner record additions in. We have over 60 partners, and as I said, we added 14 last year plus Workday, including three of those 15 in the fourth quarter. Record additions were very strong last year. 20 million records, up 12%. That's higher than what we expect over the long term, but record additions have been quite strong over the last five years, above our long term, for EWS, we think about record additions being in the 3%, 4% range, so very strong years. The positive for 2025 is we have a lot of visibility around three partners we added in the fourth quarter. Those records didn't come on yet. We have partners we added in the second half that were still onboarding records. And as I mentioned earlier, we have partners we added two, three, four, five years ago where we're still adding records. When they get a new client, those become new records, but typically we have pockets of records, given the structure of their technology or databases, that were still onboarding to Equifax, even from partners that are a couple of years ago, so that's a big part of our visibility around records when we look forward a quarter or through a year like 2025. And then we also have a list of a set of potential partners that we've been talking to for a year, two years, three years that are not with Equifax today that we're looking to bring onboard, like the 15 we added last year. Then as a reminder, a little under 50% of our records come from our direct relationships through our employer business, and as we grow I-9 clients or UC clients, they're bringing in records there also. So it's a multifaceted approach. We have one leader and one team that drives record additions. That was a change we made a year ago, and it's paid off in 2024 with the kind of focus from having a dedicated leader giving the obvious benefit or value of adding records. So we've got a big focus on that. We're expecting record growth in 2025 that is aligned with the growth frameworks we laid out for the year for EWS. Kelsey Zhu : Thanks a lot. Operator : The next question is from the line of Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Wurtzel : Hey guys, good morning. Just one question from me. When we think about the guidance for EWS revenue growth and sort of in the context of your medium-term framework, that color on records growth was helpful, but maybe if you can frame sort of the kind of pricing and penetration contribution to growth for this year that you're expecting relative to the long-term growth framework? Thanks. Mark Begor : Yes, as you know, we don't talk about pricing any of our businesses, but we can be clear that we take price up every year in all of our businesses, including EWS. I think we've said many times we have more pricing advantage, if you will, because the uniqueness of what we deliver with EWS and TWN than we do in other parts of Equifax. Penetration will be a positive for us in 2025. In EWS, we expect new product rollouts to also be a positive. They've been over-indexing our 10% goal for, gosh, almost four years in EWS. We expect, again, very strong over 10% vitality, so the continued rollout of new products. As you point out, records is an important pillar on the ability to grow in that space. And then penetration, we just have large verticals with a lot of room to grow, and we're principally competing, as you know, against manual verifications, whether it's a verification of employment with a background screener, verification of income with a government agency, in auto, where there's still penetration opportunities. So those are some of the areas where our teams are focused on. Scott Group : That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is David on for Ashish. Thanks for taking our question. Just a follow-up to that last question. Are you seeing any, I know you're not commenting on pricing, but are you seeing any competitive dynamic shifts related to the First Advantage and Sterling merger? Thank you. Mark Begor : Yes, we don't talk about specific customers. As you know, we have a great relationship with Sterling and a great relationship with First Advantage, and we do with the other background screeners. We view them as strategic partners, and we have all kinds of relationships with them, whether it's a verification of employment, we have an education solution, we sell incarceration data to them, new products that we're working to deliver to them. So I don't want to talk about specific impacts, but we have very strong partnerships with the two you mentioned, as well as the rest of the industry. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Operator : Our next questions are from the line of Matt O'Neill with FT Partners. Please proceed with your question. Matt O'Neill: Yes, hi. Thank you so much for taking my question. Just curious, going back to the talent and labor area, any incremental comments on verticals, employer sort of size or type, sort of public-private, where some of the conservatism or weakness is most noted? And then while I fully understand not commenting on price, I guess just with the mortgage score price rolling through last month, just curious if there is anything of note there, if that's been a smooth process? Thank you so much. Mark Begor : Yes, the first one on hiring, and remember, it also impacts us in onboarding, where we're selling I-9 solutions. If there's less new employees, there's less background screens, there's less I-9. So clearly an impact, and you use the term conservatism. We're telling you what trends are. When we talk with our customers, it's very broad-based. There's a mode, it seems to be kind of coming into the election and post-election, that companies are keeping a tight belt around hiring as they think about their budgets and plans for 2025, as they are concerned about what's going to be the impact in Washington. The whole tariff conversations create a lot of angst with lots of customers about what's going to happen. I think you've seen the impact on consumer confidence that likely is impacting lots of customers when they think about what kind of investments around people and resources. But it's been surprising to us, like mortgage, that the hiring activity declined so meaningfully in the latter half of the quarter, kind of post the election. Companies are kind of sitting on the sidelines to see how is this all going to play out. When that happens, you just don't hire a lot of people, and that clearly impacts us. And sorry, the second half of your question was, I think, on the supplier pricing increase that went through. What was the question? Matt O'Neill: Just if there was anything to note on how that's flowing through in the market, or if it's been fairly received as expected. Mark Begor : I think received as expected is probably the right way to describe it. Nobody likes a price increase, and a price increase of that size is challenging. But we did mention that there's some change in behavior around the shopping process where historically a mortgage originator might have pulled three credit files from all three credit bureaus in that shopping process. Some changes going to a single pull, or a dual pull, and then pulling the three later on in the process, that's likely driven by the cost of the credit file. That's why we're focused on how do we differentiate our credit file. And we're quite energized about our ability to add those TWN indicators to it that we would expect would drive share and revenue for us having something that is differentiated from our competitors. Matt O'Neill: Makes a lot of sense. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Simon Clinch with Redburn Atlantic. Please proceed with your question. Simon Clinch : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I've got two questions. First of all, just wondering if you could just walk through the outperformance that we've seen in EWS Mortgage just over the last four quarters. We've seen certainly weaker contribution from pricing and mix as you've talked about before, but that's still sort of pervasive today despite easier comparisons and as well as your records growth on top of that. So I was wondering how we should think about that portion going forward from here? John Gamble : So you're referring to the performance of mortgage revenue relative to underlying inquiries when you say, is that what you're asking about? Mark Begor : In EWS. John Gamble : In EWS. Simon Clinch : Yes. And if I strip out the records growth contribution? John Gamble : We think it's actually strengthened as we've gone through the year. We feel relatively good about the performance we've seen in terms of adding records, which is the biggest driver in our ability to outperform the underlying inquiry market. So we feel very good about how it's progressed during the year. Mark Begor : It improved during the year. John Gamble : Yes, very nice during the entire year, and we ended up double-digit in the fourth quarter. So we think the performance is good, and it's all driven by, heavily driven by what Mark talked about, which is the tremendous success we had this year in boarding new records. And as we go into next year, that will be the driver again. So our ability to continue to successfully board new records, which we feel very good about, is what's going to allow us to continue to perform well relative to whatever the mortgage market does. Mark Begor : And I remind you, I know this makes sense, but not every record that's added is a mortgage customer. As you know, a smaller portion of the population in the United States owns a home and will participate in the mortgage space. Generally, they're near-prime and prime customers. We're adding records that are called subprime customers or lower income consumers, and those records are super valuable in auto loans, they're super value in personal loans, and they're really super valuable in government. And the beauty of EWS is that every record we add now, given the demographics of the different verticals we participate in, have value, and generally multiple value going forward. So it's a really powerful model on records. In addition to records in the mortgage space, we do take a price, we do roll out new products, which we rolled some new products out in the second half of last year in EWS, and we've got some new products rolling out in 2025, like the TWN indicator that we talked about that will be a positive for Equifax revenue. Simon Clinch : Okay, that's helpful. Just on the point about the TWN indicator, I know you've had a few questions on this already, but when I'm thinking about the indicator that you're going to bundle with the credit file, is that one going to be available only to customers of EWS verifications, first and foremost? And then secondarily, how are you going to balance? How do you balance the risk of reducing the value of the records from EWS by providing that indicator in the credit file? John Gamble : That's a great question. In the mortgage space, most mortgage originators, I'd say the vast majority of mortgage originators use TWN, so they're customers now. Auto, there's pockets of customers that don't, so that'll be an opportunity. But we'll make this credit file with the TWN indicators available to all customers, because even if they're doing a manual verification, which is a very small portion in mortgage origin, called a larger portion in auto, knowing upfront that Mark's employed when they're in the shopping process with Mark in a mortgage or auto application is very valuable. And we're going to be very careful, as you might imagine, around giving, it's not slivers of information, but giving important information upfront that helps in the shopping process, but being very balanced around the fact that we want to protect that full pull that happens later on. It's very deep levels of data. We have 50 different attributes on the full TWN credit report. It's got trended data going back 12 months, 24 months, 36 months. That's not what we're anticipating put upfront on the mortgage shopping or auto shopping credit file. What that originator or F&I individual at a dealer needs is Mark employed. It might be, you know, where is Mark working? It might be an average of Mark's income over the last 12 months, just some snippets, if you will, that are super valuable in that shopping process to really separate a consumer that maybe couldn't qualify for that auto loan or mortgage. So do you want to work on that with that consumer, or help steer what kind of products to put in front of that consumer by having that additional information. Because remember, a credit score, which comes with today is really what you get in a shopping process is a credit score and a credit file, really just gives information around someone's propensity to repay their new loan based on their past behavior. But it has zero information about their ability to repay. You know, they might have a decent credit score, but they're out of work. You don't have visibility to that. So that's the kind of thing we want to deliver up front. We think it'll differentiate our credit file and deliver more value to our customers in their workflows. And then, as I mentioned twice now, protect the, actually credit files of a full credit file typically pulled in many of these processes, a second or third time, but to also protect the TWN reports that are pulled either once or twice or sometimes three times in those workflows dependent upon the vertical. Simon Clinch : That's great. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Arthur Truslove with Citi. Pleased proceed with your questions. Arthur Truslove : Thanks, everyone. A couple from me. So first one, you've said that your margin in USIS can go up from 34.5% in 2014 to 35.5% in 2025. I was just wondering why this increase was so small. I mean, I guess given the cloud-based cost savings, you might have expected, 300 bps or so. So just wondered, what was missing there. Second question. You've made clear on this call that over the last month or two, the situation in mortgage and hiring has clearly deteriorated. And it seems like this is probably the key reason to you guiding down at this point. I just wanted to confirm as well, your mortgage forecast of minus 12% on volumes, that is just a function of what you've seen in the last few weeks, isn't it? And that obviously factors in mortgage rates at 7%. So can you just confirm that I've understood that properly? Mark Begor : Yes, the second one, 100%. What we've seen over the last six, seven weeks has been a sharp decline, surprising in the depth of it, but a reality. And what we're seeing as far as activity is rates went over 7%. And I think you'd have to lay in there not only the rate shock of that, but also perhaps consumer confidence, and what they're reading in the paper about what's happening, all the activity in Washington. And just to be clear again, we'll update this again when we see changes in it. For sure, we'll give you an update in April when we report our first quarter earnings. Over the last 10 years, this is how we forecasted mortgage because we're not economists. We can't forecast interest rate increases or decreases. But we've been super clear with you that if this improves, that'll expand our revenue and expand our margins in our EPS. If either there's a change in confidence in consumer activity or the rates come down slightly. And as we mentioned earlier on the call in September -- August, September last year, we saw rates come down into the sixes and we saw an increase in activity. So we know there's a correlation between where rates are and what consumer behavior is going to be. John, you want to take the first one on margins? John Gamble : And USIS margins, again, it's very similar to Equifax margins, right? So we're absolutely seeing savings from the cost reduction from moving to the cloud that's driving improvement in margins. Our growth rate is lower in 2025 than in our long-term model. And obviously we have very high variable margins. So what we're seeing, right, is that with the growth rate higher inside the long-term model for USIS being 68%, you would see much larger margin expansion in terms of a percentage basis. One of the things we are fighting against, which we've all been talking about for quite some time, obviously we get some revenue lift from our mortgage supplier price increase, but it also is margin dilutive. So we can hold margins with our own price increases along with it, but it isn't really accretive to our margin profile because of the way the price increases pass through. So, beneficial on the revenue side, not beneficial on the margin percentage side, but beneficial on the margin dollar side. Arthur Truslove : Thank you. Just one follow-up from me, if it's okay. You're obviously forecasting margins down in workforce solutions, and you're saying part of that is bringing on TWN partners. Just give an idea of how many basis points bringing on the TWN partners costs and then whether that then comes back in subsequent years? Thank you. Mark Begor : Yes, this is onboarding costs. So it's one-time costs. We'll have incremental people involved, technology costs. It's just a little bit bigger than normal because we added 15 partners last year. So as I said, some of those second half additions are still being onboarded, so there's just additional activity. And yes, it does go away. I think there's just a larger amount now because of our success last year of adding partners, John, right? John Gamble : Yes. We pay incentives to partners to board faster, right? So as that happens, it ends up being margin dilutive in the period which it occurs. Arthur Truslove : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. George Tong : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. With respect to your margin outlook, can you elaborate on key drivers you have internally that could drive upside to your 2025 EBITDA margin guide, or would you say your outlook is relatively fixed given external conditions? John Gamble : Obviously, there's a lot of drivers internally on the way to drive revenue faster. The biggest ones Mark's already talked about, right, which is our ability to continue to drive more revenue growth, right? Obviously, our long-term margin expansion of 50 basis points a year is driven by the fact that we have extremely high variable margins across the vast majority of our product portfolio. So the faster we can, as we drive to introduce more products, new products faster, it drives incremental revenue benefit. As we continue to put more AI and ML into our products, it drives better scores, higher growth rates, more data contribution, and more data usage by our customers. So the biggest thing we can do is obviously drive revenue faster, and then we'll continue to work to drive down costs more rapidly. One of the ways we do that obviously is executing on our cloud migrations. As that occurs, we can continue to take out costs more quickly. As we execute those effectively, that'll drive costs out, and we'll continue to manage costs prudently as we go through 2025 and every year going forward. Mark Begor : The principal upside, I guess, George, is where you're going, the principal upside for our revenue margin EPS and free cash flow drive framework for 2025 is going to be what happens to mortgage and hiring markets. If they get better, we're not going to invest more costs from that margin expansion or revenue expansion. We're going to drop that through, and you've seen the impact that it's had on us from what you expected, meaning the street expected for 2025. It's quite substantial because they're all incremental margins. George Tong : Yes, makes a lot of sense. And then with respect to your cloud transformation savings, any color you could provide on the quarterly phasing of savings in 2025 and perhaps 2026? Mark Begor : Yes, I would think about them as much smaller. When you think about us being close to 85% in the cloud and the big increase like in USIS was a very substantial cloud completion. We got big savings from that in 2024 that also comp into 2025. They're going to be smaller. We haven't communicated what they are. When you think about Spain completing in the first quarter, for example, and some of the other completions we expect this year, those are in our guidance. So they're in our cost plans, what they're expected to be, but you shouldn't think about them as being anywhere near the magnitude of what you saw last year and actually in some of the prior years. George Tong : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our final question is from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Adam from Shlomo. Just one for me. What are you hearing from banks in terms of macro expectations and how the various areas of credit are performing? Thanks. Mark Begor : Yes, so I think broadly our customers, banks, fintechs, here and around the globe, with unemployment low and employment high, that's a positive. So that clearly is one is consumers are working, they generally get to pay their bills. I think we've seen that impact on inflation, which is still high in relative terms and impacting that subprime consumer. Their delinquencies have increased. So you've seen some already repositioning, if you will, around underwriting there and the level of capacity that principally fintechs want to take on. But you're still seeing very strong kind of focus in that space. The subprime players are focused on growing their originations there. And no real change on the broader set of the credit spectrum. And our customers are financially strong. When you think about the banks, the fintechs, you don't see issues there. The other piece of it is around consumer confidence and the impact of higher rates. I think we've talked ad nauseam around mortgage. We've seen an impact in auto where higher rates are either forcing consumers to buy used cars versus new or keep old cars and keep them on the road, meaning not buy that new car or that new used car. So there's clearly been an impact there from what we've seen in higher rates. But broadly, you may be stepping back. I don't think we see a change in '25 outside of call it mortgage in FI, which we've already talked about, the down 12. I don't think we see any real change in either customer behavior or consumer behavior as we go into 2025. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I will now turn the floor back to Trevor Burns for closing remarks. Trevor Burns : Thanks, everybody. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to Molly and myself. Otherwise, have a great day. Thank you. Operator : This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",
