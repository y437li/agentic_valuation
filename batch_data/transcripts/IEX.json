With that, I will now turn the call over to Andy Silvernail. Andy? Andy Silvernail : Thank you, good morning everybody. I appreciate you joining us here for our discussion on the first quarter results. Before I get into the results and the financials in the segments, I want to talk a little bit about how we\u2019re doing against our strategy. As you recall, we outlined three major strategic priorities that we\u2019re going to talk about here this morning. Accelerating organic growth, executing around our core customers and products and then really improving our capital deployment and then also I\u2019m going to take a few minutes and talk about what we\u2019re seeing around the world. Our first strategic priority -- last quarter, I took some time and mentioned that we seen a build in organic revenue, organic order growth and we\u2019re seeing that really play out here in the first quarter. We saw some buildup in the order rates at the end of 2013 and I\u2019m pleased to say that we delivered 8% organic growth in the quarter. We\u2019ve seen the benefits of focusing in on these segments, our core customers and our products that we\u2019ve been pulling more and more resources over the few years against. It\u2019s also important to note that of the 8% organic sales growth in the first quarter, it was lifted by about 4 points from the conversion of the large dispensing order that we had from the third quarter of last year. We originally thought that that order was going to happen balanced between the first and the second quarter. In reality the vast majority of it was pulled forward by our customer and that we shifted in the first quarter. So that certainly helped the first quarter organic growth rates. I\u2019m very proud of how the dispensing team did there. They executed flawlessly. We got a customer up and running and the team there was just thrilled with what they\u2019ve accomplished. Because what we\u2019re seeing in our ability to execute, we are raising the low end of our organic growth rate to 4% and we now estimate they will be about 4% to 5% to the full year and we\u2019re increasing our guidance because of this from 338 to 345. If you look at our second priority, which is executing around our core customers and products, this is a really good story. We\u2019ve seen that improvement and growth is really not so much due to markets but due to our execution. We\u2019ve had an internal mantra, make our own luck and we\u2019ve really done just that and for the few years we\u2019ve been segmenting our markets and our customers more deeply. We put more resources on our best opportunities and we\u2019ve really driven profit improvement in places that historically lag. The aggressive segmentation that we\u2019ve been doing has been supported very strong operational execution where we\u2019ve really focused to deliver value to our customers in terms of quality, reliability, and service. All these efforts really continue to drive very, very strong profitable growth with very strong high incremental flow through rates. And in the first quarter, we saw that come through at about 39% and flow through to the operating profit line. Our third priority is around capital deployment and really supporting the two priorities is fully funding our organic growth and our organic initiatives. And during 2013 and now continuing in 2014, we\u2019ve made a number of targeted investments to ensure that our platforms can continue to grow. We\u2019ve put money into people, channels, products, and operations and just a few examples that we talked about in the past, but I think are worth reinforcing, we\u2019re opening up a production facility to support our specialty seals business in Houston in the oil and gas markets. We\u2019re doubling the size of our India facility, which has had outstanding demand and this really supports multiple business lines. We\u2019ve been winning new business and market share in our Scientific Fluidics and our Ag platforms and also we\u2019ve had this really great story in our Fire Suppression business where we have one new business in power production facilities around the trailer business. We\u2019ve been able to fund these organic growth initiatives because we\u2019ve really had very, very good productivity and we expect that to continue in the future. After maximizing these organic growth investments, we said we\u2019re going to layout our strategy of putting money into strategic acquisitions first, share repurchases and dividends. And let me catch on the latter first. We increased our dividend rate by 22% here recently and we\u2019re very excited about the ability to continue to grow that dividend rate. We also continue our share repurchase program and we anticipate about a net 1% from this effort. And we\u2019re seeing an improvement in our overall M&A funnel. So although we didn\u2019t announce any deals in the first quarter, we are seeing some improvement in our M&A funnel and we feel good about 2014. Now let me take minute and just talk about what we\u2019re seeing around the world. In North America demand continues to be very positive. And also importantly, our short cycle businesses have demonstrated two consecutive quarters of nice expansion and that gives us some encouragement here as we head into the second quarter. China, which is on the forefront of everybody\u2019s mind, it\u2019s really -- continue to be choppy. We see growth one month and then slowdown in the next. And so while we\u2019re still very committed to that region, as I said in the past we\u2019re going to have leave with the volatility that\u2019s just inherent in that part of the world. Europe continues to have a positive trend and I expect that to continue unless something is blunted by what we\u2019re seeing in the activities in Eastern Europe. And then the emerging markets which really offer great opportunity -- it\u2019s very similar to the story in China, which is you have to be one to deliver the opportunity and make your bets over the very, very long term. So excellent long term prospects that I would say is in the last quarter or two. The growth has been slower frankly than in the developed world. Overall, the outlook is positive with a few pockets of concern. It\u2019s important to remember that in a primarily -- we have a short cycle business and so we don\u2019t have a lot of backlog to look forward into the year, but what we\u2019re seeing right now makes us feel pretty good. With that let me turn to our results. I\u2019m now on Slide 4. For the first quarter, we have revenue of $544 million is up 10%, 8% organically, which really an exceptional start to the year. Operating margins were 20.9% which is up 170 basis points year-over-year and this improvement is driven by a combination of productivity, volume leverage and also some good pretty mix across our platforms. The results that we\u2019ve highlighted and really been improved, we\u2019ve seen a great performance by our Fluid & Metering which had a 260 basis point improvement in margin and also had to diversify which had a 360 basis points expansion in margin. I\u2019ll get into that in a more in a second when we talk about the segments. But you know really outstanding results. We did see backlog decrease by about $7 million in the quarter but this was really due to finishing that dispensing order earlier than we thought and when you back that out, we still feel pretty good about where we stand in terms of backlog going into the second quarter. EPS was $0.91, which is up 23% from last year. With that let\u2019s turn to the segments. I am now on Slide 5. And we\u2019ll start with the discussion of Fluid & Metering. The first quarter results were very strong and really demonstrated a sustained growth in organic orders and sales which were up about 5%. Operating margins as I mentioned a moment ago, expanded by 260 basis points. We saw a combination of really very good productivity improvements in market growth. And especially this would have been led by energy and fuels platform and that team just continues to do a great job. If you look at energy and fuels they are two big items that really made the quarter for us. One is the strength of dealing in truck deals in the North America retrofits business. And second there was larger than anticipated fuel consumption as I extended winter played out and that really drove some activity in the end markets in the LPG area, around those OEMs. If you look at the water service business, that\u2019s another good story. Municipal spending continues to improve. We are seeing some improvement spend generally in those markets. The demand has been, pretty decent in the U.S. in Japan and Europe really around share gains more than anything else. But it\u2019s a good story there too. And that came really -- it continue to do a nice job of capturing share by offering tremendous service and a product part offering. In particular we\u2019ve seen a series of nice new products come out of that business and some excellent commercial execution. In the Ag world, the Banjo team continues to do a nice job. We are very aware of what\u2019s been happening in that external market. We said last quarter that we thought we had a pretty good view of how the year was going to play out based on making it through the first quarter. And we think we\u2019ll hit our numbers generally but we are aware of the softness that\u2019s out there and that team is certainly preparing contingencies and they really demonstrate the ability to execute with new products, entering new markets. So we feel pretty good about that. And also in our chemical Food & Process in in our diaphragm and dosing businesses, again solid quarter out of all those teams. Let\u2019s move now to Slide 6, to Health & Science, again solid overall growth. We had sales growth, orders are up about 6%, sales up 5% and we saw margins expand begin up 70 basis points to 19.4%. The benefits of the cost and actions from the fourth quarter, combined with very nice execution in order momentum at the end of 2013, really helped deliver nice quarter for HST. A few highlights here. Really two things stood out, Scientific Fluidics business and material process technologies. The Scientific Fluidics business has been on a role. They\u2019ve won consistently for five quarters with expanding orders of sales growth. It had improving markets generally, but even more importantly, they are grabbing share in markets that continue to be actually decent markets, but really nice job in new products type this year, new channels and an excellent geographic penetration. If you look at our material process technology business, that as you know is a little bit longer cycle business. Their order rates really picked up, as we have started looking at the end of last year and in this year, and that\u2019s going to convert in the second half of 2014. So that team did a nice job. The other parts of HST are also doing well, but I don\u2019t want to pick of those two highlights. All right, I am on our final segment, it\u2019s diversified, I\u2019m on Slide 7. Really just a great quarter. We had sales up 22%, driven principally by that large Dispensing order that we talked about. However, if you take that out, the Dispensing business still grew mid-single digits. So we are seeing nice core sales growth. And the operating margins for the whole segment increased by 360 basis points in the quarter. So really, really a nice job across the board. Again, if we look at Dispensing, even with that order taken out, we have seen that team did a nice job of filling their core business. The U.S. core business is expanding. Europe has picked up off the bottom there. So that\u2019s a good story. And also we\u2019ve seeing real strength in our X-SMART launch. As you recall the new product that we launched here a year or so ago has continued to gain traction. So really nice job across the board with the Dispensing team. The Fire Suppression group, the story here is really three things. Number one, continuity of benefits of the operational execution and facility consolidations we did here last here. Number two, nice wins in the emerging markets with our portables business. And then number three, as we talked about, really a whole new segment that they\u2019ve developed in the power production facilities with the trailer business. Finally our rescue business, that\u2019s actually is one business that been a little bit slow. We have seen tightness of money. And if we look in Asia and China in particular, there has been some tightness of money in terms of spend, on some large projects, and we were competing against some pretty tough comps here in the first quarter. But generally I feel very good that that team will see improvement here as we head into the second half. All right, we\u2019ll now turn to Slide 8, and let\u2019s talk about the second quarter and full year guidance. For the second quarter we think the EPS is going to be $0.85 to $0.87. Organic revenue growth will be about 4% and operating margins will be right around 20%. In Q2 we are expecting tax rate to pick up sequentially to above 30%. For the full year, as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re increasing our guidance to be in the range of 338 to 345, with organic revenue of approximately 4% to 5% for the full year. And again we expect operating margin to exceed 20%. As always, a few other modeling items just for you to consider. The full-year tax rate is anticipated to be 29% to 29.5%. Full-year CapEx around $40 million to $45 million and free cash flow will be somewhere between 120% and 125% of net income. As always, this includes any impact of acquisitions, either to the benefits or the costs. So with that, let me stop now and I will turn it over to the operator for any questions that you have. Operator : (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Robert W. Baird. Mike Halloran - Robert W. Baird:   On the corporate expense line, could you just go over why the spike in the quarter on the corporate expense line, if there is any diligence-related costs there, and then, what the right run rate looks like going forward? Heath Mitts : Mike, this is Heath. The spike in that number really comes from a couple of different things. One is some diligence-related activity for potential acquisitions in the future, is one driver. There were some legal costs that we booked, for both for that as well as for some environmental activity going on, and the third driver was compensation-related expense related to equity. So the run rate going forward, I would say run it out of the debt right around $18 million a quarter, it think is a good number. Mike Halloran - Robert W. Baird: And then, so flattish from where we were this quarter, maybe slightly down? Heath Mitts : Correct. Mike Halloran - Robert W. Baird: Okay. And then on the timing of the dispensing order, obviously in the prepared remarks you talked about how the majority of that was pulled in to the first quarter. Could you just help us talk about what the right run rate on the margin line looks there -- looks like there? It feels like you have stripped out a lot of the large orders and something kind of more standard run rate stuff from here, but a little help there would be great. Andy Silvernail : Let me -- I\u2019ll touch on a couple of things, perhaps you know; I\u2019ll let Heath talk a little bit more about the specifics on the margin. Two things really happened there on that order. Number one, the customer just came and said, can we accelerate this, and can we pull it forward, so we can have it in place for the holidays. Usually any of these large orders that come through, they want to be well in place before Memorial Day, and we had the supply chain and the capability to pull it forward and so we\u2019re able to do that. So that\u2019s kind of the number one. Number two, when you look at the fill of the base business, a good story there is we are seeing nice fill in the base business. So even though that large order -- our business -- we're going to have to scope the business downward after that large order goes, the fill rate has been pretty good, and that team did a great job of going into that order knowing that we had to have a very flexible model. So we didn\u2019t add any real fix costs to get that order out. What that means however, though is that -- there was a very high contribution margin, there\u2019s no doubt about it, right. Because we didn\u2019t add a lot of fix cost to that. And the strategy in that business now is to -- is around that highly flexible model that can scale up and down, as we see some of these bigger things. So that\u2019s kind of -- that\u2019s an overview of that order and we expect going forward [indiscernible]. Heath Mitts : For modeling purposes Mike, I would recommend using whatever you want to use for that segment\u2019s organic revenue growth. The flow through on that for the next few quarters will be in a 35% range. So depending on what you want to use for the organic revenue growth. So, yes, we\u2019re not going to run at 28% every quarter obviously with -- in a more normalized state, but we\u2019ll still be in the low to mid 20s -- mix plays in there as well. Mike Halloran - Robert W. Baird: No. That makes lot of sense. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then lastly, just want to understand the mechanics behind the guidance here. If I look at the full year guidance relative to where the first and the second quarter coming out, do your obviously looking on average at quarter run rates that are below what the 2Q median would look like, if I can comment what your second quarter guidance. So maybe you could just talk about some of the puts and takes as we move to the second half of the year, whether there are some demand concerns, it doesn\u2019t sound it, mix pressures or any kind of one off type things that are rolling through? Andy Silvernail : Our view on the second half really hasn\u2019t changed much, if you just kind of think about the underlying business. What I\u2019d say is -- the guidance in terms of both organic growth rate and where we\u2019re taking it up have to do with pulling that one order forward and then seeing work on modest base improvement and that\u2019s why we took the bottom end of it up. And so, if you look at it how the guidance forms, it\u2019s really based on looking at a 4% organic in the back half of the year, and so it\u2019s not really weaker than the first half here, except that you don\u2019t have the larger, that one larger order in there. So that\u2019s the mechanic, if I thought about it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Nathan Jones - Stifel: If I could focus in a little bit on the SMP orders, there has been, over the last couple of quarters very little organic growth there. Can you provide some more color on, kind of, what\u2019s holding that down a little bit? Andy Silvernail : You know, we\u2019re not really worried about that. Those things can be a little bit more lumpy depending upon where we are. The first quarter of last year was very strong, if you recall the order book of first quarter of last year. And the book to bill is still very, very solid. So we\u2019re not particularly worried about that. The -- as we look at the pipeline that\u2019s coming through the funnel, the order rates, I would say they are definitely going to end the year in that 4% to 5% range. Nathan Jones - Stifel: In the 4% to 5% organic revenue growth range? Andy Silvernail :  Yeah. Somewhere in that range. Nathan Jones - Stifel: Okay. So roughly in line with where you were in the first quarter for the year? Andy Silvernail : Yeah. There\u2019s no reason, if we look at our order book going into the second quarter, like all of our business, we don\u2019t carry a lot of backlog, but the pieces that we have good visibility to have been -- we feel comfortable with. The other thing that makes us a feel little more comfortable is, the really short cycles. So the book and churn business, the day rate business that\u2019s coming out of U.S. distribution, as everyone knows on the call that\u2019s something that can be a little bit lumpy. And we have seen that steady out over the last couple of quarters. So that gives us some confidence too. Nathan Jones - Stifel: Make sense. On the other hand, you have seen some quite significant improvement in orders in the HST business. Should we expect to that manifest as accelerating growth as we go through the year? Andy Silvernail : No, I think, what -- if you see there -- if you parse it out, if you look at scientific fluidics, optic and photonics and sealing, those are kind of right in line with what we\u2019ve seen -- what we\u2019ve seen and what we had expected. And the real variance here has been some really strong bookings at a material process technology. And that will ship in a back half of the year and even some into the first quarter of next year. Nathan Jones - Stifel: So we should maybe see a little bit to better growth in the second half? Andy Silvernail : Well, yes, it the material process technology but they had a pretty weak fourth quarter last year. That was pretty soft. So they\u2019ll feel that in. And the other pieces I think will hold steady. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Jefferies. Scott Graham - Jefferies: Hey. So I wanted to may be ask previous question a different way. I think you answered sort of a full year guidance question, relative to organic growth. And I just maybe want to, hoping that you would add on the earnings growth side, because the top end of your EPS guidance, start to put the numbers together, it looks like fairly meaningful slowdown in earnings growth that you\u2019re expecting for the second half of the year. And maybe its conservatism and I think we all certainly get that but, it\u2019s a pretty meaningful step down. So I was hoping you can give us some color on that? Andy Silvernail : We had incrementals coming out of the dispensing order here in the first quarter right. We would still expect to deliver at the kind of rates that we\u2019ve always communicated, because we\u2019re kind of seeing you know, productivity and what not. I would say that there\u2019s a little bit of conservatism on a margin rate. We do also have -- you remember last year in the fourth quarter we only had 25% tax rate, and that\u2019s going to be more in that 29 to 30 range. So we had some pretty discrete items. I can let Heath talk to it. But that\u2019s going to hit that a little bit. And also we continue to make reinvestments and either the way I look at it is we want to continue to reinvest in our businesses aggressively, and we\u2019re at a position where we have an opportunity to do that. Heath, anything you want to talk about in the margins. Heath Mitts :  No, I would say, we will reserve the right to adjust the 90 days as we see appropriate, but given amount of backlog that we hold formally and where we see things, we want to make sure that we\u2019re cautious in terms of our outlook in second half. Scott Graham - Jefferies: The second question is simple. You guys in the press release and in your statements here have been a little bit more upbeat on the acquisition pipeline than you have been in quite some time, as I remember. So I was just kind of wondering, Andy, if you can give us a little bit more on why that incremental plus, and are you -- do you think you're getting closer to the finish line on a couple? Is it things in the $50 million to $100 million variety, below that, above that? Anything you can give us would be helpful, thanks. Andy Silvernail : The improvement is really, I guess the more upbeat tone -- it is not because we have anything big that\u2019s imminent - that\u2019s going to drop tomorrow or anything like that that's substantive. But it's more of -- we started putting more resources into our platforms for business development starting about 18 months ago. And what we\u2019re seeing happen Scott, is just an improvement of funnel from, frankly more feet on the street and an improvement in cultivation. And so if we put together a combined strategy of putting more feet out there, closer to the marketplace, really still looking around this $25 million to $200 million range, that sweet spot. There are a few bigger things out there that we\u2019re looking at, but our sweet spot continues to be in that range. And then the second part, as a number of you know, we started building an acquisition integration team here also about that same time. And we feel like we have the capacity to start to move that ball a little faster. That being said, as everyone knows, right these things, right down to the finish line, they can fall through or they can come through. And so in the last year or so we\u2019ve had a number of things that we got to the finish line on and didn\u2019t happen. And as we look at the balance of 2014, we have a little bit better funnel and hopefully we\u2019ll start to see some more activity. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak-Cusic with Wells Fargo Securities Allison Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities : Just following on that comment in terms of Scott\u2019s comment on the M&A side, is there any specific area where you guys feel like you\u2019re more weighted in the funnel at this point? Maybe segment oriented? Andy Silvernail : It\u2019s actually, it\u2019s pretty balanced between FMT and HST. The places that we have set are going to be our priorities around in FMT have been around energy and the chemical area. It\u2019s been an area of focus. And we consistently said that we wanted to build out around agriculture, although that\u2019s been a tough one over the last few years to do. So those were the kind of the three areas in FMT. When you look at HST, scientific fluidics, optics and photonics, and seals really have been our areas of focus. And so those are the areas that we\u2019re really putting the most energy on. And it really gives us Allison, the ability to arbitrage the market a little bit, as multiples kind of move one way or the other in any one of those segments. We can, even when the market is moving and it has been as strong as it\u2019s been can hopefully put ourselves into a position where we can buy at little bit better multiples than are out there, kind of generally in the marketplace. Allison Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities : That's great. And then, just in terms of the end markets, it sounded like you were certainly a lot more positive in certain lines. Is there any more that's maybe moving the other way or could be that you are concerned about, or is it just more geographically focused in that respect? Andy Silvernail : I see two things, one of each. The first one is on the Ag side. I think we have not experienced the slowdown yet that kind of everybody is worried about. We saw some overall commodity prices improved a little bit and therefore net farm income, just modestly recently. At the same time, the drought in California hasn't helped anybody. There is no doubt about that and so, I\u2019m cautious about that one but at the same time I feel very, very good about the team that we have there, and their ability to grow organically in and out of the cycle. So that\u2019s I guess one. The other one is, I still -- and I\u2019ve said this for the last few quarters. I\u2019m tepid on what's going on in China. That\u2019s been pretty volatile, and we have seen that unevenness of business here for quite sometime and so I have some concern around that. We\u2019re still investing in we\u2019re going to continue to invest because they are very important markets to us, but we have to be willing to live with the volatility there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt McConnell with Citi Research. Matt McConnell - Citi Research : Just on the second-quarter guidance, you are assuming a little bit of a margin step down, one. I know the trend would normally be for that to go up just a little bit. Is that exclusive to the Fire Safety and Diversified segment? Andy Silvernail : Yes, and really exclusive to the incremental margins of the dispensing order, right. And that\u2019s a big number and that came through at nice incremental margins because of the nature of the very flexible model they put in place. And also you\u2019re going to see tax rate creep up a little bit here in the second quarter. Matt McConnell - Citi Research : Okay. Even like in FMT, the margin was nice, above 25%, but that wouldn\u2019t be part of the sequential compression? Andy Silvernail : Really, if you look at generally around FMT and HST, the only times you see kind of those big swings quarter-to-quarter are typically due to mix, right. And now that water has improved its overall margin profile. The real mover on there tends to be Ag, because Banjo has some seasonality to it and is pretty high incremental margins, so that\u2019s where you\u2019d see the move quarter-to-quarter. Over in HST the margin on an incremental basis is pretty consistent through those businesses. So you generally it\u2019s going to more follow volume and then occasionally depending upon your ability, you might win few projects here and there specifically around Material Process technology that might shift mix slightly. Matt McConnell - Citi Research : Okay, great. And switching gears just a little bit, on some of the growth investments that you highlighted at the start of the call, and we\u2019ve been hearing on the floor, maybe a year or six quarters, what\u2019s the lead time in when those actually drive incremental sales? Like is there a way to quantify what you\u2019re seeing out of those investments? Like where are you in the process of the investments translating to incremental revenue? Andy Silvernail : So, there are some things that take a really long time to gestate. So as an example, if you just look at the product development lifecycles in HST as an example, you tend to see -- that\u2019s a long gestation period. That can be two to three years frankly. When you look at the channel related things, that can be a year and so some of the channel related activity that we\u2019ve done in diversified and some of the channel related activity that we\u2019ve done in FMT, we\u2019re definitely seeing benefits of. I can give a couple of examples I think in our water business as an example. We restructured that business and we didn\u2019t put incremental resources in there, but we certainly aggressively segmented and move resources. And some of the growth that we\u2019ve seen in new product and in new areas of business have been attributed to that and then in FMT we\u2019ve been very aggressive about moving resources into the Middle East and also into Asia specifically for our rector business and those are things that have had faster gestation than say that two or three year of period, but I\u2019d say on average it\u2019s kind of 12 to 18 months. And we are seeing a little of now, there is no doubt. We\u2019re seeing a little bit of it now and I would say as we get into the backend of this year more importantly into 2015, I\u2019m hoping that we see more benefits. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with KeyBanc. Matt Summerville - KeyBanc: First, Andy, with respect to your municipal-oriented business and pertaining to water, are you seeing a step-function improvement in that business? Are you seeing loosening of capital budgets or just mandatory stuff that has been delayed so long it just has to get done? Andy Silvernail : There is definitely more money out there. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s not. The floodgates haven\u2019t opened up, but I will say I think the money -- the municipal monies have come probably six months quicker than I\u2019ve thought they were going to. As you know on the last couple of calls I\u2019ve said that it was kind of 12 to 18 month cycle from when they see improvements in tax receipts to budget increases. And we\u2019re seeing that little bit faster I think. So there is some loosening of purse strings. And then it kind of relates some of the things that have been on the shelf here really since the financial crisis. There is probably some pent-up demand that\u2019s out there. I don\u2019t want to overstate it though. It\u2019s not a huge number, but it is improvement definitely. On the European side, that\u2019s really been more about new products and some share shift. And so it really is bifurcated between what I\u2019ll call a true improving in market in the U.S. and in Europe where we\u2019ve just executed better I think and had some nice new products. Matt Summerville - KeyBanc: Just another follow-up just on the M&A environment as you guys see it. If you look across FMT and HST, what would you say right now in your funnel would be the average type of EBITDA multiples you are looking at? Andy Silvernail : Average is a tough one, Matt. And the reason I say that is and I\u2019ll give you -- how about I give you a range? I\u2019m going to say 7 to 10 is kind of the range and it really kind of depends on the situation. As you know, getting to that 10 size, you got to really clearly understand how you\u2019re going to drive value pretty quickly. But I\u2019d say generally it\u2019s kind of - if I were to tighten that range it\u2019s kind of 8 to 9. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Knight with Janney Capital Markets. Paul Knight - Janney Capital Markets : The health and science segment, is it chromatography, is it the broader strength in the market, what\u2019s behind the five quarters in a row of the improved order rate? Andy Silvernail : Three things, number one the market generally has improved. So the analytic range for market driven by I\u2019d say improvements in you see pressure come off from the NIH spending. You\u2019ve seen some improvement in capital spend from a number of our customers in some geographic improvements. So I\u2019d a piece of its market. A second piece of it is around, you are seeing definitely a new product cycle. This is an industry, whether it\u2019s the analytical instrument or the diagnostics industry, you\u2019re seeing some improvement. You will see kind of a two to three year product cycles and we are in the midst of the start of a new product cycle that will last couple of years. So that\u2019s a piece of it. And then the final part is there is real growth around in the biotech side, in the genome sequencing. That\u2019s the piece of the business that\u2019s improving. And then I guess the last entity is I think we are winning share. As I look at what we\u2019re doing on new platforms that are being launched and the dollars per instrument that we\u2019re associated with, we\u2019re seeing that improve. Paul Knight - Janney Capital Markets : And what are your thoughts about acquisitions in the area where you are more directly interfacing with the end market instead of the OEM world? Andy Silvernail : We don\u2019t want to compete with our good customers. That\u2019s not something we want to do. We\u2019re really-really comfortable in the component and the subsystem area, and then in the instrument area where, frankly it\u2019s really a component of a larger process. So we\u2019re not going to move, you\u2019re not going to see us move aggressively up market and compete with our customers. Operator :  Our next question comes from the line of Charley Brady with BMO Capital. Charley Brady - BMO Capital : Just on FMT, and kind of I just want to go back to the organic growth outlook to make sure I understand it here, because you are facing a couple quarters here in terms of the orders, pretty tough comps from second quarter, third quarter last year going into second and third quarter this year, and you did 1% this year. You did minus 1% in Q4. Is the 5% organic growth rate here in the first quarter -- was that longer lead stuff that was driving that, because in my mind I would have thought that some of the more near-term, last quarter, fourth quarter, order numbers would have fed into this quarter a little bit more, maybe the organic growth rate wouldn't have been that high, and I guess I'm trying to square that up with your organic outlook going forward, given that orders are -- unless you are thinking that orders are really going to match the pace of a year ago and I'm missing something, it sounds like that\u2019s going to tick down at least for a couple quarters. Andy Silvernail : Really if you look at it, part of it is comps. I\u2019m talking of the first half of the year, its comps. We did have some stuff, there was a little bit longer cycle, that came out. At the same time last year we saw some of our leaders and some of the businesses that had historically not been leaders in that area, and our expectation is some of our bigger brands, our Viking, our Warren Rupp brands, that didn\u2019t have really great second halves last year. Because if you look at their order book, are poised to do pretty well and have some of that facing related to the U.S. industrial markets that we\u2019ve seen improve. And so at same time, I think the water business is continuing to sequentially improve, and we don\u2019t see a big downside in Ag yet. So that\u2019s what gives us a level confidence that for the year we\u2019ll end up with sales that are in that kind of 4% to 5% -- 3% to 5% range. Charley Brady - BMO Capital : Can you remind us how much Ag is of FMT? Andy Silvernail : It\u2019s around 12% -- 10% to 12%. And it\u2019s the one-piece that moves kind of quarter-to-quarter in a meaningful way. Operator : Your next question comes from Joseph Giordano with Cowen. Joseph Giordano - Cowen: I just wanted to ask a question on FMT real quick, on the margin expansion there. How would you categorize that mix versus volume? Andy Silvernail : You know, a good piece of it was volume, but more importantly I think -- I'm going to call productivity. FMT has done a really, really good job over the last year here of improving overall productivity. And some of our bigger places, our bigger engines, I\u2019ll use to Viking as the example, have done a nice job of driving activity through their entire value chain. So you see that happening. The other part is that the water business, we\u2019re still -- we\u2019re just starting to -- at the back half of the year we\u2019ll finally lap the improvement that we\u2019re seeing there. And that\u2019s been a really meaningful shift, in terms of overall profitability. So it\u2019s not so much, just generally the volume, although the volume helps. We had nice incremental margins there. But specifically, I would hang my hat on productivity, number one. And number two, we\u2019re still seeing the nice comparables for our water business. Joseph Giordano - Cowen: So I guess that kind of leads into the next question, then. You guys have been successful with productivity for a bit now, so how would you say that success has maybe changed your view on portfolio potential overall, ex-M&A, going forward? Andy Silvernail : We have said even back a year or so ago, we have said that we thought this was business that could to the low 20s in operating profit, and I would say that our confidence is rising that we can over the next two, three, four, five years, there is more headroom to that than maybe we thought and part of it right is having that sense of what is the full potential of your businesses and even if a business is very profitable how do you continue to drive that and segmentation played a big role in that and you more aggressively segment within a platform with a business, even within a product line, and you really start to feed the winners and frankly starve the losers. You can see a nice overall improvement in your profitability and growth rates. Joseph Giordano - Cowen: So I mean, is -- not for a near term, but do you guys think if you stay on this path, you can get to something like a 25% without M&A as markets improve and you guys continue to invest the way you are investing? Andy Silvernail : It\u2019s too early to make that call. If we get consistently into the low 20s, I think we can rethink that then. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Walter Liptak with Global Hunter. Walter Liptak - Global Hunter : I wanted to ask just a follow-on on the dispensing business and maybe you can provide some color on just what inning do you think we are in the cycle for customer refresh, slow refresh? And I guess based on the guidance, we\u2019re not expecting another big order this year, but I wonder if you could tell us what you heard from your customers? Andy Silvernail : Yes, I\u2019d actually break this into two pieces, Wal. First one is on the refresh what we tend to see is every two-three years, we tend to see that cycle happen. The last couple of years, that\u2019s been compressed because it got held off few years before that. So we\u2019re not expecting to see these mega orders so to speak over the next year to 18 months. Our planning as we look at that and it does not anticipate having any of these north of $20 million orders, we don\u2019t expect that. At the same time, I would say that the base business across the globe has improved. In the U.S. and in Europe it is fundamentally I think a better overall environment for the business. And in Asia, it\u2019s really around the initiative that we have been driving frankly with new product development. Walter Liptak - Global Hunter : Okay. Is there a growth rate that we can put on this business now? I guess especially on the seals business? Andy Silvernail : I think it\u2019s much more consistent with kind of the IDEX overall growth rate. it is as we work through the next two-three years, I guess I\u2019d be disappointed if the core business minus backing out these big projects. It should grow in that 4% to 5% rate. Walter Liptak - Global Hunter : Okay. Good. And then, just switching gears to your energy products and FMT, can you provide some more color on what you are seeing in that market, MRO, versus capital spending plans, for next year? Andy Silvernail : I think a couple of things. One, very specific to some of the uptick that we\u2019ve experienced has to do with strength in North American market that we\u2019ve had generally and some of that has to do with a truck refresh and some of it has to do frankly with a really cold winter. And so there are couple of discreet items in there, much more importantly what we\u2019re really excited about is and the money that\u2019s moving into the energy sector now today is really about distribution. And the issue you have is where energy is produced and where it\u2019s consumed. There is a big disconnect because of the mix of energy and we sit really nicely in that area of this midstream that we think we can take advantage of and really be a player in there. So we think that there is some legs to this and it\u2019s not as violate as some of the upstream and downstream stuff. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Kipp with Janney Capital Markets. Bryan Kipp - Janney Capital Markets : Hi, Paul and I just got double-booked, so I appreciate all the color today. Andy Silvernail : No problem, Bryan. We all set. Good. Thank you all for joining us. We appreciate your interest in IDEX. Obviously, we\u2019re very happy with how the first quarter turned out and we are looking forward to a good year here. I guess the thing I\u2019d end with that I think the success that we\u2019re having is really attributable to the teams that we\u2019re building here at IDEX and I\u2019m very proud of what they\u2019re accomplishing and what they have accomplished and what we have to look forward to. So, I would like to thank the IDEX team for really an outstanding quarter and positive future here. So, thank you very much for joining us. We look forward to talking to you in the next quarter. Take care. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect.",

With that I\u2019ll turn our call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Andy Silvernail. Andrew K. Silvernail: Thanks Mike. And I appreciate everybody joining us here this morning for our second quarter call and results. Before I get into the result, as Mike said I\u2019m just going to take a minute and talk about how are doing our strategic priorities that we\u2019ve outlined here throughout this year and we\u2019re really going to talk about the three things in matter to us most. Number one is driving organic growth around our core customers in our core products, focused execution around that constituency and also very discipline capital deployment. So first, let me talk about organic growth, really nice story here in the first half of the year. We had 7% organic order growth in the second quarter and 4% organic sales growth and for the first half of the year were up about 6% year-on-year from an organic growth at top line. And I think the teams have done a very nice job ability momentum, as we look at the top line capabilities. There are really three things that are driving our improvement organic growth. The first one is very deep market customer and product segmentation, we were driving that that the most attractive growth opportunities and the most attractive profit-pools. The second is the deep product line strategy and what we were really looking here product line-by-product line how do we drive a relative competitive advantage and focus on the applications where we can develop the unique solution for a difficult customer problem. And then finally, it\u2019s about \u2013 it\u2019s about allocation, so smart people capital and operating expense allocation around those critical priorities in the most attractive opportunities. And internally and externally we\u2019ve talked a lot about the idea of making our own walk-in, and that\u2019s how this is about \u2013 this is about moving resources and people to the things where we think we can differentiate the most, and what we can drive organic growth. The bottom line as I think that the markets continue to be challenge out there in the world and we\u2019re not going to wait for some external tailwind. In the second, I\u2019m going to take some time and talk about some of the smart investments, so I think we\u2019re making this driving some other results, but I think of note you know we spent $23 million of capital this year through one half of the year, where last year we spent $32 million for the whole year. And it is driving results and we\u2019re raising our overall growth estimate we believe we\u2019ll commented about 5% to 6% in organic growth this year, and we\u2019re also raising our EPS estimate and we believe, we\u2019ll finish in 350 range to 355 range. Our second priority is really executing near around these core customers and core products. And for me execution is a really about building a culture and it\u2019s building a culture of trust where you are making and keeping promises for your customers, for your shareholders and also for your people internally. And that in and of itself is the first pillar to organic growth and we talk internally about earning the right to grow and when we drive down lead times we improved quality, we improved overall cost position, we put ourselves in a nice competitive situation and in a nice situation to continue to expand profitability. And in the second quarter you saw operating flow \u2013 through operating profit flow through a 44% that was up from the 39% flow through in the first quarter and was also 130 basis point improvement for the year. So I think a real nice example by executing on that strategy. Our final strategic priority is very distilled to capital deployment, and I spoke a moment ago about first choice of capital deployment is about driving organic growth, because returns are outstanding, the hit rate are very and I just wanted to take a second and just talk about some example of where we are making some investment at last year, this year and how they are paying off. One of those examples is in our Viking a business out in Cedar Falls, Iowa. They\u2019ve done a very, very nice job of making investment R&D capabilities for new products and in adjacent markets and we are starting to see some benefits of that now and we think we\u2019ll see some very nice benefits in 2015 and beyond. We\u2019ve also made tooling and equipment purchases across the business, but I think two that are particularly interesting one was for dispensing business where we made investment in laser automated sheet metal cutters and well that may mundane, what it does is it tremendously increases efficiency for that business, it allows us to meet some of the exceptional demand that\u2019s been out there and it also really drives down lead time and again kind of back to that story of execution it allows us to do that. In our Scientific Fluidics business, we've just recently expanded our 3D printing capability around rapid prototyping and so as you know in this business so much of it is about getting on new programs that will launch two or three years from and there is a critical pieces of that new product cycles where you have to turn around prototypes very, very quickly and we have some customer, because of their exceptional growth rates who need rapid prototyping and we\u2019re able to take that from weeks to literally days with 3D printing capabilities. We've also continue to make investment in our Fire Suppression business, one of the great success story this year and I\u2019ll talk about it in a minute is trailer business and we have made R&D capabilities, production capabilities and technology investments that paid have off. And finally, we continue to invest commercially in the Middle East and Latin America and we are expanding our commercial operations and we\u2019re seeing benefit throughout the business. So I think all of those investments, they put us in a position to grow now and to grow into the future and then we kind of get into our other capital choices. As an example, we took our dividend up in the first quarter 22% to $0.20 a share; one will continue to pay out about 30% of our net income to dividends. We\u2019ve also continued our share repurchase plan, we should net it out at about 1% this year from those efforts and we continue to pursue M&A opportunities. It\u2019s a very active environment out there, I think as you all know valuation remain pretty high, but we've maintained a very solid funnel and I would say we\u2019ve got five or six things at year end, pretty a late stage discussion that we\u2019re having, but it\u2019s a unique environment, because its definitely sellers market and you got to be smart of a high deployed your capital in M&A. We did close on the Aegis acquisition here in April, and this is really on our chemical and petrochemical industries in the Gulf of Mexico. Aegis is based Baton Rouge and that we\u2019ve already started investments to expand the business we\u2019re going to open up our facility in Houston and really it\u2019s about being close to your customers for a very quick turnarounds in product development and in excellence in service and supply. Let me just take a second now and talk about what we\u2019re seeing around the world now get into the specific results for the quarter. A few observations that we had North America, demand continues to be positive especially in our short-cycle industrial businesses and that we haven\u2019t seen any indication of a slowdown in the U.S. so we feel about the second half. China, the word we\u2019re using is uninspiring it\u2019s been also here for over a year and so we still growing, but it is much slower than we would want and we think about those we\u2019re going to continue through the second half of the year. However, we need to be in that region it\u2019s an important piece of business force we\u2019re going to live with the volatility and we\u2019re going to take continue to invest. Europe is a good trend still it continues to be positive particularly in Western Europe and the Northern part of the region that said we have start to see some impact from what some of the things that are going on in the Eastern part of the continent and we\u2019re mindful that. We don\u2019t have a lot of business in Russia or that goes into the Ukraine but we\u2019re mindful about the business that we do have. And we\u2019re also mindful about how that could cause issue throughout the rest of the regions. So overall, I feel good about the quarter, I think the outlook is stable in a few pockets of concern and I think we\u2019ve got really nice momentum going into the second half of the year. All right, let me switch gears here and talk about the second quarter results on Slide 4, as I said before organic orders were up 7% and we build about $5 million of backlog coming into the third quarter. Revenue was at $547 million or 5% and or 4% organically, operating margins were at 20.5% and 130 basis points expansion over the last year and we saw the improvements really coming from productivity and our ability to leverage some volume, but a lot of it is just coming from complexity reduction, waste elimination in our ability to execute for our customers. Free cash flow that was down from last year, but we still delivered over 100% free cash flow conversion, a couple of things that we\u2019re \u2013 that I think of note. Number one, as I mentioned before we have increased our overall organic investments here in the first half of the year. And it was some timing of payments in terms of tax and pension that fell in different point of last year. So frankly, it was a pretty difficult comp here in the second quarter. As I said before EPS was $0.88, up 16% from last year and that were pretty happy with the second quarter results and how we finish the first half of the year. All right, let me turn to the segment discussion I want Slide 5 and we\u2019ll start with Fluid & Metering. So the second quarter is really highlighted by 3% organic growth \u2013 order growth contributing to a pretty healthy backlog as we look into the third quarter. The disappointment was organic sales growth it was down 2% in the quarter. Although, we did, we knew some pretty difficult comps coming into it specifically in the chemical and the energy businesses, where we had some pretty large projects last year. And we had some demand volatility in that the \u2013 as you look at the second quarter about this year. The chemical projects that are down in 2014 as some business is get launched and get standard, we see picking backup in 2015, so we feel comfortable with that. And as I did mentioned before, I was talking about eastern part Europe. But as you all know there has been some volatility here, a lot of volatility in the Middle East and that has impacted some businesses going into a rack and some of that business has been pushed we think into the second quarter. So, what we did have a weak second quarter in terms of our sales growth, we feel very good about the second half and let me talk about that for a second. Number one, we\u2019ve had a pretty solid order growth here year-over-year. We know we had a difficult comparison in the second quarter those comparisons get easier, as we move into the back half of the year for SMP, in the sales funnel is pretty solid. So, as we look at the back half of the year, we feel good about delivering organic growth for the back half, but also for the year as a whole.  \u2013 : So, you can kind of pick any level and they\u2019ve does done a nice job of appoint those levels. The Ag business, this is Banjo and we call it Ag Banjo they kind of hand in hand. The reality is that business is about 30% industrial and about 40% of the overall business is closing for the aftermarket that business has continue to hold up as we go through the second quarter. We do expect some level of slowdown in the back half in 2015, but they\u2019re still doing a nice job of executing. We are very mindful of our farm incomes have gone and what some of the large customers are saying to build into our plans and we feel comfortable that will be successful in that business. Let me turn now to Slide 6 and we will talk about Health & Science. We had pretty solid second quarter with organic order growth of 5%, we had 1% organic sales growth and we improved margins by about 40 basis points over the last year. We\u2019ve had consecutive quarters of order growth and we feel again, just like the SMT feel real good about what the second half looks like and we think the second half will exceed the first half, in terms of growth rates. One of the \u2013 there are really two highlights in the second quarter for HST, our industrial businesses and then optics and photonics. And let me talk about optics and photonics first. Very nice order rebound for that business, life sciences, industrial and semiconductor markets were all up, very nice profitability expansion, cost side actions that we've taken are really now turning into some of the profit expansion that we expected and the team there again is doing a really nice job of executing. For the balance of the year, we think the markets look good and we continue to see a nice performance out of that team. In our industrial businesses it\u2019s really a story about new products in entrance into new markets and our Micropump and Gast brands have done a very nice job on both of those fronts and I think for products in particular they\u2019re doing a great job of penetrating markets and taking share. I guess one of the lowlights for the quarter, Scientific Fluidics after 18-months of really strong growth, we did see that slow here in the second quarter, there had been a very strong new product cycle and growth cycle out of that business and I think some inventory got built up and we\u2019re starting to see some headwinds from that. We've poked very hard to make sure that we haven\u2019t lost share and I\u2019m very confident that we have not, and as I look at the new product funnel, our customers launching, what they are launching and where we have content-per-platform, we feel very good about that business. So I think it\u2019s a short-term road bump, I do think we\u2019ll have some headwinds for a quarter or two, working through that but overall that business continuous to be a great business. Finally on our material process, as you all know that\u2019s a little bit longer cycle, we've had really nice order growth here for about a year and that\u2019s starting to turn into sales growth and we\u2019ll certainly see that in the back half of the year. All right, I\u2019m on my final segment diversified and that\u2019s on Slide 7. Outstanding performance, orders and sales were up 17% and Dispensing and BAND-IT led the way, but also as I\u2019ll talk about in a second rescue had a terrific order quarter. Operating margins improved by 570 basis points, a lot of volume leverage and very, very good productivity and also an easy comp, we had a charge last year for facility disposal that we of course didn\u2019t have this year, but either way a great profit execution. The dispensing team they\u2019ve done a very nice job of filling their backlog, as you all know, we\u2019re coming off of a very large project that we shift in the first quarter, but they continue to grow across the globe, North America and Europe are performing well, and even turmoil in Asia as you know we launched that X-Smart product and that\u2019s been real winner for us in the emerging markets. And we think that are going continue to take share and they\u2019re going to have some difficult comps are being go into next year, but at the same time they\u2019re well-positioned. I mentioned the Fire Suppression group and the trailers that\u2019s really for the power industry after the nuclear industry and they\u2019re growing that business nicely, but also projects towards in China they\u2019ve done a nice job of moving resources from the western part of the world to the eastern part of the world and they started to see some project orders in that business and we\u2019re going to continue to invest there by the way and really leverage our rescue platform for that business. Rescue as I mentioned they had a very strong order growth here in third quarter \u2013 there was pretty week last couple of quarters for sales growth for rescue that picked up from an order perspective in the second quarter and that will play itself through in the second half of the year. Our Band-It they are just continued to execute and get it done. If you look across transportation energy or cable management our order growth has been strong and we expect that to payoff here into the second half of the year. So the teams done a wonderful job, Eric Ashleman who leads that businesses has really done terrific job for us and we are seeing nice profitable growth from diversified. All right, let\u2019s move to the Q3 and to full-year 2014 guidance. I\u2019m going to start from the top of the Page and it\u2019s on Slide 8 and we\u2019ll just work our way down. We think EPS for the third quarter will be $0.83 to $0.85 and operating margin will be just about 20% and tax rate should come in around 30% for the quarter. For the full year as I mentioned before work we\u2019ve increased our guidance we are now guiding 350 or 355 and we think organic for sales for the year will be 5% to 6%. Full year operating margin should exceed 20% and then let me just give you a few other model and I don\u2019t see that to build in. We think tax rate is going to be 29% to 29.5% for the full-year. CapEx will be up we think it will be about $45 million to $50 million for the year and free cash flow will still come in and we think it at 120% of net income. As always any impact of acquisitions isn\u2019t affected into the guidance, but otherwise let me stop here and Jessie, I will turn it over to you. Let\u2019s open it for questions. : So, you can kind of pick any level and they\u2019ve does done a nice job of appoint those levels. The Ag business, this is Banjo and we call it Ag Banjo they kind of hand in hand. The reality is that business is about 30% industrial and about 40% of the overall business is closing for the aftermarket that business has continue to hold up as we go through the second quarter. We do expect some level of slowdown in the back half in 2015, but they\u2019re still doing a nice job of executing. We are very mindful of our farm incomes have gone and what some of the large customers are saying to build into our plans and we feel comfortable that will be successful in that business. Let me turn now to Slide 6 and we will talk about Health & Science. We had pretty solid second quarter with organic order growth of 5%, we had 1% organic sales growth and we improved margins by about 40 basis points over the last year. We\u2019ve had consecutive quarters of order growth and we feel again, just like the SMT feel real good about what the second half looks like and we think the second half will exceed the first half, in terms of growth rates. One of the \u2013 there are really two highlights in the second quarter for HST, our industrial businesses and then optics and photonics. And let me talk about optics and photonics first. Very nice order rebound for that business, life sciences, industrial and semiconductor markets were all up, very nice profitability expansion, cost side actions that we've taken are really now turning into some of the profit expansion that we expected and the team there again is doing a really nice job of executing. For the balance of the year, we think the markets look good and we continue to see a nice performance out of that team. In our industrial businesses it\u2019s really a story about new products in entrance into new markets and our Micropump and Gast brands have done a very nice job on both of those fronts and I think for products in particular they\u2019re doing a great job of penetrating markets and taking share. I guess one of the lowlights for the quarter, Scientific Fluidics after 18-months of really strong growth, we did see that slow here in the second quarter, there had been a very strong new product cycle and growth cycle out of that business and I think some inventory got built up and we\u2019re starting to see some headwinds from that. We've poked very hard to make sure that we haven\u2019t lost share and I\u2019m very confident that we have not, and as I look at the new product funnel, our customers launching, what they are launching and where we have content-per-platform, we feel very good about that business. So I think it\u2019s a short-term road bump, I do think we\u2019ll have some headwinds for a quarter or two, working through that but overall that business continuous to be a great business. Finally on our material process, as you all know that\u2019s a little bit longer cycle, we've had really nice order growth here for about a year and that\u2019s starting to turn into sales growth and we\u2019ll certainly see that in the back half of the year. All right, I\u2019m on my final segment diversified and that\u2019s on Slide 7.

As always any impact of acquisitions isn\u2019t affected into the guidance, but otherwise let me stop here and Jessie, I will turn it over to you. Let\u2019s open it for questions. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen at this time will be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Hi, guys, good morning. Andrew K. Silvernail: Good morning, Allison. Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC:  You\u2019ve talked about a lot the organic investment you know clearly gaining attraction and its sounds like even when you talk about what are you are growing well ahead of the end markets there. Is there any maybe to how to do this to sort of say your growth is \u2013 based on your ownerships you are growing X time as your end market, just globally, is there a way to talk about that yet? Andrew K. Silvernail:  Yes, I think so, I think if were to dissect it, I\u2019m going to say that our end markets are probably in the 2% to 3% growth rate and so we believe at a goal of being 200 to 300 basis points above end market growth and I think we are there to slightly a little bit better than that this years, but some of it is really project driven and so I want to mindful of that and as we look at 2015, if you look at some of the big things that we are going to comp against, I wouldn\u2019t bake that in. right, I wouldn\u2019t bake in we are going to 300 or 400 basis points above. I think that\u2019s harder to do and we will face those comps next year. Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC:  But I guess that you\u2019re getting attraction on this organic investment and your fees are called out to progressing at this point. Andrew K. Silvernail:  I really am, I think the new products that we have been investing in, we\u2019re not getting attraction yet from that. Those cycles are longer, I mean when I say, I\u2019m thinking back kind of 18-mnths when we started really moving a bunch of cash over that\u2019s a little bit slower aside from X-Smart. X-Smart is a big one that\u2019s churned quickly and also we've had some investments in our water business that the new products have really grained a lot of traction. It\u2019s a lot about market penetration and really over serving our core customers where we've driven lead times down from core customers, we've improved quality and service levels. I think we\u2019ll start to get more benefit of new products as we get into 2015 and beyond. Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC:  Great and I guess just looking we\u2019re half way through the year, compared to where we were at the end of last year. Any thoughts, surprises, changes that you have noticed and we\u2019re mid-way through? Andrew K. Silvernail:  Not really, I think the \u2013 If I were going to kind of balance it off, I would say the core global economy is a little bit better than we had modeled going into the year, I think that\u2019s true. At the same time, I think what I call just the volatility issues that are happening around the world and I\u2019ll break those into three things, I\u2019ll break it into China, and I think the capital volatility in China is even higher than we expected it to be, in terms of kind of investment quarter-to-quarter and I think that\u2019s going to continue to swing. And what happening, you know we are not politicians here and we are not economists, but we are really mindful of what's happening in the Middle East and in Eastern Europe, more than anything else about what it can do to kind of the economies around the world, not so much that we have huge chunks of business, although we do have some and we had a pretty good sized order for the middle east that got pushed and we don\u2019t know if it will happen this or not just given what's going on in Iraq as am example and while we don\u2019t have a lot of business in Russia, Ukraine, there is some and we did loose some business in Russia that we expected to get \u2013 the inability to ship it at this point and then really, kind of how it could affect the rest of the world. That is how I would even it out. Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Great, thank you. Andrew K. Silvernail: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Nathan H. Jones \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.:  Good morning, Andy, Heath, Mike. Andrew K. Silvernail: How are you sir? Nathan H. Jones \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.:  Well, thank you. A couple of questions. I think I will start on FSD. If we look at that sequentially from the first quarter to the second quarter, you had the huge dispensing order ship in the first quarter. And you're almost flat in the second quarter. Can you talk about \u2013 and I think that was surprisingly strong, from my point of view. Andrew K. Silvernail: Yes. Nathan H. Jones \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Can you talk about where that came from, how unexpected it was from your end, and kind of what a sustainable level of revenue in that business is or in those businesses are? Andrew K. Silvernail: Yes, that was a pretty special quarter there\u2019s no doubt about it. And what I mean by that is the Dispensing business was marginally stronger than we thought it was going to be, but BAND-IT was really strong and the fire business was the trailer business in fire. We had a couple of customers who frankly came in early we thought things are going to ship in the third quarter and they ask from in the second. And that\u2019s trailer business has been big for us. And we think it\u2019s going to continue to be a good business, but it\u2019s kind of going into a little bit the boom cycle here, where you\u2019ve seen a lot of the nuclear facilities around the world putting in these redundant systems. And this is that \u2013 this is really from for what happened in Fukushima back \u2013 was 2.5 years ago now, 3 years ago and that\u2019s what happen. So I would say that it\u2019s really materially better performance at fire, incrementally better performance at dispensing and strong core performance at advantage. So it was stronger than we thought it was going to be, no doubt. Nathan H. Jones \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Is the strength at BAND-IT from them continuing to find new applications, or what is driving the incremental strength at BAND-IT right now? Andrew K. Silvernail: It is that, but I\u2019d also say there are two things that are helping a lot. Number one is transportation side; we got a number of platforms a couple of years ago. And as you know as you look at the transportation business, it\u2019s a lot like frankly our Scientific Fluidics business, where platforms are develop years ahead they launch and then they ramp and what we are seeing now as you\u2019re seeing some of that launch in ramp in that number of those pieces of business that we won two years, three years ago frankly. And so that\u2019s been strong, but also the energy business specifically the downhole business and cable management those have all been strong for us. Nathan H. Jones \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And one more, just back on FMT : you called out energy and chemical markets having experienced demand volatility due to large project delays. Can you talk about where you think we are in that cycle? Because you're not the only ones obviously talking about large project delays and when you think, you might start to see those releases. Andrew K. Silvernail:  Yes. Let me break those into two very different things, because I think the issues are 100% -- 108 degrees from which other chemical is really about, coming of the strength of a number of very large projects specifically in the Middle East that are now in what I\u2019ll call ramp mode. Right, so those programs are coming up and they\u2019re coming into production and so you\u2019re seeing the projects there coming off and that\u2019s really specific to our rector business. So if you look at year-over-year if you break our chemical business and it\u2019s mostly Viking and rector just from our brand perspective. Viking business is actually solid; the rector business is more reliant on chemical projects specifically in the Middle East and a little bit China. I would say that being said if you look at kind of what\u2019s coming through the pipeline and no \u2013 attended, and you look at the Gulf Coast that\u2019s going to start to ramping up big time in next year in 2015. I think that you will bottom out on the project level in the Middle East and you\u2019ll start to see some slow ramp backup, coming in. So I think you\u2019re going to see a really solid 2015 and an improving 2016 really driven by the U.S. investment in chemical. So let me stop there, did I answer your question on chemical? Nathan H. Jones \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. Andrew K. Silvernail: Okay. On the energy side this is more \u2013 we had a number of pretty large projects that were ready for shipment in the Middle East that have got pushed. And now when you say as a push is it going to fall into the second half of the year and should we take up a second half? Honestly don\u2019t know, because these are chunks of business that we have, but it\u2019s a matter of the customer\u2019s ability to take them, and giving what\u2019s going on there, I think that\u2019s the bigger issue. If you actually look at the base chemical business or the base energy business, really solid so the booking term business not concerned at all. Nathan H. Jones \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks very much. Andrew K. Silvernail: Yes. Operator : Thank you. The next is coming from the line of Matt McConnell with City Research. Please proceed with your question. Matthew W. McConnell \u2013 Citi Investment Research.:  Thank you, good morning guys. Andrew K. Silvernail: Good morning Matt. Matthew W. McConnell \u2013 Citi Investment Research.: There certainly see to be more happening on the M&A side, so I wonder could you give us a sense of whether that\u2019s a function of improvement or changes in the environment first maybe your development of IDEX\u2019s M&A function and really just maybe give us a sense of where you\u2019ve added resources over the past year or so? Andrew K. Silvernail: Sure. Sure, so I think \u2013 let met talk about the environment just generally, so if you just look at the number of books that come into our office, you see that radically swing from season-to-season, year-to-year and its as heavy as I\u2019ve seen it in the last five or six years. So you are seeing a lot of people bringing stuff to market. And frankly, you're seeing a lot of marginal business being brought to market which really kind of talk to the strength of a seller\u2019s market out there and so that is up very substantially and it\u2019s pretty hard for us to win an auction, lets just be honest right and its because we tend to be much more discipline in our overall price where we will go on price and we tend to be pretty detailed when it come to diligences right and so we\u2019re not willing to open up to a lot of risk and so we tend to win auction that are right in our sweet spot that\u2019s because we really bring synergy to it and we can create a lot of values. So that part of the business is way up. Starting about 18-months ago maybe a little bit longer than that we started to putting more resources into our platforms so more M&A business development resources into the platform and we also amped up the expectation around our general managers and their reasonability in M&A. And that has improved our pipeline. So if you look at what\u2019s in our pipeline right now that we\u2019re really excited about, its stuff that\u2019s coming out of there, There are few auctions that we are looking at today that we like and do fit the definition I walked through before, but the things that we are still going to get at sub ten time EBITDA generally are going to be things that will have been working on year and are starting to get amped up because of the resources we put in place. Matthew W. McConnell \u2013 Citi Investment Research.:  Great thanks that\u2019s very helpful. Andrew K. Silvernail:  You bet. Matthew W. McConnell \u2013 Citi Investment Research.: And then just quickly, on the higher CapEx outlook : I think the trend we usually see is projects slipping out to the right, but I think you have increased your forecast a little bit. Andrew K. Silvernail: Yes. Matthew W. McConnell \u2013 Citi Investment Research.: What is being prioritized there? Andrew K. Silvernail: It\u2019s what we call smart capital and it\u2019s principally for new products and for productivity. And when I say it productivity I don\u2019t mean just cost productivity, but also bringing lead times down. I visited probably30 plus sites this years as we've traveled around looking at businesses and we are really encouraging people as they are more deeply segmenting their product lines, we are really encouraging people to make smart capital investments in machining, as an example, where we know we are going to get quality benefits, we know we are going to get in lead time benefit. So that the laser cutter I mentioned for dispensing is a great example of that. Could we have managed the business without doing that? Yes, we could have done it, but it dropped lead time significantly, it took cost down and it improves quality and so we are seeing more and more of that and see I have talked a lot about that the strategic vision of this company and one of the things that I have said is we want to be the best specialty manufacturer of highly-engineering products in the world and to do that means you got to have a core capability around specialty manufacturing and that means being willing to make investments around driving that moat around the niche and so we are doing more and more of that. Matthew W. McConnell \u2013 Citi Investment Research.:  Great, sounds good. Thanks very much. Andrew K. Silvernail:  Thanks, Matt. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question is come from the line of Matt Summerville, KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Matthew J. Summerville \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.:  Good morning, just a couple of questions. First, on the internal investments you've been making over the last year or two, Andy, have you guys looked at what your vitality index would have looked like prior to making that incremental investment, and what it looks like now? Andrew K. Silvernail:  I am going to make myself unpopular with a lot of people in the world saying this. I really hate vitality indexes and the reason I do is that they are almost immeasurable and you can manipulate that measurement, I\u2019ve seen it in so many companies and so it tends to be a self-aggrandizing measurement that never goes down. And so we don\u2019t really look at that. what I look at is the new product pipeline business-by-business and that means when you go and you sit in, you know you go to Aegis and you go sit in Baton Rouge and you look at what\u2019s on their pipeline, what\u2019s coming out, you get a real strong sense of that and our operators get a strong sense of that. And then so that\u2019s kind of one thing we look at and then from a real quantifiable objective, you\u2019re going to see it in your organic growth rates, in our line of work you can\u2019t beat the underlying markets by 200 or 300 basis points, unless you are getting 100 basis points or more from new products. Matthew J. Summerville \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.:  And then just the magnitude of \u2013 I'm curious; as you guys forecast your Q2 with respect to FMT and HST, I guess how much revenue in your mind did not show up in the second quarter, either because of inventory drawdown in the case of instrumentation or because of these Mideast-related project delays? Andrew K. Silvernail: I don\u2019t know Heath, what do you think somewhere between five and 10? Heath A. Mitts: Between $5 million and $10 million I mean there are some specific things that we can point to that are ready to go that we either did not receive cash in advance or whatever the approval was to ship, but its somewhere in the $5 million to $7 million, maybe up to $10 million, it depends on how you want to qualify a couple of the shipments, but that was a meaningful number, I would say that specifically within FMT it would have moved us into the low single-digits of organic revenue growth. Matthew J. Summerville \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: And then just lastly, Andy, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you guys have done quite a bit of digging around in terms of market share in HST, and what is going on with your content, and things like that. I guess I'm curious as to what you can point to that gives you the confidence that there is not a market share issue that it is in fact inventory draw down or end of life programs. Andrew K. Silvernail:  Yes. So you are really talking about Scientific Fluidics within HST and the nice part about where we sit in the supply chain as we have a lot of visibility to what's in development and we have a lot of visibility to what shipping. So, as an example, if you \u2013 we know how many units of instruments in almost any of the major lines of business have been shift in the quarter. And we know how much content we sold of that in the last few quarters. And so if you think of it is kind of two or three quarter cycle, we can estimate that pretty closely. And we look at the relationship between those two things, and if you saw the instrument number is going up and our number is not moving to the same degree, we know we are losing share right, when we can literally track it instrument-by-instrument. So that\u2019s kind of one way of doing it. The second way is as we know what programs have been in development and are end development, and we know if we win them or lose them. And so from that perspective I feel real good about that. I do think \u2013 and we actually don\u2019t behind, I know end market demand certainly did slow a little bit in the second quarter. And I think that the folks who are out there, we talked about this publically have said so also. And if I look again it our rates versus that and how much content we have you can see. And also the fact that we have electronic compounds and a lot of our customers, you can see kind of what\u2019s going on. Matthew J. Summerville \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.:  Great, thanks for that color. Andrew K. Silvernail: You bet. Operator : Thank you. The next question is comes from the line of Scott Graham with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. R. Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies LLC :  Hey, good morning. Andrew K. Silvernail: Hi, Scott. R. Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies LLC : The M&A commentary that you had at the top of the call \u2013 you indicated, Andy, you are close to the finish line, I don't know your exact words, but on five or six situations. Is this sort of the Aegis type of size? What segments are you maybe focused on most within that sort of funnel? Andrew K. Silvernail: Yes. What I would say, Scott, is that they are in the latter stages of development meeting you\u2019ve got either you\u2019re about to get the letter of intent, or you are in that range that\u2019s kind of the stage for us plus or minus. And I would say all of the ones that we are looking at today are bigger than Aegis, but they are not these are not $0.5 billion of things right. So, this one of the things we kind of look at each other and we had a staff meeting last week and were walking through our acquisition funnel and we looking each other, well why these are all things we can land, just it is the nature of kind of what\u2019s going on out there. But that\u2019s kind of the range and I think we\u2019ve got a shot and closing some of this year. At the same time I\u2019m not like, if not a little bit close this year wouldn\u2019t shopping. Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies & Company: Fair enough. The second question is about your guidance, which I know you raised in excess of what you beat at least Street expectations by. I'm just wondering, though, if we look at the guidance, and we look at the second half of the year EPS, it looks like even at the high-end of your range, EPS in the third and fourth quarter looked like sub-10% EPS growth, and that would be something we haven't seen from you guys in a while. Are you holding something back there, Andy? Is there something that you are seeing out there that is bothering you? Is it a comp issue? All of the above? None of the above? Whatever you can help maybe that would be my second question. Andrew K. Silvernail:  Yes. I get your light, its just about 10% earnings growth for the back half of the year; we had a number of very strong discrete items in the first half of this year. And so if you just kind of look at second half versus first half we had a number of very strong discrete items. So I would say, the dispensing business is a big piece of it, the trailer business and fire was very strong. And you are just not going to see those two things happen and also as we look at the first part of 2015 that\u2019s a reality that were going to comp against in the first part of 2015, because of some of those bigger things and we may fill those holes, and we may not by the nature of the businesses, but that\u2019s really the biggest thing as I look at for the first half, second half. I don\u2019t know Heath, your thoughts. Heath A. Mitts:  Yes, thanks Andy. The other piece Scott is that the high end of our range in obviously the implied Q4 numbers as you come into were somewhere between 10% and maybe it creeps up to 11%. The fourth quarter specifically as you recall we had an anomaly in our tax rate last year where in we were down at 25% due to some very specific discrete items that was booked and favorable to IDEX in the fourth quarter of 2013 that we do not predict will recur this year. So that in and of itself is part of the Q4 problem. R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC : Yes, definitely. Your second-half last year tax rates were definitely lower, as well. Okay, that is great. Thanks a lot. Andrew K. Silvernail:  Thanks Scott. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from line of Charley Brady with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Charley D. Brady \u2013 BMO Capital Markets :  All right. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Andrew K. Silvernail: Good morning, Charley. Charles Brady \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : If we could just look at the corporate expense line for a second, I think last quarter on the call you talked about it kind of bumped up in that first quarter, and the thinking was run that out, maybe slight discount from Q1 for the rest of the year. It's obviously well below $18 million this quarter. Was there something in this quarter that maybe got pushed out, and so it ought to take a bump up, and we make it up in Q3 or Q4? Heath A. Mitts: Charlie this is Heath. There is while things that run through that acquisition related expenses and the timing of those things and as we talked about it on the call in the first quarter, we did accelerate some investments for some internal systems investments, some of that came in well below budget, some of that is a little bit of timing issue, but I would project that if you are modeling that you would model a little bit higher than what we ran in the second quarter we ran over \u2013 a little over 15 million I would predicted it somewhere in the 16.5 range for the third quarter and fourth quarter. Charley D. Brady \u2013 BMO Capital Markets :  Okay, that is helpful. Thanks. And Andy, I don't know if I missed it, but I don't think I heard you mention anything about Latin America. And I know it's not a huge piece to you guys, but anything going on down there for you? Andrew K. Silvernail:  It\u2019s not a big piece of business for us. I would say that the biggest stop that we do in Latin America tends to be at our energy business and then rescue and then dispensing. Those are three places that we tend to have the most exposure. It\u2019s a tough place to do business and for most of the businesses that we are in, the two largest economies Mexico and Brazil have pretty unique issues themselves. Brazil is just a tough place to do business unless you are very, very local and we\u2019ve been working that problem for a long time but it\u2019s kind of got what I will call the first world cost structure and the Third World problems and so it\u2019s tough nut to crack and comes with more risk than we like it sometime we still work it. Mexico is a good piece of business for us to generally, but the service principally added the U.S. Charley D. Brady \u2013 BMO Capital Markets :  Right. Okay, thanks. And just one more on Aegis. Is your ongoing expense related to the deal, related to the acquisition \u2013 that is a headwind to margins going forward in the back half of this year? And maybe you can just talk about Aegis in terms of some of their revenue in geographic end market. Is it all U.S.? And as you look at that business \u2013 and I know it's a pretty small business kind of tucking in \u2013 but as you look at that, and you look at what you guys can invest in that; you talked about building something down in Texas, what kind of acceleration in growth of that business do you think you can get out of it over the next couple of years relative to where they have been prior to your ownership? Heath A. Mitts: Why don't you tackle the cost side, and I will tackle the selling side? Charley D. Brady \u2013 BMO Capital Markets :  Okay. Andrew K. Silvernail:  Yes Charlie we incurred about $0.5 million or so in the second quarter related to the purchase price accounting activity with Aegis and we got it another roughly $800,000 in this third quarter that\u2019s baked into our FMT thinking in our overall guidance specifically related to the asset step ups and write-downs. Heath A. Mitts: And on the growth side we think Aegis can grow very fast so the team there has done a wonderful job of building that business they got terrific niche products it\u2019s a wonderful platform to bring our Richter product line into the U.S they are highly complementary product lines going into the similar industries where we don\u2019t have as much market penetration as Aegis had. So I think it does help us and you can accelerate growth there, but still even if you\u2019re growing to 20% you are only talking about $3 million or $4 million top line growth. Now that being said, I think that business can grow at those kinds of rates that\u2019s our expectation of that business. And we\u2019ve asked them to certainly accelerate some of the investments they are making, they are very high-touch business and if you are going to see where they are located in Baton Rouge I mean you can throw a rock and hit their customers and that\u2019s a big piece of what their business is about and they service the Houston region, but they are servicing it from Baton Rouge and so getting right in Houston being right next to that next piece of the customer base will help them accelerate growth. Charley D. Brady \u2013 BMO Capital Markets :  All right great thanks guys. Andrew K. Silvernail:  Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is come from the line of Paul Knight with Janney Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Paul R. Knight \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott LLC :  Andy, you had mentioned that you want to invest in China. Why is that? I love your color there and comment on Brazil. Andrew K. Silvernail:  Yes. I think when I look at the Chinese market its almost comical to think of how that commentary has changed in a couple of years and my view is one of a decade or more and the question is that should you be in those markets over the next 10-years? Are they going to have faster than global growth rates in the next 10-years or not? And I believe they are. The reality is though is that costs have gone up very substantially, you do have what I call is the overall political risk, but if I think about this, if you are willing to live with the volatility and you\u2019re willing to be local that\u2019s a place where business is going grow for us. We don\u2019t have the same kind of risks that a lot of I\u2019ll call it the OEM businesses have where the Chinese government is fundamentally investing in taking market share right, because we\u2019re not at the kind of purchased points, we\u2019re very high mix, very low volume, these are very difficult things to manage, they would rather build locomotives than they would build pumps to go on locomotives right. And so I feel comfortable that that will still be a business that\u2019s good for us, albeit at materially different growth rate than we had two or three years ago, we\u2019re growing 20%, 25% a year, I think its going to be a business that grows high singles to low double-digits for us. Paul R. Knight \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : The analytical instrument peers have indicated that bookings have approached as much as mid/upper teens in the second quarter, even though revenue was very weak to down. When would an analytical instrument cycle on orders for them translate into revenue for you? Andrew K. Silvernail: You can see a 2-ish quarter GAAP depending upon how much inventory is in a channel. So, if inventories are correct I mean and I\u2019m going to say inventory from them to us, right to the inventory between us that\u2019s sitting in their shops. Just using a couple of quarter cycle that the only difference in that is a new product launch right, new product launch you\u2019re going to see that\u2019s ramp actually up ahead of them? Paul R. Knight \u2013 Janney Capital Markets :  Thank you very much. Andrew K. Silvernail: You bet. Operator : Thank you. The next question is comes from the line of Mark Douglas with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question. D. Mark Douglas \u2013 Longbow Research LLC :  Hi, good morning gentlemen. Andrew K. Silvernail: Hi, Mark. D. Mark Douglas \u2013 Longbow Research LLC :  Andy, can you talk to ag? How relevant is it to FMT? And what kind of headwind are you looking at? I mean if you look at some of the OEM equipment guys, they are talking about \u2013 there's potential for a double-digit decline, certainly by the end of the year. Are you seeing the same type of headwinds? Andrew K. Silvernail: So, let me cut into two piece. So, Banjo is about 4% or 5% of IDEX plus or minus, so you can kind of back end from there. It\u2019s a great business for us, we grew in the second quarter our expectations are that actual business is going to be modestly up in the second half, very modestly up. And really because of what\u2019s you are seeing on the industrial side. So, again about 30% of that business is industrial and about 40% of the total business is aftermarket. So, let me kind of break this into the pieces kind of why it\u2019s relevant. If you actually look at the Ag side, I\u2019m going to call Ag OEM piece of the business that is clearly already suffering there is no doubt about that and we expect that to be negative in the second half of the year and we expect probably to be negative in the early part of 2015. So that the industrial side was really strong, very strong double digit growth and plus 20% east it\u2019s just somewhere in that range. So that\u2019s really what made up for. So, we are experiencing what the industry is experiencing on the Ag capital equipment piece of it, there is no doubt about it. Albeit somewhat offset by new products. So, Banjo there is good as we get \u2013 in this company new product development. So you\u2019re seeing that help that a little bit. And then also typically in this industry when you see the OEM side go down we are actually see the aftermarket side expand, because people although then buying new sprayers they have to that they still have got to replace that and so all those things get on the market you tend to have a little bit higher replacement cycle. D. Mark Douglas \u2013 Longbow Research LLC : Okay, that's very helpful. It is not the one-trick ag pony? Andrew K. Silvernail:  No, it\u2019s definitely not and really, we went through our quarterly reviews here, last week, week before and as we\u2019re talking to them, we\u2019re having a very honest discussion about 2015, and their goal is to offset any declines and still get growth in 2015. And I love the enthusiasm and it\u2019s not just a hope and a prayer, you see the new product development cycle, you see the new channel development and so they are working it and I also love the fact that they are not putting their head in the stand, they have seen it all year, we started talking with them in the first quarter about where this was going and be prepared for it. D. Mark Douglas \u2013 Longbow Research LLC :  Great. When you talked about transportation and BAND-IT, is that auto, truck, heavy truck, a combination of both? Andrew K. Silvernail: It\u2019s a combination. The stronger piece of the growth that we were seeing right now is really coming through some of the Tier-1 OEMs, because the business that we won several years ago right, and by the way we\u2019re doing \u2013 we are only on really only one piece of one major OEM and so we\u2019re trying to get on more platforms via those OEMs and we\u2019re trying to get on other platforms. And as you might imagine these are for highly critical applications within auto and truck that you\u2019re solving a very difficult fastening problem. D. Mark Douglas \u2013 Longbow Research LLC : Okay, that is helpful. And then, finally, on this second-half growth expectations, I think you said last quarter you were thinking maybe 4% in the back half. It's probably closer to 5% now, Is that fair? Andrew K. Silvernail: Yes. is that right Heath. Heath A. Mitts: Yes, I\u2019m the guidance for the year is 5% to 67% for the full-year and we are at 6% at the midpoint, so the math would tell you that where we need to be. D. Mark Douglas \u2013 Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Thank you. Andrew K. Silvernail:  Thank you Mark. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Jim Giannakouros with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. Jim Giannakouros \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.:  Good morning guys. Andrew K. Silvernail: Good morning Jim. Jim Giannakouros \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.:  I had thought that you previously said the water muni market was thawing a bit, but today's comments were more about your teams just picking their spots more successfully, driving your results. Can you remind us or just give us your updated thoughts on what exactly you are seeing there? Is it the better budget backdrop that might be improving there for the second half and into 2015? Or you're just not seeing it yet, and it's more maintenance and smaller project type of spend? Heath A. Mitts:  It\u2019s definitely, so what you\u2019re seeing is you\u2019re seeing some \u2013 a little bit pent-up demand on the maintenance side and on what I call the have to that you are still kind of required federally or locally to execute on, we\u2019re seeing some money release there and we\u2019ve been seeing it for a quite long-time now the number of RFQs increasing. So there has been positive sign there for a while, what I would say is really specifically to break our water business down. If you can look at two pieces that we are seeing really nice performance on. One which is the ADS side of it for them that the wins have come down to the strategic choice to focus on a very specific segment of the market but we think, we\u2019re highly differentiated and they have aggressively moved sales, marketing and product development resources around on this very specific segment. And I won\u2019t talk about it just because competitive nature of it, any further than that and we are seeing really nice wins out of there. And then if you look at \u2013 actually look at our iPEK brand which is based out of Austria it\u2019s a new product development story. And so they have had \u2013 they took a serious of products that were getting I call them aged and expensive and they have brought it down to a single platform that has a better cost position and much better margin profile and vastly superior competitive profile and they have won a lot of nice business this year with that iPEK brand and so that\u2019s been one of the best stories with an IDEX. Jim Giannakouros \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.:  Got it. That's helpful. And I'm sorry if I missed it, but on the organic order growth that you saw in FSD. And you cited that rescue was particularly strong. Can you rank order, I guess, the drivers of that 17% number between the other sources of strength that you cited also, dispensing and BAND-IT? Andrew K. Silvernail:  Yes, rescue is definitely number one. That\u2019s a pretty lumpy business. So if you think about that business you end up with a lot of book-and-term business out of small municipalities around the world right that\u2019s kind of base business. And then you tend to get large orders from countries actually, so you will see as an example early last year you saw some really big chunks of business and year before coming out of China where they won large RFQs. This quarter it was a very large order out of the Middle East and so that was the big piece of the overall win. The second thing it really comes down to BAND-IT very, very strong order growth, there you wouldn\u2019t put it one thing except for the auto piece that I talked about, but they were stronger really across their business and so by the way that\u2019s a good sign BAND-IT is one of our \u2013 one of the bellwethers that we look at for overall main it was stronger in the U.S but it is global too, but kind of what\u2019s happening in the underlying economy that\u2019s a good sign there. And then I would say that dispensing was also pretty solid from an order perspective. From a sales perspective -- actually, from the sales perspective it was fire. So fire these are orders that we got a quarter or two quarters ago for the trailers and that was really the strongest piece of that and then dispensing still had pretty strong sales growth right so weren\u2019t going to comping against a big piece of business, but a pretty nice business on there. Jim. Operator? Operator :  Thank you. We\u2019ll move on to the next question which is coming from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. Joseph Giordano \u2013 Cowen and Company, LLC: Hi, guys thanks for taking the call. Andrew K. Silvernail: Hey Joe. Joseph Giordano \u2013 Cowen and Company, LLC: Just a couple of questions. First, on the diversified segment, we touched on it before. Last quarter you called out the big dispensing order, and this quarter your strength in rescue, and things like that. Is this kind of like \u2013 should we stop being surprised by whether it is strength in dispensing, or whether it is something else? Is this like a run rate that we should start thinking about for this segment? Heath A. Mitts:  It\u2019s a little high and these are again these are pretty discrete things right you can put your finger on something discrete and in the last two or three quarters like you know in the last four quarters we've had a number of these things, but also it can go the other way on you and so you know I think its been abnormally strong, but this is the one part of our business that\u2019s more lumpy and that\u2019s just vitality and we don\u2019t have a lot of lumpiness and we've had a lot of things go our way here for the last year. Joseph Giordano \u2013 Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. And maybe on Aegis, I know you get a little more visibility now into those Gulf chemical projects as a result. I\u2019m Just curious -- I'm guessing most of the offerings there are more somewhat on the shorter cycle, but what are you seeing in terms of some of the longer-cycle products going into those facilities, even if it's not stuff that you are specifically on, but as a leading indicator to how it would be for how the projects are moving in general, and as it was leading for you guys? Heath A. Mitts: So from there where we would look is we kind of look in three places, we would look at Viking business, we look at the new programs that are coming through Aegis and therefore kind of what we\u2019re seen at rector too, so we\u2019ve got a pretty good view on where demand is going to go and its going to be strong right I think you\u2019re going to see a pretty strong cycle here for the foreseeable future probably kicking in mostly and as we get into the next year. Joseph Giordano \u2013 Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. I appreciate it guys. Thanks a lot. Heath A. Mitts: You bet Joe. Operator :  Thank you. Our final question for today is come from the line of Walter Liptak with Global Hunter Securities. Please proceed with your question. Walter S. Liptak - Global Hunter Securities, LLC:  Hi, thanks good morning guys. I made the cut. There is a question that you kind of got close to answering that I wanted to ask about : just the revenue growth. You mentioned the organic is 6% year-to-date; your orders were up 7%; and then the organic guide is 5% to 6%. Can you just address that? Heath A. Mitts: Well, we are break into couple of pieces. Once orders were up \u2013 were sales were up 6% year-to-date. Right orders were up 7% in the quarter. So, you are kind of break that and make sure we put those in the right buckets. And we think that the back half of the year kind of looks pretty similar into the first half in terms of overall sales growth in that 5% to 6%. Walter S. Liptak \u2013 Global Hunter Securities, LLC: Okay. It implies a little bit of deceleration. I guess is that on a tough comp, or is it because of FMT? Andrew K. Silvernail: Well, as part of it Walter of course one of that in Q1, we get the large dispensing order that had a significant impact on the Q1 numbers that obviously the big quarters is not recur in the second half. Heath A. Mitts: Yeah we did what 9% organic sales growth \u2013 8% of the sales growth in the first quarter or in the second. It\u2019s just the fixed and we think that kind of levels to step out here in the back half. Jim Giannakouros \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay, got it. And on the FMT part of the business, I'm wondering a little bit about how you get \u2013 how does it get communicated to IDEX when projects push to the right? Is it through distributors? Or is it through E&Cs and these chemical and energy projects that have just pushed a little bit? Andrew K. Silvernail: You kind of gets broken it into a couple of buckets. One is somebody is delaying the actual receipt and that\u2019s going to be expensive to builder it\u2019s right. So, if E&C is doing it terrific, if it\u2019s being done buy, if it\u2019s a more book in term piece of business for large big piece it may come directly from the distributor or customer. Other side is people who we have some a meaningful amount of cash, cash in advance and if we don\u2019t get it, we don\u2019t ship it and that\u2019s the nature of it. So, we saw a little bit of both in the second quarter. Jim Giannakouros \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. I guess the question is : what is your visibility on the pickup or the turn as these projects start getting released? I'm hearing you say 2015? Andrew K. Silvernail: It\u2019s pretty good, we know what\u2019s being build generally we know what the build schedules are and we generally know where we fall into that build schedule and so you can sometimes you can't even pick the month. Generally you can pick the quarter, when you think it\u2019s going to happen. And when they\u2019re delays you tend to see that pretty quickly. We are far enough down in the chain that we are not the first \u2013 we are not the first person notified. but we are also not the first person going in. So, we tend to get visibility relatively early, when we\u2019re \u201csurprise\u201d it\u2019s were something was scheduled to shift late in the quarter and you find out week two, week three that something is an example isn\u2019t going to pay, that not going to pay in this quarter. And so that\u2019s where we kind to get \u201csurprised\u201d. And that doesn\u2019t happen very often, but in those businesses where you do have some relatively large programs and we\u2019re talking about programs that are $1 million to $5 million, we\u2019re not talking about programs that are $10 million or $20 million, so take it for the size of its work. Pretty unusual but it does happened. Walter S. Liptak \u2013 Global Hunter Securities, LLC:  Okay, got it. Okay thanks for the color. Andrew K. Silvernail:  Thanks Walter.

With that I\u2019ll turn our call over to our Chairman and CEO, Andy Silvernail. Andrew Silvernail : Thanks Mike. Good morning everybody I appreciate you all joining us here for our third quarter call. Before I get into the color on the quarter I have a little shout-out here for the Kansas City Royals going to the World Series for the first time since 1985. I have to say that because seating beside me our Chief Financial Officer, Heath Mitts is a born-and-bred KC boy and a long-time season ticket-holder. So good luck to them tonight.  Look, throughout the year, and really for a long time now we\u2019ve been talking about controlling our own destiny and we did that in the third quarter and we\u2019ll do so going forward. In quarter we had 7% organic sales growth, we had sales and operating margins increased in all segments and we delivered 13% EPS growth.  For the year we\u2019re going to up 5% to 6% sales, we\u2019re going to have EPS of between $3.52 and $3.55 and that\u2019s going to up 14% to 15% for the full year. I\u2019ll get into more detail in the numbers here in just a moment. But before that I want to take just a little bit of time and talk about what we\u2019re seeing around the world in terms of geographies and also in the different markets. I also want to take a moment and talk about that the improvement in our cost structure and investments for growth that I outlined in the press release and then just take a minute and talk about the acquisition environment. So first let me get to end markets and geographies. We did see some order softness in August and September, the good news is that we had a nice rebound here so far in October and we\u2019re up to a good start in the fourth quarter. If you look around the world in North America demand has just remained very, very solid you can pick almost any of our businesses and we had strength in the U.S. all of this year and it\u2019s really been the beacon for the company for quite some time now. In Europe, we did have softness in the quarter and I think the idea of contraction in Mainland Europe is very possible, with one really kind of bright spot and that\u2019s the UK where we\u2019re continuing to see a nice performance. At China the term that we use here is uninspiring, it\u2019s been a volatile, kind of choppy environment here for some time. It\u2019s a market we\u2019re going to continue to invest in and grow in, but the overall -- the underlying growth rates have been softer than we have expected really throughout the year. And then finally in the Middle East, we did see some slowdown here in the quarter and that\u2019s really the conflict from the region but we\u2019ve had a decent amount of business that has been awarded but hasn\u2019t been ordered a shift that we do expect at some point happen but certainly what\u2019s going on that region has pushed some things out for some time. If we turn to the markets that we\u2019re in, energy and chemical really near as what we\u2019re seeing geographically. We\u2019ve had some large project order delays in Europe and the Middle East and that\u2019s really affected our SAMPI business in energy and our Richter business on the chemical food process side. The larger orders to get pushed out push the second and the third and frankly we don\u2019t expect them to land here in the fourth quarter, if we do it will be some upside but we expect that business is going to push out into 2015. The rest of the markets that we\u2019re in, the rest of the regions that we\u2019re in, in terms of energy and chemical have been very solid. On the industrial side again the North America remains very, very solid and we\u2019ve had some pretty good business across the globe in the industrial businesses. Analytical instrumentation in the second quarter I mentioned that we have some order softness that did continue into the third quarter and that\u2019s really primarily tide to equipment sales there have been in North America and Europe. This principally impacts our scientific fluidics business, the good news here is we have a seen a pickup in the fourth quarter and that\u2019s a market that we think is very very strong will continue to be serve over time but we think we\u2019ve had a pause here in the last couple of quarters. On the agricultural side, the original equipment business has slowed down as we expected it would with the OEMs dropping volumes but aftermarket has remained quite good. Finally, I\u2019ll comment on municipal, we have seen availability of funds increase slightly kind of 2% to 3% assuming 1% to 2% in our EPEC business which is a pipeline inspection business launch the great new product here earlier in the year and that has really been a home run for that business. The only other note I\u2019d say on municipal is we\u2019ve seen in Asia a real slowdown in funding and that is impacted our rescue business. I want to take a second here and talk about the Q4 cost out and reinvestment actions that I mentioned in the press release. In the last couple of years we have really tightly aligned and organized IDEX to deliver for our customers and for our shareholders all while really funding more and more organic growth and the success that we\u2019ve had here is allowing us to take some targeted cost out actions in the fourth quarter, they\u2019re going to allow us to continue to reinvest aggressively, continue to expand profitability and also close the gap of some of the difficult comps that we know we have in 2015 from some of these large project that happen this year principally in the first half of the year. We are fortunate that the good work that we\u2019ve done has avail these opportunities and like I said before we\u2019re going to continue to control on our destiny regardless of the environment and this is going to allow us to continue to do that. We\u2019ll get real specific on this in the fourth quarter, when we give out the detail in the call but I\u2019d also add here to note that this is not been included in the guidance that we mentioned in the press release form what we\u2019re talking about today but of course we\u2019ll give you that details in the fourth quarter call. Finally on capital deployment, we\u2019ve increased capital spending this year all around enabling organic growth and driving productivity and year-to-date CapEx is up 46% to $34 million so it\u2019s up $11 million versus last year year-to-date and that\u2019s all about how do we drive profitable growth in our businesses. We also earlier in the year increased in our dividend 22% to $0.28 per share and we\u2019re going to keep in that 30% ratio that we talked about consistently.  Finally, if you look at share repurchases we\u2019ve continue to buy shares we\u2019re going to end up of about 2% annual reduction this year and the quarter we bought 831,000 shares but I\u2019ll note that as a market weakens, we had a well-planned 10b5-1 in place that accelerated repurchases as the market soften so I think we tend to buy few more shares here in the quarter because of that. Lastly, I\u2019ll talk about the M&A market, year-to-date not much has changed since we talked a quarter ago. It\u2019s still a seller\u2019s market. Valuations remain high even though the public markets have corrected, you certainly have not seen that in the near term in the private markets and so again it really slows seller\u2019s market and we\u2019ve got at any one time we\u2019ve got 4 to 6 opportunities that are in the diligence space and when we talked a quarter ago we had two that we had pretty darn close to the finish line and at the last minute I\u2019d say valuations really ran and we decided to opt out of both of those because they really fell out of our parameters for sensible capital deployment. We\u2019re going to remain very disciplined and we\u2019re committed to building through acquisitions as well as organically but it\u2019s got to fit strategically and it\u2019s got to fit financially. Alright, with that let\u2019s move on to results for the quarter among slide 4. As I mentioned 4, organic sales were up 7% in the quarter that total sales were up 9% and we had increases across all segments. Orders were down 5% and in total 6% organically to 507 million but if you take out the dispensing order in the large material process order that we had in this quarter, orders were flat. Operating margins were 20.8% up a 100 basis points year-over-year and the improvements was really driven by outstanding performance in health and science and it diversified. And I just got to give credit to the teams across the board continuing to drive excellent profitable growth in the business. Free cash flow is $92 million it was down from last year but we still delivered a 130% of net income and there were two things that really affected cash from quarter one was CapEx as I mentioned before being up 46% year-to-date and also with the accelerating volumes we bundled to more working capital but overall still a great job on cash flow. And finally as I mentioned before EPS was $0.88 it was up 13% from last year. Alright, I\u2019m going to turn to the segment discussions among slide 5, and we\u2019ll start with the fluid metering. Third quarter, we had a 1% decrease in orders and that decrease was really attributed to what we\u2019re seeing in the Ag OEM side with Banjo and little bit here of the non-U.S. energy stuff that I mentioned before. Organic sales were up 4% in the quarter, Op margin was up 10 basis points to 24.5% but I will mention that we\u2019ve $800,000 in inventory step up with the Aegis in the quarter and we would have been up another 40 basis points happened and also we would have been in the low 30s entering to flow through if you don\u2019t include the inventory step up with Aegis. Sales across FMT were up in all platforms except for Ag and let me just touch on the platforms here for a second. Water has continued to have just a really good year, good story to whole year, municipal spending up slightly but the better story is that we continue to drive growth through new products and targeted share gains and it\u2019s really allowed us to outpace the market and Florian and his team have just done an outstanding job the whole year. Quote activity remains relatively strong and we\u2019re excited as we look at the opportunities going forward. Energy I\u2019ve already talked a bunch about what\u2019s happen in some of the project side, again we continue to have strength in North America. It has been offset by what we\u2019ve seen in Europe and the Middle East and we\u2019re going to have some volatility as I mentioned before and we\u2019re okay with that because we like our position in overall in the energy business. In terms of chemical food process it\u2019s followed some of the trends that I mentioned before, but some of that\u2019s been offset by really outstanding execution and new product development at Viking. Our North American distribution business is up and they\u2019ve had some great new products that hit the market recently that have really surprise to the upside. Finally, I\u2019ve already talked about what\u2019s going on with ag, but remember that when we talk about Banjo only a third of that business is tied to the OEM business and the aftermarket remain solid and the industrial actually remains very, very good. So we got a good backlog going into the fourth quarter and we segmented that business more and more, so as we look at 2015 and we still think we can have a pretty decent year there. All right, let me go on to health and science I\u2019m on page six. In the third quarter orders were down 2% and that was entirely due to that the MPT order that I mentioned from year ago from China organic sales were actually up 5% in the quarter and we expanded margins 150 basis points so really nice job. Scientific Fluidics, I\u2019ve already touched on this a little bit but the trends follow the overall equipment sales trends, there is some hangover from inventory in the channel some big new product launches that were early in the year. But again as I mentioned our share is very much intact and we\u2019ve had nice solid start to the fourth quarter. Optics and photonics has remained stable in the quarter we\u2019ve had outstanding profitability improvement really from productivity and favorable product mix in the platform. Material process technology I\u2019ve talked about this a bunch already. We did have the tough comp here in the quarter. We had great sales growth really from our Asian industrial and pharmaceutical businesses, terrific leverage as we got in the sales out the door and just remember that this is the lumpiest business within health and science. We will kind of see that from time-to-time, but we see real nice order stability and sale stability through the balance of the year. The industrial-facing businesses, the core distribution businesses in North America, Western Europe and China have all been solid and these guys have just done a terrific job of segmenting businesses, having new products in place and having great plans for profitable share growth.  All right, I\u2019m on our final segment on diversified that\u2019s a slide seven. Orders were down 20% really all of it due to the dispensing order from last year. This segment is our lumpiest segment dispensing fire and rescue all rely on projects. I will say however that the underlying organics that they\u2019re doing are really terrific. If you look across those businesses the organic sales growth and order growth that we\u2019ve seen has been excellent and that\u2019s what really turned into great sales growth here in the third quarter so it\u2019s a flip side of the order equation. We had 18% up in the segment. We had really outstanding performance by BAND-IT; strong conversion in our fire and suppression business with the trailers being shift, so really outstanding performance on a top-line and even more impressive on the bottom line we had 420 basis points of margin improvement from leverage and from great productivity across the segment. Really if you look at sales and profit there up year-over-year and every business then diversified BAND-IT has just been a great story all year long, each market and geography is up and they just continue to have outstanding execution and leadership in the markets.  Dispensing has continued to execute and improve productivity. If you take out that one large order that we shift here we\u2019ve had good growth throughout Western Europe and North America and additionally X-SMART, that\u2019s just been a terrific story in Western Europe and emerging markets that\u2019s been a great new product for us here for some time.  On the fire suppression side team has done a very nice job executing on orders to get those fire trailers out the door and we expect that the core business in North America and China is going to continue to be flat the markets are but we think we\u2019ll have the opportunity to continue to take some share and grow those businesses. And finally on rescue I mentioned before that the Asian municipal markets have wait on this a little bit but we continue to have really outstanding results in North America the new product introductions and we continue to be high on the rescue business. Okay. Let\u2019s flip to slide eight and we\u2019ll talk about guidance for the quarter and for the full year. And again just remember that the guidance here it doesn\u2019t include the impact from the cost initiatives that I talked about earlier. In Q4, we expect EPS to be $0.85 to $0.88 operating margin around 20% and a tax rate above 28.5%, this assumes the U.S. Government improves the R&D tax credit by December 31st.  We also think we\u2019re going to have 2% top line headwind from that facts and that\u2019s can translate into about $0.02 a share loss from our earlier expectations that we talked about a quarter ago. For the full year we\u2019re raising the low end of our guidance by $0.02, we now expect EPS to be $3.52 to $3.55 and organic growth to be 5% to 6% for the full year. Full year operating margin is going to exceed 20% and just some final modeling if you guys to think about, full year tax rate is going to be around 29%, CapEx should be 48 million to 52 million and we think free cash flow will be about a 120% of net income. As always we exclude from this any impact from acquisitions or cost charges with any future acquisitions and again this also the impact of fourth quarter cost-out initiatives. So with that, let me stop here and Diego I\u2019ll turn it over to you and we can open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time we\u2019ll conduct our question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Charley Brady with BMO Capital Markets, please state your question. Charley Brady - BMO Capital Markets : Just a couple of questions on the orders. And I jumped on late, so I apologize if you covered this. On FMT, did you give the orders organically ex-acquisitions? Andy Silvernail : Yes, we did, we have that in their hold on a second Charley so let me make sure I actually speak about this correctly. We said that overall FMT orders were down 1% organically and that was really entirely due to the OEM business with the in Ag and we also have some non-U.S. energy stuff that got pushed out. Charley Brady - BMO Capital Markets : Okay. I guess I was -- without the acquisition, it was made in Q2. Andy Silvernail : Yes, organically, when we say organic we\u2019re excluding that. Charley Brady - BMO Capital Markets : Okay. I just wanted to make sure I was clarified on that. And what's the -- on FMT, excluding that large dispensing order last year, what would have orders been up or down? Andy Silvernail : You mean diversified? Charley Brady - BMO Capital Markets : Yes. Andy Silvernail : We have never kind of characterized it like that but you can kind of back into the math of it. So, it was down 20% in the quarter and in all of that was due to that large order that comp. Operator : Our next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel, please state your question. Nathan Jones - Stifel Nicolaus : Just on FST for a minute, I mean I think we are through that diversified order now. None of that shipped in the third quarter, correct? Andy Silvernail : We don\u2019t know what we\u2019ve been past that since the early second quarter. Nathan Jones - Stifel Nicolaus : So obviously a very strong performance for margins in that business now. Assuming we don't have another large diversified or dispensing order or something like that, are we at margins that are sustainable now? Or was there something in the mix or something else that drove them higher than you expected? Heath Mitts : Nathan, this is Heath. Always the segment the diversified segments always going to have some element of mix just relative with the four businesses that are in there. BAND-IT is performing very well and we obviously enjoy very healthy margins out of the BAND-IT platform. So, I wouldn\u2019t tell you the model of 26 let\u2019s say somewhere in that 24 to 24ish range is probably a good modeling but understand that it can swing a couple of hundred basis points in either side of that given mix in the given quarter. Nathan Jones - Stifel Nicolaus : Okay. So we shouldn't expect it to stay up at 26? Andy Silvernail : No. Nathan Jones - Stifel Nicolaus : -- some quarters it might be. Andy Silvernail : -- internally model it but again it\u2019s going to swing on project activity and it\u2019s going to swing on mix within that business. Nathan Jones - Stifel Nicolaus : Okay, that's cool. 24% is more like a baseline number there. Obviously, invested quite a bit of money in CapEx this year relative to what you usually spend. It's still not that high even at these levels. When you are looking forward into 2015, are there still opportunities to deploy CapEx to drive growth in 2015? Have you exhausted those? Will they be less next year? Andy Silvernail : We actually think that it\u2019s going to continue to ramp up. So part of what you\u2019re seeing in the cost out that we\u2019re doing here in the fourth quarter it\u2019s really a combination of cost reduction and pretty aggressive reinvestment and allows if it\u2019s come down to the segmentation we\u2019ve been doing here for a couple of years just really aggressively segmenting our markets and our businesses so that understand more deeply where some of the these profit pools are and a great example of that is Viking. So, in this quarter alone they\u2019ve had a handful of new products that come out of segmentation that we\u2019ve funded really aggressively and they\u2019re winning and actually just yesterday we received a pretty good size of orders at Viking for those new products that launched and so we\u2019re pretty excited about that so we think there is more and as we\u2019re challenging the teams more deeply that to find more organic opportunities we\u2019re finding them to be more aggressive in terms of asking for money and as I said in the past, we\u2019ll fund organic stuff all day along as aggressively as we can. Nathan Jones - Stifel Nicolaus : So should we expect a higher CapEx number next year? Andy Silvernail : Nathan, I think a fair number just to model with is still around 2% of revenue. This year we\u2019re going to be attend more than that in prior years we\u2019ve been just under 2% but I still think 2% plus or minus $5 million is probably a good number so, yes I do think it ramps up to Andy\u2019s point next year but we\u2019re not talking about doubling going forward -- going from 45 to 90 we\u2019re talking about going moderately higher and just and these are not made up just as you know as we talked about and as you can imagine given our decentralize nature these are not made up of any one or two items that are driving this. These are series of opportunities across the entire IDEX portfolio. Nathan Jones - Stifel Nicolaus : Okay. But we should consider -- we should think about 2% of revenue as being your CapEx number for the foreseeable future? Andy Silvernail : Yes, of course plus or minus here. Nathan Jones - Stifel Nicolaus : Okay, cool. You talked about some push outs of projects in Middle East and Europe. What\u2019s your sense for the possibility that those turns from delays into cancellations? Andy Silvernail :  Honestly I\u2019m not sure. In our forecast this year and the next year we have it at zero and so we don\u2019t bet on that kind of stuff so we\u2019ve got it there we know that they\u2019re out there but in particular if you look at what\u2019s going on with the SAMPI stuff, it\u2019s going right into the Middle East and we\u2019ve been awarded the business sitting they\u2019re shooting at each other. So, I don\u2019t expect that\u2019s going to happen anytime soon. The chemical stuff I\u2019m not as concerned about that\u2019s much more what I think is a push out and plus that\u2019s be it made up for in speed what\u2019s going on in the U.S.  The energy stuff I want to put a full zero on, for the foreseeable future into the Middle East and then the chemical stuff I do think is a push and that does happen. Nathan Jones - Stifel Nicolaus : Well, I have always known you to plan for the worst, Andy, so on the inventory step-up charges, are they complete now? Andrew Silvernail :  Yes, it was 800,000 this quarter and 500,000 last quarter that\u2019s done so you should see a take up there improvement for FMT. Operator :  Our next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please state the question. Allison Poliniak - Wells Fargo : Can we just going back to energy again, North America obviously concerns crudes and somewhat collapse, obviously, we are seeing it in the energy there, concerns about investments in the U.S. are you guys seeing that, are people talking about that yet? Andy Silvernail :  No, just remember where we play principally right, we\u2019re playing in the midstream so we\u2019re not playing for the most part, where holes are being putting around. So we\u2019re much more affected by the production equation than we are by the hole in the ground equation. So we haven\u2019t seen that yet, I suspect that I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be a material impact to our business kind of one way or the other, for the most parts just because where we sit today I do think it\u2019s likely to have some impact on acquisition valuations that are out there and that might actually open up some doors just from opportunities. Allison Poliniak - Wells Fargo : Okay, great. And I guess that leads me into my next question. You know, you talked about maybe multiples compressing a little bit on the energy. But multiples have been here -- we've been at this level -- it seems like you've been at this high level for quite a number of quarters here. Andy Silvernail :  Yes. Allison Poliniak - Wells Fargo : I mean, is there -- I mean, what\u2019s your thought I mean, do we need to change criteria here if this is a sustained level or are you just expecting that at some point this will kind of come back to you guys? Andy Silvernail :  The way I look at it is we first start Allison, with saying, does this matter to us strategically? And once we answer that question we\u2019ve historically said 12% to 15% ROIC cash-on-cash ROIC, there are some businesses that we would buy that would be lower than that in terms of hurdle to be candid with you. There are some things that we would buy that would be kind of in the 10ish percent range because they matter to us and we\u2019re rolling distraction and obviously the spread of capital is pretty attractive. So there are few things out there that we would do that for. But for the most part I really think that we got to remain disciplined. We\u2019ve all seen this movie many, many times. And it eventually, it does tip over and even though we saw in the public markets here in the last month or two months that has availed some opportunities in terms of capital deployment that weren\u2019t as good at that period of time. So I think we got to be patient we\u2019ve got a great balance sheet, outstanding cash flow and we\u2019re going to keep disciplined here. Operator :  Our next question comes from Paul Knight with Janney Capital. Please state your question. Paul Knight - Janney Capital : If I look at the bookings growth on the health and science side or the order of the 2% decrease, it seems to go counter to kind of a low-single digit revenue growth of your customers. Can you talk to that spread? Andrew Silvernail :  Yes, couple of things, first and foremost we\u2019re tied to the equipment side not to the consumable piece and that has been the piece that has been outperforming lately has been the consumable piece of businesses. And also we don\u2019t perfectly match in terms of quarter-by-quarter we bought because of how new product shift, how inventory moves in the system but certainly within two or three quarters you\u2019ll see a pretty good correlation. So I\u2019m not particularly concerned about what we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace right now in terms of a gap between us and our major customers. Paul Knight - Janney Capital : Do you think that China is improving or kind of the same? Andrew Silvernail :  It\u2019s kind of the same. I think what\u2019s been talked about in the press now is more accurate to what has been happening here for some time. So I think the new cycle has caught up with reality. I will say that I don\u2019t think it is deteriorating further I think that\u2019s important because if you\u2019d asked me that question this time last year even into the first quarter I think we\u2019d have said that the growth rates had deteriorated significantly. So I think we\u2019re kind of in the relatively steady state but also realizing steady state in China is a lot of volatility. Operator :  Our next question comes from Scott Graham with Jefferies. Please state your question. Scott Graham - Jefferies : So I'm looking at the orders across the businesses, and I know, Andy, you mentioned at the top that you saw August and September softer, and then October better, and which does explain some things. You know one of the things I think we are trying to gauge here is the impact of the headlines on order patterns; you guys are particularly short cycle with your product sales. Do you think that that was a reaction to what some of the negative headlines that have come across over the last couple of months? And then maybe October picked back up again because it needed to, because they had under-ordered? How are you looking at that? Andy Silvernail :  I think Scott, I think that\u2019s partially correct I think number one, I think we should recognize that Europe in particular and the Middle East in particular, they actually that the business is softened because of what\u2019s going on in those regions right in terms of the economic growth and also some of the conflict in the region. So I think that\u2019s very much real I think that got exacerbated some of the new cycle and some people pulling back on those things and probably what we\u2019re seeing a little bit October is a rebound from that. So October for us and the order book has been pretty solid and so it\u2019s encouraging and I don\u2019t think that what we\u2019re seeing in October is necessarily sustainable I think there is some snap back. Scott Graham - Jefferies:  Right. But since you are short cycle, that at least gives you, call it, the first three weeks of the month of the quarter that at least gives you some confidence on your fourth-quarter organic sales guide, yes? Andy Silvernail :  Yes, if you remember right, we go into any quarter and we\u2019ve got about plus or minus we\u2019ve got half of our business booked going into a quarter. So, we\u2019ve got a book in turn the other half and so generally if it\u2019s the first 4 to 6 weeks of our quarter are strong we are in good shape. Scott Graham - Jefferies: Understood. I want to maybe just, with my follow-up question, just go back to a prior question about M&A. Andy Silvernail :  Sure. Scott Graham - Jefferies: And you have a lot of directions to go here. I mean, obviously, I'm sure nothing has changed; FMT and SHT are still the main areas of focus. Here's a question I just maybe want to ask you, I don't know if you can answer it. But if you say that, in the second quarter, you had two situations where you were at the finish line but then needed to walk, but now that you have four to six, are those four to six or any of them or all of them as close to the altar as the two? Or further away? Andy Silvernail :  No, I wouldn\u2019t say they\u2019re necessarily as close the differences is both two that we walked away from were auctions. And so you can live with that volatility, right? You eat the cost of the diligence and then at the end of the day if someone decides to write a big foolish check at their business and so that\u2019s it -- there is not much you can do about that one. So, what we\u2019re seeing right now is we do have some more preparatory stuff right now and I feel good about but also couple of things that we\u2019re looking at are in Europe and as you know the diligence cycle is it\u2019s a little bit longer and if you get anywhere close to the holidays being pushed into next year that\u2019s just reality. So, not quite as close but a little bit better in terms of profile not being auctions. Operator :  Our next question comes from Mark Douglass with Longbow Research, please state your question. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research :  Andy, can you discuss IOP in the quarter and what the outlook is there? Andrew Silvernail :  Yes, so orders were basically flat year-over-year not concerning for us great profitability improvement as you remember we had a really strong order quarter last quarter in IOP so feel good about that. Some of the end markets Mark aren\u2019t quite as robust as I think maybe we thought they would be we kind of thought that some of the semi business would even be stronger than spend. So it\u2019s not quite as strong as we thought maybe going into this I think the fourth quarter I think we\u2019re in pretty decent shape in total and just generally that the overall profit improvement there has been great. I think we\u2019ve said this before in the past but we\u2019re now into the 20s in terms of EBITDA margin in the platform and it\u2019s performing like we hope it would. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research : Okay. So, semis is still --? Andrew Silvernail :  It\u2019s still soft, I don\u2019t know what you thought but we thought it would be stronger here at this time this year and it kind of softened up. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research : I thought it would be stronger for multiple quarters. Andrew Silvernail : Yes, yes. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research : It keeps getting pushed out kind of like the energy stuff. Andrew Silvernail : Yup. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research : Speaking of energy, what is your exposure -- you talk about North America is good, but with the petrochem build out expected in 2015 and beyond in North America --. Andrew Silvernail : Yes. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research : -- how does IDEX benefit, or will you benefit on the petrochem side? Andrew Silvernail : Yes, so we actually capture that in our chemical food process platform more the most part not totally but for the most part and we feel really good about that so we\u2019ve done a handful of things first and foremost with actually if we put a bunch more resources down into that region from our long standing businesses. We also the acquisition of Aegis was important for us. We\u2019re putting a new facility in the Huston area for Aegis. As you know Aegis is out of Baton Rouge and we\u2019re actually putting a new facility in Huston because that\u2019s a high touch business very very high touch business. And Aegis actually allows us to bring our Richter business closer to the U.S. market one of the things that we struggled within the past, it was not really having the right kind of channel into the U.S. for our Richter pumps and valves and we\u2019ve got that now. So and also in our Corken business touches it too. So we feel pretty good about that exposure and we think 2015 is going to be good year. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research :  Would you say it\u2019s still less than 5% of sales, though? Or --? Andy Silvernail :  In total the petrochem fees less than 5% sale fees. Heath Mitts :  Right, it\u2019s more than that yes. Andy Silvernail :  I have to going back and exactly quantify it, because you\u2019ve got to kind of break apart some different businesses. But you could probably say that\u2019s 5 to 10 definitely. Heath Mitts :  Yes, it\u2019s in the range and it touches multiple areas of IDEX that\u2019s the only reason we have to go and look at in all the different spots in IDEX that are impacting by that Mark. Andy Silvernail :  I mean you got Viking itself which is 10% of sales and good chunk of Viking goes there you got a big piece of Richter and all of Aegis right -- Heath Mitts :  Element of Seals -- Andy Silvernail :  Yes, element, so you got pieces of the company that touch in so many ways. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research :  Right. And then finally, on the cost-outs in 4Q, are you planning on excluding those? Is that why you\u2019re not inputting that in -- Andy Silvernail :  No, we\u2019ll take it in our P&L it\u2019s just that we didn\u2019t have it nail down exactly because there are going to be some moving parts here before it\u2019s all finalized. But we\u2019ll actually take it in the P&L. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research :  Okay, but it\u2019s not in guidance at this point? Andy Silvernail :  No, it\u2019s not in guidance at this point, no. Operator :  (Operator Instruction) Our next question comes from Kevin Maczka with BB&T Capital Markets. Kevin Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets : Can we go back to the 20% margin guidance for Q4? It seems like you\u2019ve been guiding that level all year, and to your credit, exceeding it. I know you talked about FSD, and maybe there is some mix shift. We shouldn\u2019t necessarily think that that margin continues at that high level. But is there anything else going on in terms of mix or currency or the segments that you can point to as to why that would come down like that sequentially? Andy Silvernail :  Yes, there are really two things. So one is the very, very strong performance in FSD if you think about that sequentially that\u2019s going to be a big impact. But also to be fair the MPT had really strong quarter with health and science and that was a nice profitability in terms of incremental profitability that on a sequential basis we don\u2019t see in fourth quarter. So that 20% I think is a pretty good number. Kevin Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets : Okay. And then, just in terms of currency, on slide 8, you mentioned the 2% FX headwind. I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s a revenue headwind, can you bring that down to the bottom line and comment on what that means at EPS? And then, as we look forward and think about 2015, assuming rates kind of stay where they are, can you just quantify at all or give some goal posts on what that might mean to 2015? Heath Mitts :  Kevin this is Heath. It really is just the currency translation but that the flow through and in the quarter we\u2019re expecting somewhere around 9 million at current rates we don\u2019t try to predict what the rates will be throughout the rest of the quarter. But at current rates we\u2019re anticipating around $9 million headwind and so it\u2019s just really the statutory flow through that 9 million impacts are earnings by a couple of cents. But it\u2019s really just the translation not so much that we have some type of hedge that\u2019s out of place. Kevin Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets :  How about next year? Heath Mitts :  Next year we haven\u2019t quantified it yet to be honest we\u2019ll need some time to see where the fourth quarter settles in, but when we give our guidance for next year we\u2019ll certainly come out with that. Operator :  Our next question comes from Matt Summerville with KeyBanc. Please state your question. Matt Summerville - KeyBanc : Good morning. With respect to the margins in HST, I went back and looked they are at the best level they\u2019ve been in three years plus I guess, this breakout, is it really related just solely to mix or is there something else sort of driving that and I guess what\u2019s the right way to think about margins in this business going forward? Andy Silvernail :  Yes, so Matt if you exclude the sequential improvement from material process and you look at the underlying other pieces that make that up, those are all still positive. So it\u2019s a good story almost no matter what you\u2019re talking about. And so we feel pretty good you\u2019re seeing improvement and where is that coming from principally, it\u2019s coming from the couple of places. We continue to see better overall profit execution at optics, that\u2019s been a really good story. But also on the industrial side our gas business it\u2019s in there and they have just done a great job over the last, really the last couple of years we are continuing to expand profitability. That\u2019s a business that has just done -- really if you back five years you look at today that\u2019s entirely different business than it was five years ago in terms of overall profit profile and growth rate. So those are the big pieces. Matt Summerville - KeyBanc : And then is there any way you can quantify the magnitude of business that you\u2019ve sort of zeroed out at this point related to the Mideast and energy, is it $2 million, is it $20 million? Can you at least triangulate on that a little bit? Andy Silvernail :  It\u2019s around $10 million. So if you actually looked at what got pushed into the second or third and we\u2019re not going to kind of count it, it\u2019s about a $10 million impact in the quarter. Operator :  Our next question comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen, please state your question. Joe Giordano - Cowen:  Hey, guys, thanks for taking my call. So I guess order of weakness, if we could talk about HST a bit on a sequential basis. You talked about it on a year-on-year versus the one order, but it's down a bit from where we've been over the last three quarters. So could you talk maybe more on a bit of a sequential? Andrew Silvernail : Are you talking about order rates, sales rates? Joe Giordano - Cowen: Yes, order rates in HST. Andrew Silvernail : It nothing that\u2019s particularly meaningful Joe, when you look at that and you\u2019ll have some swings here and there quarter-to-quarter it\u2019s not that big a deal so that is not been in there that you look and you say it is a big yellow flag or red flag. Joe Giordano - Cowen: Okay. Heath Mitts :  Joe, I\u2019d jump in, this is Heath. There is a -- the element of the segment that is depend upon kind of daily book and bill is something along according to expectations which would be fine. It\u2019s the noise and it comes generally from the project activity on a year-over-year basis. Joe Giordano - Cowen: Okay. Okay. And then I guess more of an esoteric question, I guess. But how should we think -- how would you gauge and characterize the level of your conservatism when you are giving your guidance now? Since five quarters in a row, not just meeting the midpoint but meeting the -- beating the top end. And obviously, a credit to you guys, that would be better if more companies did that. But how would you gauge, like, the level of conservatism inherent in your guidance now, as it was maybe late last year or something like that? Andy Silvernail :  Well, first and foremost Heath can\u2019t spell esoteric. So we -- I don\u2019t know, I try to look at that and we try to guide in a way that is he is responsible and we feel that we have real confidence in delivering on that and by the way it\u2019s also how we manage the business so one of the things that I said time to time again is we\u2019re a company that can respond very very fast with an uptick in business because our direct labors is single digits and so we can move quickly on the upside on the downside as you think about how high our contribution margins are, that\u2019s a painful equation so, as you look at what we\u2019re going to do here in the fourth quarter and we\u2019ve done a lot of hard work here to prepare our organization to be able to do that to get in better and better fighting shape. But another piece of that is that it continues to lower that breakeven point to the company and so that\u2019s how we manage the business and so we\u2019re not trying to be overly conservative at the same time, the bottom line is we\u2019re just trying to be responsible. Joe Giordano - Cowen: Okay. And just last from me. Have you talked about at all where -- like which businesses the cost-out might be? And then last, what are you seeing in European Union right now? You've mentioned Asia; you mentioned North America. Andy Silvernail :  So, this is not some big companywide thing that we\u2019re doing, we haven\u2019t might picked some random number is really been excellent organization and segmentation of businesses have opened up opportunities across the company. So we\u2019re able to do this in kind of rifle shots and it\u2019s a kind of thing that in any one place you wouldn\u2019t really notice but when it adds all up it becomes meaningful. So, it really is across the company and by the way that\u2019s on the cost side and that\u2019s also on the investment side. So we\u2019re moving a whole bunch of resources from some areas to other areas all around growth and productivity and so what you seen is we kind of use the term cut and build and that\u2019s how we think about it here. So, it\u2019s pretty broad spread but it\u2019s not any kind of massive swap anywhere. And pretty much all of that stuff would be done by the end of this month for the most part here and there. So, in terms of European municipal still weak, there is no two ways about it, you seen a couple of projects that have come out of the wood works in recent months specifically out of the UK but for the most part it\u2019s still pretty soft. Operator :  Ladies and gentlemen there are no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn the conference back to management for closing remarks. Thank you. Andy Silvernail :  Thanks, Diego. Well, thank you very much for joining us here today obviously we\u2019re proud of the results we have and most importantly really congratulations to the team in the field at IDEX who has continue to execute time and time again. So, we appreciate your support and we look forward to talking to you at the fourth quarter call. Take care Operator : :",

Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2014 IDEX Corporation Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Michael Yates, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer. Thank you. Mr. Yates, you may begin. Michael John Yates : Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. This is Mike Yates, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for IDEX Corporation. Thank you for joining us for a discussion of the IDEX fourth quarter and full year financial highlights. Last night, we issued a press release outlining our company's financial and operating performance for the 3- and 12-month periods ended December 31, 2014.

This call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbor language in today's press release and in IDEX's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Andy Silvernail. Andrew K. Silvernail: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everybody, and I appreciate you joining us for our fourth quarter call and a look at the full year and our outlook. At the end of the day, IDEX had a very strong 2014. We had sales up 6%, that was up 5% organically. Sales and operating margin increased in all 3 segments, and we delivered 16% adjusted EPS growth. We achieved these results in a continued volatile market, and I think we all know that we're seeing that extend into early 2015. But we had outstanding execution. We overdrove productivity, and we've really continued to focus on our core products and customers. And I'm very, very proud of the results that the team has delivered. I'm going to take a minute here and just talk about what we're seeing in the world. I'll break it down in terms of the markets and also the spaces that we play in and talk about geographies. If we look at the -- to the macro environment for 2015, I mean, obviously, we've had a couple of major changes here in the last 90 days. About 1/4 of our business is in Europe and obviously, with the deterioration of the euro and British pound against the dollar, this creates some pretty good-sized headwinds for us as we go into the year, and that equates to about $0.15. And so that's -- it's certainly different than what -- we were with you about 90 days ago. We've also had the drop in oil prices, and that's not a huge impact on our business. We've got about 11% of our business that's in energy of some kind, 2% to 3% or so that's upstream. And longer term, we know there will be good economic benefits that will benefit IDEX as a whole. But in the short term, it is modestly negative to IDEX in 2015. Also, as we have communicated, really, this time last year and throughout all of last year, we knew we had about $50 million of onetime large projects that principally hit in the first half of last year. And so we really have to fill that hole as we go through 2015. Together, these items are worth about $0.35 to $0.40 of headwind through the year. Regardless of that, we're going to grow in 2015. We're going to grow in the top line and we're going to grow in the bottom line. We anticipated a lot of this headwind early into last year, and also, just the work that we've done in terms of segmentation have really prepared our business to continue to grow profitability and to grow organically. In the fourth quarter, we took almost $14 million of cost actions that are going to deliver $15 million of profitability for us in 2015. We really were able to optimize our cost structure, increase our competitiveness and reallocate resources. One of the things that we talk about a lot here in IDEX is the idea of cutting and building. Taking resources from places that aren't as productive, aren't as profitable and moving them aggressively into other areas of the company. And we've done that this year. And we're going to move up to, say, $12 million in continued growth investments throughout the year. So with that, let me take a few minutes and talk about the end markets, the regions around the globe, and then I'll also talk about the acquisition environment. First, in terms of end markets. If you look at Energy and Chemical, in -- specifically, since our third quarter call, obviously, oil prices have fallen dramatically. This impacts principally our energy platform and BAND-IT. And again, about 11% of our business touches the energy world and 2% to 3% is upstream. The -- overall, this impacts mostly our FMT segment. The business, some in Europe and the Middle East are clearly impacted by it and certainly, the BAND-IT business, which does have exposure to downhole drilling. At the end of the day, we don't expect much of a material change into our outlook in 2015. We are assuming that oil prices remain where we are today and the impact to rig counts, et cetera, the negative trend that's happening is going to hold throughout 2015. Our core Energy business and our core Chemical business, however, is doing quite well in North America. There's some softness in Europe but generally, that business is really holding up. The Industrial side is strong. North America is particularly strong, and in these businesses where we are focused in on the core markets, we're delivering new products and we're certainly seeing our ability to take share in those markets. Analytical instrumentation. It's really rebounded from the third quarter of last year. We talked about that principally being an inventory issue. That is exactly what happened and we saw a nice pickup in the fourth quarter, and we expect solid growth here throughout 2015. The Ag market, which this time last year we started talking about the softness and our expectations for that, it has been soft principally in the OEM business. But the aftermarket, which is large and profitable for us, has remained solid, and we expect it to do so through the balance of the year. Finally, on the municipal front, the U.S. business has definitely picked up. The rest of the world hasn't as much, but we have seen a pickup in overall spending in municipal markets. And this has impacted our Water business and certainly, our Rescue business in the U.S. iPEK, which is our pipeline inspection business, has had, really, just an outstanding last 24 months. They've launched a handful of new products that I'm going to talk about later, but they're growing very, very nicely. If we turn to the regions around the world, North America has been solid, and I expect it to be solid in most end markets. But particularly in our Chemical, Industrial and our Instrumentation businesses -- that's been rock solid for us and we expect it to do so for the balance of the year. Europe, a different story. Obviously, it's been soft. It was negative for us as we look at the fourth quarter. We do expect it to grow modestly in -- throughout the balance of 2015. But generally, we think the trends in Europe are going to continue. And that said, the trends in China. China's been soft, also. It's still growing. It is a strategic region for us. We're going to continue to make investments there, but you have to be willing to live with the volatility in that marketplace, and it certainly has been so for the last 18 to 24 months and we think for the balance of this year also. The Middle East is going to be tough. With the drop in oil prices, we expect spending to come down some. And we've expected it -- there to be some kind of -- some contraction in that marketplace throughout the year. With that, let me move to a little bit on capital deployment. So we have very aggressively been reinvesting in the business for both growth and productivity. We increased our CapEx over 50% from 2013 to about $48 million in 2014 and really targeted around how can we accelerate organic growth and how can we continue to drive productivity. And that's why you're seeing a lot of the margin improvement that you've seen, really, in the last few years. A lot of what we're doing is really moving capital to very specific investments that we saw come to fruition here in 2014. We doubled the size of our India facility to meet demand, and that serves multiple platforms. In our Fire business, we have -- we have really targeted new markets for fire suppression trailers in the power generation market, and that was really untapped prior to 2013. Our sealing and our CFP businesses opened new facilities for new product lines that they're going to introduce throughout the year. And Viking expanded its R&D capabilities for, really, new product introductions. These have had really tangible benefits in 2014 and they're going to continue through to 2015, and that's why it's so critical for us to continue to move resources, people and capital to our best businesses. And so we're going to continue to do that in 2015. You should expect from us, from a capital perspective, to continue around 30% of our earnings going into dividends. And also, this year, you should expect about a net 2% decrease in the share count. In 2014, we repurchased about 3 million shares at a cost of $223 million. Finally, let me address what we're seeing in the M&A world. Our funnel of opportunities remain strong and the targets that we're looking at meet our strategic and our financial objectives. The valuation environment hasn't changed, it's still challenging, but we are really pressing on cultivation, and we think that's starting to pay off. And it's our responsibility to make sure that we use the capital intelligently and we really deliver value for you, our shareholders. I'm optimistic about 2015. I will be disappointed if we don't close $250 million of acquisitions in 2015. With that, let me turn to the full year results. I'm on Slide 4. Just as a reminder, this -- all of the information here excludes the impact of the restructuring that we did in the fourth quarter. So revenue for the year was $2.1 billion, up 6%, 5% organically with increases across all of the segments. Orders were also up (sic) $2.1 billion, up 2%, 1% organically. If you look at adjusted operating margin, they were 20.7% for the year, up 120 basis points. Across the board, outstanding results in terms of profitability and the ability to continue to extend margins. A real focus on elimination of complexity and driving productivity across the businesses. Free cash flow was $326 million. That was 117% of net income. And it's worth pointing out that if you look at working capital across the last 3 years, we've taken our working capital down from 22% of sales to 17% of sales this year. So just an outstanding job by our teams. And finally, EPS for the year was $3.57, and that was up 16% on an adjusted basis year-over-year. In the fourth quarter, we had 1% increase in organic orders and 2% increase in sales, really led by FMT and HST. Operating margin was up 60 basis points from the prior year at 20.6% and really just a great job by HST, which has delivered a 470-basis-point margin improvement to 22.9%, which is really just outstanding for the teams. And this, really, across the board in that segment, the businesses really delivered nicely. Free cash flow was down 7% in the quarter and really due to the -- entirely to increased CapEx spending. Adjusted EPS was $0.89 or 9% increase over prior year. Again, these results give us really, really nice momentum as we go into 2015. All right, let me turn to the segment discussions. We'll start with Fluid & Metering. I'm on Slide 5. FMT closed out 2014 with a 3% increase in orders, resulting in 2% for the full year. Organic sales were up 2% in the quarter, again, up 2% for the year. Op margin was flat in the quarter, but it was up 60 basis points to 24.8% for, really, just an outstanding performance. Across the segment, all of the businesses were positive except for Ag. So just a nice job. If you look at Water Services, we've seen, municipal spending, it's growing in the low single digits when you look at it across the globe. But our business has far outpaced that. They've done a great job of segmentation, they're winning share in their core and they're driving organic growth and profitability. iPEK, as I mentioned before, has done a wonderful job with new products. They have delivered a new ROVION system that, in the last 5 years, has really helped them double revenue, and they've grown margins by 1,000 basis points and they've filed 34 patents for that new product. They've delivered over 1,000 systems, and that is relative to only 400 systems that have been delivered in the previous 14 years. So we expect that performance to really continue to and be outstanding in 2015. If you look at Energy, again, our exposure here to foreign oil prices I've talked about. We will see some issues in Europe and the Middle East in particular, but it's a relatively small piece of our business, 2% to 3%, as we mentioned, that's upstream. In the bulk of our business, which is midstream, we're seeing a nice performance and a solid backlog as we go into 2015. Chemical, there is some softness in Europe, but North America, the Distribution business is solid, Asia is solid, and we're seeing really nice performance out of our Viking pump business. And finally, Ag. That is an area of caution for us. We expected it to be soft given what's going on with the OEMs. We were prepared for that, but we're going to see nice growth in the industrial side of that business and we expect that the distribution business will continue to be solid. All right. Let's turn to Slide 6 and let's move on to Health & Science. In the fourth quarter, organic orders were up 2%, organic sales were up 5%. And for the year, HST had 3% organic order growth and 4% organic sales growth. The improvement in operating margins was just outstanding. As I mentioned before, margins were up 470 basis points in the quarter, and they were up 190 basis points for the year. And there were some really excellent contributors in here. I guess, first of all, Scientific Fluidics had a really solid quarter in terms of growth and profitability. Our Optics business had great productivity and continues to move profitability upwards. And our Material Process business had a couple of large projects that have pushed through with great execution and nice profit mix. If you look at Scientific Fluidics, as I've mentioned, we closed out the year real nicely, and we saw that trend move from the -- well, we saw softness in the third quarter to a really nice performance in the fourth quarter as inventories normalized and we saw a regular pull in that business. We see pretty nice tailwinds as we head into 2015. If you look at the bio business and in vitro diagnostics and analytical instrumentation, we think there's a very, very healthy pipeline of businesses coming out in terms of end-market OEM products, and we have continued to win share on those products. If you look at Optics & Photonics, nice -- very nice quarter. We've absolutely seen that business stabilize, and really strong movements and profitability, as we had expected and as we had committed. Also, if you look at the industrial side of what sits in HST, really, great performance, particularly if you look at Gast. That's a business that I had responsibility for when I first joined IDEX, and Eric Ashleman and the team there, within that business, have just done a terrific job of growing sales and profitability. All right. I'm on the final segment, Diversified, and you would want to flip to Slide 7. As we've talked about consistently, our great success in 2013 and most of 2014, we had some large project wins that delivered terrific performance, but obviously, that creates headwind for us in 2015, in particular, really, in the first half and the large Dispensing order that we had was mostly delivered in the first quarter. In the fourth quarter, organic orders were down 7%, and they were down 4% for the full year. Both declines were due to these large nonrecurring orders that I just spoke about. Organic sales for the quarter were down 5% on lower volume in our Dispensing Equipment business but grew 13% organically for the full year. There are some really significant opportunities. We're always going to see pretty significant large projects as we look at Dispensing, Rescue and Fire, and that's going to create difficult comps year-on-year, but we've got great initiatives that are paying off across the segment. BAND-IT's winning in transportation, cable management and industrial. The Dispensing team continues to have really outstanding core growth. We're seeing the X-SMART product, which has been a home run for us, continue to grow in that business. And really, it's one of our most global businesses, and we continue to penetrate markets throughout the world. And finally, if you look at the Fire Suppression group, the team just did an excellent job this year executing on pent-up demand in that trailer business that I mentioned earlier. And we expect that business, while it's going to have a little bit of a dip here versus 2014, that's a business that is going to continue to grow for us and really pay nice dividends. We expect the core business in the U.S. and China to be relatively flat, but we've got a slew of new products that are being brought to market here, and we expect to see growth throughout the year. All right. I'm on Slide 8, and let's talk about the full year guidance. We expect low single-digit organic growth across all the platforms for the year, and that's going to deliver $0.05 to $0.10 of incremental EPS. It's important to note that the $15 million of nonrecurring projects in 2014 present 2 to 3 points organic headwind in 2015. And I know we've talked about that a lot throughout last year, but you can expect to see the vast majority of that in the first half and obviously, a big piece of that here in the first quarter. So if you kind of -- if you balance for that, the 1% to 2% organic growth that we're talking about really looks like 3% to 5% on the core business. The impact of FX that I mentioned before, it really hits us with the euro, the Canadian dollar and the British pound. And that's about $85 million of top line and about $0.15 of EPS. For the full year of 2014, we had a 28.8% tax rate due to a number of onetime items. We don't expect that to continue, and also, with the strength of the U.S. business, our tax rate is going to creep a little bit. We expect 2015 to be 29.5%, which is about a $0.05 headwind if you look at it on a comparative basis. We will continue our share buyback program and that adds about $0.11 in 2015, and then the restructuring action that we took in the fourth quarter will add about $0.14 in the year. Finally, if you look at productivity, net of inflation, that's going to get us about $0.08. Just a great job by our teams really driving net productivity. And then, we're going to continue to make the investments that I spoke about earlier to -- for growth and for productivity, and that's about a $0.10 investment for the year. All right. Let's look at Q1 and full year guidance, I'm on Slide 9. If we look at the estimates, we're talking about $0.81 to $0.83 with an operating margin of about $0.20 in the first quarter. That compares to the $0.91 last year. But keep in mind, in the first half of 2014, and predominantly Q1, we had very strong incremental margins from that large Dispensing order. And this is also compounded a little bit by the -- by, obviously, the strong FX issues that we're seeing here compared to 2014. In Q1, we think the tax rate's going to be 29.5%. We estimate about a 5% top line sales headwind from FX, and that's about $0.05 of EPS versus the prior year. A few more modeling items for you. You should expect about 21% op profit for the year and about $0.15 of FX headwind, which is about 4% top line also for the year. Full year CapEx should be about $45 million. Free cash flow will be about 120% of net income, and you should expect about 2% net share reduction for the year. As always, these earnings don't include any impact from acquisitions, or the cost associated with that, as we look at our guidance for 2015. So with that, let me pause here and turn it over to the operator for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt McConnell, RBC Capital Markets. Matthew W. McConnell - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Could you give us the organic revenue that you're looking for in the first quarter? And then, I wonder if there's a ramp-up through the year built into that, independent of the Dispensing comps. Because the first quarter guidance is only about 22% of your full year guidance, which is lower. So it implies a little bit of a ramp through the year. Is that just FX? Or is there something else in the first quarter? Andrew K. Silvernail: No. You've got -- really, the impact that you're looking at for the year, is that the onetime business impacts really had a very strong balance in the first quarter of last year, and obviously, we had a very strong Q1 of last year. We think organic growth in the first quarter is probably flattish, that's our guess, maybe slightly up, but flat, generally. And as you move through the year, you've got a couple things happening. Number one, we do expect some modest pickup, not dramatically, but some modest pickup in the business. There's some seasonality as you look at the second quarter in particular. And we've got a number of new products that started to hit late last year, and we see ramping up as we get into the second half of last year. So obviously, as you look at the first quarter, that's a pretty big hole relative to last year. It is entirely -- that Dispensing order, but the rest of the businesses are really performing very, very well. Matthew W. McConnell - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay, great. That's helpful. And then so... Andrew K. Silvernail: I just -- one thing. Just to give you a sense of it, in the first quarter alone, from a top line basis, the Dispensing order is a 4-point impact up line. Matthew W. McConnell - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Right. That's for the whole business, not just the segment? Andrew K. Silvernail: No. That's for all of IDEX. Matthew W. McConnell - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Yes, yes. Okay, got it. And then, is there a pipeline of any more of these potential lumpy projects? And the reason I ask is that the projects that are creating the tough comp, they're not exactly fluke. You're investing in new products, in new channels. And so it drove nice growth last year, but is there anything in the pipeline that could be comparable or a repeat of what you saw last year? Andrew K. Silvernail: I don't think -- on the Dispensing side, the answer to that is no. So your -- first of all, you're absolutely right. That is the nature. If you look at Dispensing, and to some degree, Rescue and now with the Trailer business with Fire, you're going to get some of that. That's just kind of part of the business. Dispensing tends to have a little bit more volatility there or change year-to-year because you tend to get large refresh orders from big-box retailers. We have a pretty good view of what's going to happen and when it's going to happen in the year. And so we can see that. I don't see big Dispensing orders this year on a comparable basis to what we saw last year, but if you look at Rescue and you look at Fire, there's always a pipeline. And there is in Dispensing, too. There's always a pipeline. So you're right to say that it's not a fluke. We are investing in new products, and it's absolutely what allows us to do that. So if you look at the Rescue business, if you look at Fire and if you look at Dispensing, all of the big wins that we've talked about really were because of outstanding new products and very, very good service operations. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Andy, Heath, if we could talk a little bit about energy. I know you're primarily downstream, refined products. Can you talk -- I'm sure this is not baked into your guidance or anything, but could you talk about the potential for any kind of increased demand there based on the fact that oil has gone down so gasoline has gone down? The potential for you, as [ph] people, to drive more of that kind of stuff? And the impact that could possibly have on your business. Andrew K. Silvernail: So we've -- as you might imagine, we've looked at that pretty hard. I think the issue that you have within the window that we're talking about, which is let's just put it in the bracket in 2015, is you have a relatively dramatic negative impact in the first half of the year just because of projects either being put on hold or being slowed down, et cetera. And the residual impact of -- was effectively a giant tax cut across the world and the money coming back into the system. That just takes longer to prime the pump. And so I expect the benefits of that to be potentially late in this year and then as we look at 2016 and beyond, if this continues. So if you net it out, I think it's actually a net positive for IDEX over a couple of years. But certainly, in the first half and principally in 2015, it's a slight net negative. Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Yes, that's what I would have thought, too. So you take a little bit of pain upfront and -- for a little bit of gain down the road. Andrew K. Silvernail: Yes, I think that's right. Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : You guys have done a fantastic job over the last few years increasing productivity, increasing margins and targeting these growth investments. You called out $12 million in 2015. Can you give us a little bit more color on where that's going? Andrew K. Silvernail: Yes. So -- and so we called out $12 million that hits the P&L. But also, if you look at the $45 million in CapEx, we did $48 million this year, we'll do $45 million next year, which is up meaningfully from our historical run rate, I mean still not a big number really, a huge amount of that money is going to growth and productivity. So if you know -- focusing in on the $12 million. It's really going into the front end of the business, so in a few places. It's going to sales channel development, so feet-on-the-street, and the development of distribution. Mostly incremental distribution outside of the U.S. and Europe. We've got outstanding historical distribution in those 2 regions. But if you look at other parts of the world, it still has got to mature. So there's money going into there. More money going into new product development, engineering talent principally that we're building out. And there are 5 or 6 businesses in particular that we are pushing more money into because we think the profit pools and the growth aspects of that are really outstanding. And that would be if you look at our Viking business, as an example. Our energy platform, even though it's having some struggles today, we're putting more money into CFP, into energy. We're putting more money into Scientific Fluidics and into Optics. And then -- and I'm just talking about the things here that are kind of incremental to some of the investments that we've made before. But principally, the $12 million is going into the front end of the business. Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. And then, just looking at HST, you've got margins at the highest level since you bought CVI, which was dilutive to margins, and as far as I can see, the second highest quarter ever for that business. Can you talk about what -- and I assume that means that the non-CVI businesses continued to expend margins through that. Can you talk about how sustainable margins are at this level? What kind of long-term target you think you can get to in that business? Andrew K. Silvernail: So a couple of things. First of all, you're absolutely right in talking about the op margin. But if you looked at it on EBITDA basis, it's actually well ahead of any record [ph] EBITDA margin basis. So really a great job. It's not one business, right? So certainly, the Optics business has continued to improve profitability. But if you look at Scientific Fluidics, if you look at Material Process, if you look at the Sealing business, if you look at Gast and Micropump, every single one of those has seen margin expansion in this year and in the quarter. So it's pretty broad-based. And it comes down to a real focus in on a couple of things. Number one, really, a tight view of segmentation where we're really understanding where the profit pools are and where growth can come from. It's investments in productivity. So we're seeing a nice mix change within each of the businesses in terms of more profitable business, and we're also seeing some really nice productivity gains. Just one example of that, and I think this is a wonderful example, is when I joined IDEX in 2009, the Gast business, since that time, profit margins in that business have doubled. That's just an example of that. And I think they're just a wonderful example of being able to consistently drive profit improvement. Now in terms of sustainability at this level, I think this is a little bit high. If I look at the first quarter, first quarter margins will be down sequentially from the fourth quarter, just with the nature of mix of the business and some volume. But I think you should expect margins that are consistently in this neighborhood. North of 21%, 21%, 22% based on how we're performing today. And by the way, we have an expectation that margins will continue to get better over time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Jefferies. R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : I was hoping that you could tell us about price versus cost this quarter. How was pricing? Andrew K. Silvernail: Yes. We're still getting nice price. Heath, what was the total? Heath A. Mitts: Excuse me, Scott. Price for the year for 2014 was somewhere around 1.1%, 1.2% gross. So relative to the inflationary pressures, so that outpaced the inflationary side by, let's call that, 0.5 points or so. As we look for '15 --- and I'd say it was consistent quarter-to-quarter, Scott. So it wasn't a spike in any one quarter. It was pretty consistent. Most of our price increases tend to go out in the announced and then effective kind of a November, December, January time frame. So largely, the price increases that we expect in 2015 are in place, and we've got a pretty good feel for what's going to stick relative to that. So we still feel pretty good about our ability to outpace input pricing pressures or inflationary pressures on that side, on the material side, specifically, by another, let's call it, 0.3 to 0.5 of a point. R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Okay. Could you also tell us how much of your organic growth in 2014 was attributable to higher oil as an end market? I know it's in the 10% of sales, right, so I'm sure it wasn't much. But was that a needle mover for you on the top line? Andrew K. Silvernail: Not really, not really. The impact that we're seeing here for the year, it's probably, net-net, it's probably 1 point of organic growth that we're being impacted by in '15 from what we're seeing, plus or minus. But I'd have a hard time kind of giving you what the incremental '14 over '13 was relative to the oil price. R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Fair enough. Last question. You mentioned, Andy, that you'd be disappointed if you didn't close $250 million of acquisitions. The first question is : a, I'm assuming that, that's outlays as opposed to sales; and b, could you tell us more about that? I mean, could you give us something a little bit more granular on that confidence, sizes, that kind of thing? How close you are to the altar here? Andrew K. Silvernail: Well, so you're right. First of all, the $250 million that I talked about is certainly outlaid. The -- my confidence level comes from two things : Number one, the things that are in our funnel today, and we really look at it like a sales funnel almost, are things that are really cultivated businesses. So they're not auctions. So anytime you're -- what you're dealing with this deep into the funnel and they're auctions, you just don't know how it's going to go, where these are really proprietary deals that are -- we've cultivated over a long period of time. And so we feel pretty good. We've got a few right now that are -- that, really, we're at kind of the end stages. That being said, things do happen. There's -- we've got a couple of deals that we feel great about, and we think we can get them over the finish line here in the not-too-distant future. That certainly wouldn't get us to the total $250 million that we're talking about, but I feel very, very good about the funnel that we have in general. R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Would you say that there are deals that are close or, let's say, within the hope for $250 million that are in excess of $100 million in sales? Andrew K. Silvernail: In sales? No, no. Not in sales. The -- in aggregate, if we deploy the $250 million, it should add over $100 million in sales. But the stuff that we're far down the pipeline today, none of them are over $100 million themselves. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Allison Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : On working capital, you made a nice move to that 17% range. As you look across your businesses, is that a good run rate? Do you still see some room for improvement there? Can you talk about that a little bit? Andrew K. Silvernail: Yes. So the 17%, 15% in businesses like ours is truly kind of world-class. So I think the 17% is -- I'll put it in a very good category. That being said, as you might imagine, across the distribution, we've got some businesses that are running in the 10% range and even a couple that are actually in the single digits. And then we've got a couple outliers that are actually in the mid-20s. And so while I -- certainly, I don't think we've got 500 basis points of improvement in us. We've got 2 or 3 good-sized businesses that are in the mid-20s that really should be businesses that are in low-20s, high teens. So we got some room. Allison Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Great, great. And then just turning to Fire & Safety and Diversified. I think you guys had talked about 24% of EBIT margins as a fairly decent run rate. As we look to '15, obviously, challenges abounded potentially with energy and those large orders not recurring. I mean, should we be thinking a level lower than that this year? Andrew K. Silvernail: Plus/minus. I don't see that a lot different. I think you've got -- if you look across the businesses, BAND-IT will get hit a little bit on the energy side, but they'll still grow. So net-net, they'll still grow that business. So I feel pretty good about that. The core Dispensing business, so the non -- I shouldn't call it core, really, the non-project business is growing nicely and the underlying profitability has continued to improve. The Fire business, in the last 3 years, we've improved profitability by 1,000 basis points. So it's -- we've made a nice run there. Heath, what would you add to that? Heath A. Mitts: No, I think largely it balances out that -- just followed Andy's comments. I think we'll probably -- this business, and I've said this before in these calls, this particular segment feels the pinch of mix more poignantly than almost anything we have in our other portfolio just because you have 4 distinct businesses in there with different profit profiles, albeit all very impressive. It's just a couple of those businesses, specifically Rescue and BAND-IT, tend to be much more profitable than Dispensing and Fire. Having said that, some of the things that, from a project perspective, that are coming off this year versus last year are being replaced with things that we feel pretty good about mix-wise. So even though we're going to feel a top line pressure there, to hold margins in the mid-20s, I think, is very reasonable there. Operator : The next question is from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research. Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Just touching more on, I guess, Chemical and midstream in North America which, it sounds like, you feel pretty confident about despite what's going on. Just curious, as far as your, I guess, your participation and maybe your sensitivity to the markets, I mean, are you more, I guess, related to ongoing utilization and activity rather than new projects? Maybe just start there. Andrew K. Silvernail: Yes. So the core of our business, as we look at energy, is really around custody transfer and metering. And so we tend -- if you look at our -- this business over time, when the energy markets are booming, the question we always get is why isn't your energy business growing as fast? And when things struggle, we tend to outperform. And so it just doesn't have the same beta that the overall energy market has. So we tend to be custody transfer, we tend to be more metering. We're not as driven by the project business. And actually, if you look at the growth of that business, pre -- kind of what we've seen happen here in the last 6 months, that's been kind of a mid- to high single-digit grower for us for the last 3 or 4 years. And really, on the back of excellent kind of day-to-day business, not big project business. Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: So to the extent we do start to see some maybe deferrals or cancellations of new projects, you don't anticipate that to impact your outlook much? Andrew K. Silvernail: You'll see some of it. So as an example, last year, as the issues in the Middle East really started to pick up, our Sampi business, which is dealing a lot with skids, that business really dropped off. And that's at kind of a historical low for us right now. And so that's kind of impacted. But generally, if you -- large-scale cancellations, we're not playing in the downhole or in the rig side very much. It's kind of 2%, 3% of the business. So it just won't have the volatility that people who are really exposed to upstream have. Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Okay. And then just coming back to the price cost. So I think you mentioned you still anticipate some inflationary pressures. I mean, just kind of looking at a lot of the primary commodities, you are seeing deflation, not inflation. Are you just locked in to some of these costs for a period of time? And if we remain at levels we are today, you would anticipate that to start to be a tailwind at some point? Andrew K. Silvernail: Not -- we don't have very many locked contracts. I mean, we have a couple of things with some specialties metals that are locked in and some motors contract, as an example, that are -- that have longer lead times to influence those things. But it's not really big. One of the -- if you kind of look at our overall supply, our supply chain, it looks like, frankly, how we deliver to the marketplace, right? So we're buying relatively small lots of things. And so the overall kind of price pressure on either side of the equation is never really big, unless you have something kind of really crazy happening in the marketplaces, which, historically, has not happened. The other side of inflation, right, is just, wage inflation. So if you look at just -- if you kind of start a year and you expect to have kind of normal wage inflation and very, very modest input inflation, for us that's kind of a $25-ish million number that you walk into the year with, right, that you got to cover. So the $8 million in net productivity that we're talking about, what that really means is we're taking out kind of $33 million to $35 million of gross cost, and we're netting $8 million. And so -- sorry, $0.08 a share, so it's a little bit more than that. So it's a nice number that we're getting in total productivity. Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Got you. Okay, great. And so the net productivity of the $0.08 includes the spread between the price and -- price and cost? Andrew K. Silvernail: Absolutely, yes. And wage inflation. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Charley Brady with BMO. Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets Canada : Can you give us -- and if you've said this, I'm sorry if I missed it, just the -- if you exclude those onetime projects, what the organic growth would have been in the Diversified business, Fire & Safety and Diversified? And kind of what the orders would have been -- looked like if you x out those kind of onetime stuff? Andrew K. Silvernail: Are you talking for '15 or for '14, Charley? Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets Canada : I'm talking what we saw in Q4 and for the year. Andrew K. Silvernail: Oh, okay, okay. Yes. Q4 doesn't have a big impact. So Q4, the vast majority of what we're talking about here happened in, from a sales perspective and a profit perspective, happened in the first half of '14. And it really includes the Dispensing and the Trailers piece. Those 2 big pieces happened, really, early in the year. So not much impact here in the third, fourth quarter. A little bit in the third, not a lot in the fourth. And the orders impact actually was in 2013, right? Because those orders happened in the third, fourth quarter of 2013, they got shipped in the first, second quarter of '14. Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets Canada : Okay. So that -- I guess, what I'm looking at is that 7% decline in Fire & Safety and Diversified. Is that mostly coming out of Dispensing, which tends to have a lot higher European exposure? Andrew K. Silvernail: That's exactly right. Heath A. Mitts: That's exactly right, Charley. Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets Canada : Okay. All right. Can you give me the share -- what the share count was at the end of the year rather than the average? Heath A. Mitts: 78.8 million. Andrew K. Silvernail: Yes. So the actual closing number is 78.8 million. The average number we're looking at is, what, 78.2 million for -- it's kind of low 78s for the full year -- yes. 78.2 million is what we're looking at for 2015. Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets Canada : Fully diluted, correct? Andrew K. Silvernail: Yes. yes. Weighted. Yes, fully... Heath A. Mitts: Full year, fully diluted weighted average share is 78.2 million, about. Operator : The next question is from the line of Kevin Maczka with BB&T. Kevin R. Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : Can we just touch on the restructuring again a little bit more? You've been doing a nice job on productivity, and you expect more of that in the new year. But the -- in Q4, we had formal restructuring in all 3 segments. Can you just give a little more detail there on what was done? Is this all footprint related? And I think I know the answer, but is this it as far as the foreseeable actions in 2015? Andrew K. Silvernail: So we started -- Kevin, we started looking at this in kind of the late spring of 2014. And what really allowed us to do this is the great work we've done in terms of complexity reduction across our businesses. And it really availed the opportunities to get more competitive with the cost structure and to move resources, more resources in to growth. And so we started looking at -- in the kind of late spring of the year, and we really wanted to make sure that we got it done before the end of 2014. The numbers that we're talking about here are principally, wage-related, right? So the $14 million or $15 million of savings -- $0.14 is principally wage-related. And by the way, that included the businesses and corporate. It -- so that was -- it was across the entire corporation that we're able to take a hard look at it. In terms of other things, nothing on the table today. I will tell you that we're kind of always looking at opportunities where we can do that. And certainly, any meaningful acquisition would give us opportunity to go after that. So we're not planning on -- we're not serial restructurers. That's not our gig. But if we get the opportunity to take a big chunk of cost out, we're going to do it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Radigan with KeyBanc. Joseph K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Andy, you've talked about the -- making your own luck for a while now. Do you track, or are you able to quantify how much organic growth you think is coming from share gains, new products, geographic expansion, all that stuff you're investing in versus the underlying market growth rate? Or how do you think about that? Andrew K. Silvernail: So our goal has really been, how do you find 200 to 300 basis points above market. How do you do that. And if you look at, say, let's call it the 2000 to 2010, that time frame, or maybe even 2000 to 2012, we delivered just under 1 point of incremental growth above what we'd look at our market growth. And we want to get another 100 to 200 basis points above that. What I would say is, certainly, over the last couple of years, I'm going to -- I have to kind of break it down specifically, but I bet it's 1.5 points that we've gotten incrementally from the growth investments over and above market growth, maybe 2 points. So I feel pretty good about the benefits that we're getting there. The -- and if you remember back in late 2012, we also moved a bunch of cash, a bunch of money into growth initiatives. And throughout 2013 and 2014, those happened in smaller ways, the reallocation. But the $12 million that we're talking about reallocating here is some bigger chunks of opportunity. So I want to get 200 to 300 basis points above market. I think that would be outstanding. It would -- it'd drive tremendous value for our customers and for shareholders. Joseph K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then, so maybe as a follow-on to that. So excluding that project activity that your guidance is -- the core -- maybe the core organic growth rate in your guidance is 3% to 5%. Is any of that baked in there? Or do you think that's -- do you think it's upside to that number if you can continue to succeed kind of with these initiatives? Andrew K. Silvernail: Well, I -- so I think the 3% to 5% is going to be 200 to 300 basis points above market. If you just kind of look at the global markets. If we nail that core 3% to 5%, we're going to have delivered on that promise. I feel good about that. Now the $12 million that we're putting to work here, that really kind of comes out of the restructuring that we're doing, that's going to show up in '16 and '17. We've talked about this before. One of -- the beauties of IDEX, and why we have such outstanding fundamental economics in the business from a cash perspective and from an income perspective, is the stickiness of the markets and the highly engineered nature of what we do. The downside to that is that market share, the downside from an offensive perspective is market share moves glacially in these businesses and new-product adoption is very, very slow because our customers tend to be pretty conservative. And so if you look at kind of what I call full absorption rate of a new product, it can be 2 to 5 years of any business. So the investments that we're making today are really going to show up in '16 and '17. I mean, one way to look at this is you say, \"Hey, you know what? We're not going to make these investments. We're going to take the $0.05 to $0.10, and we're going to put it in our pocket and cover the FX headwind,\" right? So if you look at the numbers that we have, 100% of the difference between kind of what you guys were calling and where we are today is FX. 100% of that is FX. So we could have kind of put that in our pocket. And frankly, we -- for 2015, that would be fine, but we'll lose the opportunity to accelerate organic growth, continue to accelerate organic growth in '16, '17 and beyond. Joseph K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : That makes a lot of sense. So maybe just last for me. You've been a little more cautious on China for a while now, too, probably ahead of the curve in that regard. Can you talk a little bit more about the tone you're seeing there currently? I know you said it's still choppy, but can you frame that a little bit? Does that mean you expect sort of a continued deceleration in growth? Or are you seeing any signs that maybe there's some stabilization there or even improvement in '15? Andrew K. Silvernail: So I was there later in the year. I was kind of -- November -- in November of the year. And what I would say is that, I mean, obviously, the headline growth rates that are talked about in China are not real, right? Fundamentally, they're inflated numbers, right? And I think that the underlying number that we kind of look at is probably a market growth rate in our type of businesses that's kind of 5-ish percent. That would be my estimate. And -- but with that, it's really lumpy. And as an example, one of the things that's driving lumpiness right now is the anticorruption probes. That's lasted longer and it's even more impactful than we would -- than we thought, really, last year. And what's happened is, as that happens -- and the best example it impacts us is our Dinglee business in Rescue. You see procurement offices kind of shut down as -- when they -- when those probes kind of work themselves through. So there are a lot of things that are non -- that are more policy-related than they are purely economic-related that impact that. So the net of that is, I think it's kind of a mid-single-digit market growth rate in our businesses with lumpiness. And what we say internally and what we say externally is, when I think 10 years from now, that's going to be a much bigger business for us. It's going to be -- it is profitable today, it's going to be profitable in the future. We've got to be there, but you have to live with the volatility. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Douglass with Longbow. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC : Andy, did I hear you right? You said you expect low single-digit organic across all the segments? Andrew K. Silvernail: Yes, for the year. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC : Yes, for the year? Andrew K. Silvernail: Yes, pretty much, yes. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC : Oh, okay. It's a little -- could you talk about that? It seems a little surprising. I guess I figured it can't be the... Andrew K. Silvernail: No. I mean, well, the -- Diversified's going to have some challenges, right, for the first half, so I apologize. I don't -- Let me backtrack that. The first half, Diversified's going to be challenged. If you look at HST, at FMT, they're going to kind of be low to mid-single digit. And FST, I think when you look at the first half, which is going to have a dramatic impact, that will be strongly negative. And then, it will be kind of flat to down a couple points in total for the year. So I apologize for the confusion, Mark. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Yes, that's kind of what I was thinking, reflected down on the others. Reasonably good growth, even HST probably outgrows everybody... Andrew K. Silvernail: Yes, I think so. I think you'll see HST and FMT have pretty solid years. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC : Okay, great. And then looking at the profitability in HST some more, you mentioned IOP is -- has really turned the corner -- well more than turned the corner. It's doing a lot better. But -- and I know that was a big project for a couple of years, but you still are spending or spent almost $5 million on HST. I was surprised you spent a lot more in that business given how well it's already running. What did you do there? What did you see there that could make that business even better? Andrew K. Silvernail: I think where you've got to start from, really, in all of these businesses is kind of what is, what I call, the economic potential of these businesses. And across HST -- and really, I mean, all of IDEX, but HST, specific to this conversation, you have very, very high contribution margins. And so there are kind of 2 ways of driving profitability from that. One, obviously, is volume and holding down the cost base. So you get tremendous flow-through on that. The other one is when you have those high contribution margins, there's a lot of room between contribution margin and op profit to go and drive productivity. And so we've been making very strong overall investments in productivity across the platforms in HST, and it's paying off. IOP, as an example, this is a business that is now in the 23%, 24% EBITDA range. It's -- so really, that's a business that has, to your point, has more than turned the corner, and we really love the overall profitability of that business. It's exactly what we thought it would be. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. And then, Heath, what's the capacity available for M&A or share repurchases? Heath A. Mitts: Well, I mean, the balance sheet is not going to be a gating item, given where our leverage is, given where -- how much cash we have on the balance sheet today and with our strong cash generation that we've always had as a corporation. We could, in theory. I mean, the number's somewhere between $1.5 billion and $2 billion of deployment over, say, a 2- to 3-year period. That's not the gating item. As Andy mentioned earlier, we're going to intelligently increase our dividend as appropriate. We're going to intelligently do the share buybacks, and we're going to stay disciplined on the acquisitions, albeit we feel pretty good about where we are in terms of getting some things done this year. And as Andy mentioned earlier, we'd be disappointed if we didn't deploy at least $250 million towards M&A this year. So the gating item is really more finding and -- the right acquisitions and opportunities that fit our strategic profiles as well as our financial expectations. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC : Right, right. Yes. Certainly a financing issue. I'm just kind of wondering if -- $250 million sounded like what Andy thinks... Andrew K. Silvernail: Yes. I mean, I... Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC : And can we really -- you could certainly do more. Andrew K. Silvernail: Yes, absolutely. And there are things in our funnel that are meaningfully larger than that, right? It's just -- they're difficult to do, right? They are tightly held businesses that people don't necessarily want to part with. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen. Joseph Giordano - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : I think everyone appreciates how clean you always present your financials and you take it on a chin in terms of restructuring into the P&L. And I'm just curious as to how the internal discussion goes as to when you make a decision to call something out. Like, is it just simply the magnitude of the actions? Andrew K. Silvernail: Yes, it really is. And we even had the debate this time around, right? And we just said, \"Hey, it's -- there'd be too much noise on an ongoing basis if we didn't kind of talk about it explicitly.\" So it really is the magnitude. It's not uncommon for us throughout any one year to eat a few million dollars in kind of ongoing restructuring stuff that we do, right? And we don't talk about it, whether it's facility consolidation or moving a business, et cetera. We typically just kind of ease it in the P&L. But when it's this big, we felt it was just really appropriate to talk about it. Joseph Giordano - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Okay. So there was nothing like strategically different about this type of restructuring, it was just -- it was -- the size of it was just larger. Okay. Andrew K. Silvernail: Really, I think the important thing here is it's spread across the businesses, right? So there's -- this is not kind of 2 or 3 things that we did. It really is spread across all 3 segments. Joseph Giordano - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then just lastly, on the M&A. Maybe a -- if you guys can provide a little bit of color without hurting your positioning here. So where are you seeing the best kind of opportunities? Whether it's on an end market perspective or it's on a geographic perspective, any sort of color there would be helpful. Andrew K. Silvernail: So I would say that the European deals are probably the best priced. The key for us there, though, is -- and we're looking at a number of them today, is if we're going to do a European-based acquisition, it's got to be something that principally -- or not principally but has a very, very strong export component to it. And that's meaningful to us, both in its existing business and our ability to globalize it. To buy a business, that's principally selling into Europe, that's not a great positioning. The valuation is both -- obviously, the currency but just overall valuations in local currency are more attractive, there's no doubt about that. U.S. businesses are certainly at a premium. You're seeing stronger overall organic growth. We haven't yet seen multiples come down in the energy space. And frankly, we're looking pretty strongly at that. We've got a great funnel in the energy space. We think long term that's a place we want to be, and we're hopeful that, with kind of what's going on here, corrects some of the -- frankly, some ridiculous multiples of that have been out there for a couple of years. But in our Chemical, Food & Process, really, nice funnel of businesses there. Throughout HST, we've got a nice funnel of businesses that are more global. Those businesses tend to be more global, anyway. And really, nothing big in Diversified. Historically, we haven't looked at a lot of acquisitions in the Diversified segment, although there are a few things that are nice strategic add-ons that we would do. Operator : At this time, I will turn the floor back to Mr. Andrew Silvernail for closing comments. Andrew K. Silvernail: Well, thank you, all, for joining the call today. I mean, obviously, we're really pleased with how 2014 turned out, and really, just congratulations to the team here at IDEX throughout the businesses that have really delivered consistently. I think they've done a great job. As we look at 2015, obviously, that -- the first half of the year, we have comp challenges. We've known that, we've been talking about it with you guys for a while here, but we feel very, very good about what's happened in the underlying businesses from an organic perspective, certainly from a profitability and cash perspective and also, our ability to deploy more capital than we have in M&A over the last few years. So I appreciate your support, and we will talk to you here in 90 days. Take care. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

This call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbor language in today's press release and in IDEX's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Andy Silvernail. Andy Silvernail : Thanks Mike. Good morning everybody. I appreciate you joining us here for our first quarter call in 2015. As we look at the first quarter really the conversation has been dominated by some of the bigger issues that are floating around the macro environment. Obviously the strength of the dollar, the fall in oil prices and what I call a continuing overall slow economic environment. With those items as a backdrop, I\u2019m very proud of the quarter that we just delivered. We just delivered $0.84 in earnings, with an Op margin of 20.3%. We had 2% organic order growth and we built $22 million of backlog. We had organic sales and Op margin improvement include metering and in Health & Science we had organic order growth and really outstanding profit execution and improving operating margin.  As you know, we foresaw a lot of the issues that we are all living with right now last year. We took very aggressive cost actions in the back end of the year and certainly has prepared us for the environment that we are in and I think again our ability to get ahead of the curve with some challenging items.  We all know that we had these discreet comps that we are comparing against here this year with the Dispensing in particular and the macro environment that I just mentioned. But we did see some, I would say some decline here in the overall environment as we move to the second quarter and I\u2019ll talk about this in more detail in the segment review. But the combination, the agricultural market thus being slower, the increasing impact of the dollar and while we\u2019ve seen some slowdown and some large capital projects are going to hit us by about $0.15 compared to what we talked about here in fourth quarter and so we\u2019ve revised our guidance to 350 to 360.  As always, we are very focused on controlling our own destiny. We can\u2019t control the overall macro environment and what you\u2019ll see in this quarter and what you\u2019ll see for the balance of the year is outstanding execution on the profit side, with the real focus on our key products and our key customers. Our core business remains very solid and we are focused on delivering for our customers with real world-class execution and so as I walk through the items here in the first quarter call, we\u2019ll certainly highlight those pieces of that.  Before we get into the segment discussion, let me just talk about what we are seeing around the world and also around capital deployment. In North America, as I mentioned the Ag markets and the energy markets as we all know have been soft. But that said, our daily book-and-term [ph] business remains solid and we expect it to be so throughout the year. The one thing that I do think is a little bit different than when we talked to you a year or quarter ago is that we have seen some slowdown on the capital side, capital spending and we are keeping a pretty close eye on that. It\u2019s not widespread at this time. It\u2019s really focused around our Material Process business and in the energy facing markets, but we are certainly paying attention to it.  Europe. Europe remains a touch slog generally, but we did see a modest pickup here, specifically in our business that touch the municipal markets and we saw that in China too. But we did see a slight uptick. I certainly wouldn\u2019t call it sustained improved, but we did see a modest uptick.  China as I mentioned a moment ago, the reported numbers that we all see, they really don\u2019t show themselves on the industrial side, with the exception on the municipal markets which have improved. The China markets really remain consistent with what we\u2019ve seen here for the last year or so.  With that, let me turn to capital deployment. We have talked about a very balanced capital deployment plan with four pillars to our plan that remain unchanged. The first is we are always going to fully invest in organic growth and we continued to make meaningful investments around our core products and our core customers. I\u2019ll touch on some of those as we move through the segment discussion and we do think that will continue to allow us to differentiate over time and continue to really go after the most attractive profit pools in our markets and our customers.  You saw on April 8 we increased our dividend by 14% at $0.32 a share. That we are committed to being in that 30% range and we are a little bit higher than we have historically been right now. But with our outstanding cash flows and our great balance sheet, we thought that was a prudent move.  In terms of share repurchases, we would expect it will be kind of net 2%, 3% this year as we move through the year and in the first quarter we repurchased 830,000 shares at a cost of $62 million.  The final pillar to our capital deployment plan is strategic M&A, and this continues to be a very important part of our overall capital deployment strategy and our business strategy. And you saw yesterday that we signed the agreement to acquire Novotema. We\u2019ve been talking to Novotema for over a year. As a matter of fact we\u2019ve looked at this business a couple of times over time and we finally were able to get an agreement signed. We expect it will close in the neighborhood of 45 days pending regulatory approval.  This is an outstanding business. It fits squarely within our precision sealing platform. It marries the materials capability of PPE with some really outstanding manufacturing capability within Novotema and as a matter of fact we had been in partnership with them touching a number of end markets before we agreed to acquire the business. We are going to pay 57 million Euro. It\u2019s about 30 million Euro in sales. Highly profitable and after the impact of typical acquisition related costs it will be accretive out of the gates. Please keep in mind that our guidance for the balance of the year does not include any of the costs for the benefits of Novotema.  As you look at the rest of our M&A pipeline, it really is quite strong and I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s any change necessarily in the markets, but a lot of the hard work we\u2019ve been doing here for a long time is coming forward. And as I talked about in the last call, we expect to spend north of $250 million this year and we remain committed to that vote.  With that, let\u2019s move to slide four and we\u2019ll talk about the overall financial performance. Orders were $524 million that was down 2%, but it was up 2% organically and we had improvement in all three segments. We had revenue of $502 million, which was down 8%, down 4% organically and we had Op margins that were down 60 basis points to 20.3%.  Obviously we\u2019ve been talking for a long time about how the first quarter would shape up and the fact there was a very difficult comp. As you know, we had the majority of that large Dispensing order fulfilled in the first quarter of last year and so that makes certainly for very difficult sales comps, but also margin comps, because as you can imagine that flows through at a nice profit level.  Cash flow for the quarter was $43 million. That was down $14 million from last year, but it really is impacted by principally a retirement or assuming a pension payment that typically falls in the second quarter and it happened to fall in the first quarter this year. So, on an operational basis very much in line with our expectations. And finally, EPS for the quarter was $0.84 and that was down 8% compared to last year. With that, let\u2019s turn to the segment discussion. I\u2019m on slide five and we\u2019ll start with the Fluid & Metering. So FMT closed the quarter at a 1% increase in organic orders and a 1% increase in organic sales. They improved Op margin by 30 basis points. Again, just really good execution across the board and the impact of the restructuring actions that we took in the balance of last year. The chemical markets, the petro chemical and the chemical markets remained consistently strong in Europe and North America. We are optimistic throughout this year. We see through our distribution and through the pipeline of business that should remain solid for us through the balance of 2015.  In particular Viking has just done a great job. The team of Viking in terms of sales, profit execution, customer intimacy, they really have been nailing it here for quite some time and did so again here in the first quarter. Water services; again, I mentioned the improvement in the municipal business really globally and we are seeing that in water services. But on a discreet basis, the ROVION system that we launched in our iPEK business has been a real winner for us and a great example of our investments in organic growth and they\u2019ve taken nice chunks of market share and really shows what you do when you focus on driving great products.  Energy, our midstream business is pretty good for a book and term basis. It\u2019s really that the large capital stuff is closer to the well head that has been down really on a global basis and that\u2019s going to be throughout the balance of this year. Not a surprise to us and that team is certainly managing their business for that new demand pattern. Finally Ag. I would say this is one place that did surprise us a little bit in the first. We knew that the Ag market was soft, we had been preparing for that. But we did see even a more rapid decline in the OEM Ag business than we had expected.  The overall distribution business and the industrial business remains good, and I think it\u2019s important to remember that Banjo has just been a great performer for us for years. It\u2019s a terrific business, highly profitable and they will manage their way through what we all expected and certainly will turn at some point here, but it will be a challenge for the balance of the year.  With that, let\u2019s go to slide six on Health & Science. We had 2% organic order growth in the quarter. Organic sales were flat, but really just outstanding profit expedition. Up 150 basis points improvements in productivity, a great job of really going after the most attractive profit pools with new products and also the benefits of the restructuring that we went after last year. Scientific Fluidics, in particular the analytical instrumentation market remains good and we expect it to be so for the balance of year. They came into the year with a nice backlog and they go into the second quarter again in a nice position.  Optics & Photonics remain stable. Terrific profit execution as we talked about it in the last quarter. This business is now from a profitability stand point where we expected it to be and demand remains stable. Industrial, the book and termbusiness is good, so the more industrial facing pieces of HST remains pretty good and we expect it will be for the balance of the year.  The concerning spot for us is really metrical process technologies. As you know, this is a longer cycle business, more exposed to capital projects and we did see a weak quarter in orders and sales and given our visibility, we know how that will play out through the balance of the year in terms of overall sales, and so we have a pretty good mark on what that will weigh in for the year.  Let\u2019s go to our last segment, that\u2019s Diversified, I\u2019m on slide seven. So organic orders were up 2% and as you all know, we expected a substantial headwind on the sales front which is down 16% organically. And of course that flows itself through as it impacts the margin for that large dispending order, so Op margins were down 340 basis points, but down from a really incredible level last year, so we are still north of 25% in that business.  So we\u2019ve talked a lot about the large dispensing order, don\u2019t need to go through that again, but as you look past that, you see continuing, really a strong business profile there. Europe has gotten better in the dispensing business, and the X marked product that we launched here a couple of years ago continues to really be a juggernaut for us. It\u2019s been a great new product and like the ROVION, a great example of investing in core products for businesses, markets that we know well and great execution.  Fire suppression. The North America and the UK are solid, no indicators of softness there. China has been a little bit soft, but we are expecting that to pick up here as we look to the balance of the year with some of the improvement in municipal spending.  Rescue; we\u2019ve actually got some nice momentum. We talked about last year really that being soft spot for us and first time in a long time that that business had not seen the kind of robust growth that we were used to. We\u2019ve seen some momentum here in the first quarter and as we look in the pipeline, whether it\u2019s in North American business of the success of the eDRAULIC or some of the turnaround in the Asian markets, we are seeing some improvement there. The concern and this is a rarity for us, has been BAND-IT. BAND-IT is one of our businesses that has a decent exposure to oil and gas and they have been hit by that. They are industrial business. Their kind of book and term business remains good, but they have been impacted and the one thing I certainly know about the BAND-IT business is they know how to perform regardless of the market and we expect them to turn that around as we move through the year. All right, let\u2019s go to slide eight and let\u2019s talk about guidance. As I stated before, we are revising our guidance for the year to 350 to 360 and I\u2019m going to walk you through kind of the discreet pieces of this and hopefully that will help you out here as you think about how we\u2019re considering the guidance.  The first is really the impact of the dollar. So versus where we were in the fourth quarter call to where we are now, that\u2019s about a $0.06 headwind for us through the balance of the year and in total is about $0.21 for the full year. So obviously from a top line standpoint, we thought that the changes in dollar was going to hit us by about $85 million and now it\u2019s going to hit us somewhere in the $110 million range at current FX rates and that flows through at kind of 20%-ish plus or minus. It\u2019s mostly translational impact with all translational impact, but obviously that\u2019s a big headwind as we look through the balance of the year. Ag, just given the very high profitability of Banjo and where that\u2019s playing out, that\u2019s going to hit us by about $0.04 incrementally through the balance of the year and as we look at these large projects, whether its Material Process or some of the more energy facing, that\u2019s about $0.05 and so again, in total it\u2019s about $0.15 compared to where we were at the fourth quarter. All right, let me go to the final slide here, slide nine and let\u2019s reconcile the second quarter and some of the final items. So in the second quarter we expect earnings of $0.88 to $0.90 and Op margin is about 21%. That compares to $0.88 last year.  Tax rate we expect to be about 29.5%. It was again about a 6% top line sales headwind from FX, which is about $0.06 just in the quarter versus last year. Here\u2019s a couple of other items for you as you think about your modeling. I would expect Op margin to be about 21% for the year. Top line as I mentioned before will be impacted by about $110 million versus $85 million that we talked about before and again about $0.21 of EPS pressure.  Full year CapEx, still in the $45 million. We expect free cash flow will be at that 120% that we talked about here at the end of the year and we should repurchase in the neighborhood of 2% to 3% net shares here for the year.  As I mentioned before and as we always close out, this doesn\u2019t take into account any of the impact of acquisitions and we will update you here on the second quarter call of all the impact of Novotema. There will be the classic step up charges, etcetera that we\u2019ll have and we\u2019ll net out all the impact for you as this plays on. With that, Adam I\u2019m going to stop there and let\u2019s turn it over for questions. Operator : Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Matthew McConnell with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question. Matthew McConnell : Thank you. Good morning guys. Andy Silvernail : Hey Matt. Matthew McConnell : I\u2019m hoping you can provide a little more clarity on these large project headwinds and it sounds like midstream oil and gas is still kind of holding in pretty well, but maybe correct me if I\u2019m wrong there. So is the uncertainty bleeding into other industrial markets or is this specific to upstream oil and gas or just maybe a better sense of what these large project headwinds are? Andy Silvernail : Sure, sure. So yes, you\u2019re correct Matt. The midstream has held in nicely and we expect that will for the balance of the year. The real issue is really the oil and gas side, and again that\u2019s kind of in line with our expectations. I will say that the capital freeze and we expected it to be pretty aggressive, but the capital freeze that we\u2019re seeing, in the U.S. in particular has been pretty significant, so that\u2019s one area.  The other area has been around Material Process and that\u2019s more a general industrial facing. A pretty decent amount of that is touching in the world of foods and so we have seen that hold up a little bit. We have not seen what I\u2019ll call broad based capital freeze, but whenever you see something that starts to move like this, it raises the red flag and so we are paying an awful lot of attention to it. We have all of our businesses paying a lot of attention to it.  Historically we have been able to see slowdowns coming and I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that we\u2019re there. I don\u2019t want you to get that message at all. I just want you to get the message that we\u2019ve seen a couple of places where it slowed down and we wanted to make sure that we\u2019ve got our antenna up. Matthew McConnell : Okay, great. Yes, that makes sense. I mean orders weren\u2019t even down in any of these segments, so it certainly seems like your staying in front of it. So then on profitability of Novotema, anything you can help us with there. I know you gave us the multiple on sales. Anything on EBITDA? Andy Silvernail : Yes, so it\u2019s a very profitable business. From an EBITDA margin its IDEX like. It\u2019s not going to be dilutive to our margin. As a matter of fact, it\u2019s going to be accretive overall from an EBITDA perspective. It\u2019s a very, very profitable business and the team there, we\u2019ve known this business for a long time and they\u2019ve done a great job of repositioning that business over time to be in more attractive markets and it\u2019s really a wonderful combination between PPE. So if you remember \u2013 and we bought PPE back in 2010 and there are a few things that are really unique about PPE; one of them is they have some really unique capability in Material Sciences and so as we were looking at Novotema, the question we had is kind of given Novotema\u2019s strengths in certain end markets and in manufacturing capability, could we marry their great manufacturing and some of their end markets with our Material Science capability and have the same kind of very quick turnaround for customers, whether its new product development or operationally, could we do that and the answer to that is, yes.  So we actually, before we decided to move forward with the acquisition we actually partnered with them to see if we could do this on a commercial basis. So we actually created a commercial partnership around our Material Science capability, their manufacturing capability and it really was incredibly successful and convinced both parties that this was the right marriage and so we\u2019re excited to have them as part of the family. Matthew McConnell : Great, I appreciate that in insight. Thank you. Andy Silvernail : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question. Scott Graham : Hey, good morning. Andy Silvernail : Hi Scott. Scott Graham : So in the interest of getting Heath to say something, my hope is that maybe you guys \u2013 and it\u2019s really my only question, because I thought your presentation was very clear and everything made sense. Typically you go for a certain level of productivity each year. So what do you now need incrementally to that dollar wise? Is it $10 million? Could you just size that number for us to offset the sales shortfall? Heath Mitts : Well Scott, thanks for giving my time in the sun here. We are off to a really good start from a productivity perspective this year and I think that\u2019s reflected in the margins; you see it, our ability to counteract. Going into the quarter we knew we were going to have the headwind from year-over-year from the large projects within dispensing, with our ability to more than offset that, and as well as the FX pressure is reflective in the segment operating results and we\u2019re very pleased. I wouldn\u2019t say pleasantly surprised, but we\u2019re very pleased with their performance there. We\u2019ve talked in the past about going into any given year with roughly a $25 million headwind in terms of inflation. Certainly the material inflation is something that we\u2019re able to hold down a little bit this year, in this environment, but the wage inflation is still real, which is the 60% or so of that $25 million.  So given all that, we are on track to counteract what our normal productivity both sourcing and savings, as well as OpEx type of saving around scrap and overtime reduction and the ability to lever our fixed cost base is still well on track. Now, in terms of an incremental down tick relative to when we started the year, as you know we did a fair amount of restructuring savings in the fourth quarter, where we ended up taking out about $15 million or $16 million of annualized cost. That certainly has provided some level of protection and we will consider any additional actions as necessary as we progress through the year, albeit it\u2019s going to be somewhat selective in terms of where and how we would do those things. We don\u2019t want to cut too close to the bone in any one area, because we are making strategic organic investments, and we don\u2019t want to lose out that. Scott Graham : Understood. So essentially the answer is your on track with the productivity to offset your normal inflation and the incremental this year is still in the restructuring savings, but if necessary there might be a little bit of upside to that if sales don\u2019t necessarily come through, is that a fair paraphrase? Heath Mitts : You summarized it well. Andy Silvernail : This is Andy. If you kind of dimensionalzie all this together and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve talked about it like this necessarily, but when you look at FX, you take FX, you take the impact of the large businesses that are comped from last year. Those two things together, you\u2019re talking about $35 million of profitability together that we\u2019re comping against, plus the normal $20 million to $25 million of just inflation. So you\u2019re talking like in the neighborhood of $50 million to $60 million of profit comp that we are going to cover, right, as we go through this year. So even with the guidance that we have as we sit here today, sometimes we lose sight of the magnitude of the execution that the teams have done and its damn good. Scott Graham : I appreciate it, but in continuing to answer my question Andy, I came up with another question if you don\u2019t mind. Andy Silvernail : Okay, go on. Scott Graham : It just kind of hit me you know, you were talking about the puts and takes and as you\u2019re weaving that together, how is the pricing component of things right now? Andy Silvernail : Actually it\u2019s holding up right. I would say total pricing is a little softer than we saw last year, meaning we\u2019re not getting quite as much, but your still talking about call it the 1% range that we\u2019re going to get. We\u2019ve gotten a lot of questions about are we seeing price in oil and gas and we\u2019re fortunate given kind of where we play in the food chain that we\u2019re not seeing that. I mean, in fact everybody gets the letter that says \u2018hey, we want a price reduction,\u2019 but given our proprietary positions, whether its technology or the switching costs, we\u2019re able to hold up prices pretty well. Scott Graham : Very good. Thanks guys. Andy Silvernail : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead with your question. Brian Konigsberg : Yes, thank you. Good morning. Andy Silvernail : Hey Brian. Brian Konigsberg : One of my two questions were taken, but I will go onto the question not asked, about \u2013 so just on FX, can you just talk about how that maybe impacting you from a competitive standpoint? Is it becoming more difficult to compete against some of the European employers, particularly maybe in HST or maybe if there is other areas in a portfolio that might have that type of dynamic going on. Andy Silvernail : So there are puts and takes relative to that competitively. So we\u2019re pretty fortunate that the vast majority of what we do, kind of where we manufacture and where we compete typically and so we don\u2019t necessarily see that kind of competition, although you certainly will see some overseas competition in kind of European competitors trying to go after to the U.S. market where we have a strong foothold, and I\u2019m just using it as an example, so you will see some of that.  But this is again, I\u2019ve kind of used the term, \u2018these markets are glacial\u2019 and for good and for ill, the markets moved really slowly and so I think the question that your asking is more of a, if we stay in this sustained area for a few years, will we start to see it on new business that\u2019s playing through, right. So much of our business is going into an aftermarket or a like for like replacement versus kind of large contracts that are going out, and so it would take years to kind of play through from a competitive standpoint, so that\u2019s kind of one thing, so we\u2019re not seeing it today. The other part is, remember, we\u2019ve got a pretty decent footprint in other parts of the world. 50% of our business is non-U.S. and 40% of it is actually produced outside of the U.S. So while we may see some things in a few years if the current currencies play themselves out, we also have the benefits of being more competitive in the businesses that we have outside of the U.S. So I don\u2019t expect it\u2019s going to be a big impact that we\u2019ll see. Brian Konigsberg : Great, and let me just follow-on. On the water business, clearly your doing very well gaining share, bringing new products to market. The underlying market itself, are you starting to see things starting to firm up. We know a number of projects have been delayed over the last couple of years. Are those starting to break loose or is really your success here just a matter of market share gains. Andy Silvernail : I would say we are seeing the improvement. I would say that the number of municipal bids that are going out and in particular, the number of large dollar bids that I think people were really hesitant on, in North America in particular have improved. And so if you recall, we made a real conscious decision to reposition ourselves relative to the markets that we were going after in new water services in the U.S. and in the UK and that was the right move in terms of focus and going after the right profit pools then and I think it\u2019s going to pay dividends for us as those places start to free up a little more capital. So the businesses are better in the U.S. and in Europe or I should say the UK. I should say in North America, in the UK and also in China we\u2019ve seen that a little bit. So we\u2019ve seen some level of improvement in China. Brian Konigsberg : That\u2019s excellent. Thank you. Andy Silvernail : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo Advisors. Please go ahead with your question. Allison Poliniak : Hi guys, good morning. Andy Silvernail : Hi Allison. Allison Poliniak : Hi. Just Andy on the organic investment side, obviously your use of cash, can we maybe talk about how you\u2019re looking at it and maybe I guess there would be some certain environment. I know some of your markets and harder to move, but is there a share gain opportunity for you? Are you becoming more selective because of certain end markets at this point? Andy Silvernail : Yes. You have to think about organic investments at IDEX in a multiyear phase or thought process and the reason I say that is, if you think about generally any business that we have, from the time of concept through I\u2019ll call it, full demand, you\u2019re talking about a five year timeframe, if you\u2019re realistic about it.  And so the things that we\u2019re winning on now, if you go back to 2012 when we talked about making some major choices and cutting abilities in 2012, the benefits that we\u2019re seeing today with those investments with them and I know sometimes for the investment community that can be unfulfilling, because you don\u2019t get the rapid speed that you get, so that\u2019s also why the markets are so darn defensible.  So the investments that we\u2019re making today, in reality they are not going to show up for two, three, four, five years in full, but we know that we\u2019ve got to have the patience and the discipline to play that out. The diversified space in general gets a lot of criticism around organic growth and I\u2019ve been asked many times kind of what\u2019s underneath that and my belief is frankly we don\u2019t have the discipline and the patience to make the multiyear investments and you just you have to do it and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. Allison Poliniak : That\u2019s great. And then last call you talked a little bit about energy and maybe potential benefit as we move to the end of \u201915 in to \u201916 from the sort of energy tax really we\u2019re getting here. Any thoughts of that, updates, changes if you can let me know? Andy Silvernail : It\u2019s not playing itself through yet, except maybe the one place that we\u2019re seeing it is actually in Dispensing and the reason I\u2019d say that is demand that\u2019s going through the retailers, which is putting more money in their pockets and so if you look at the Dispensing business, it really on a global basis, that\u2019s been pretty good, right. So if you look at the overall business there as capital is flowing through those retailers and allows them to refurbish, it is allowing for that to flow through dispending to some degree. It\u2019s hard to peg it exactly Allison, but I would say that\u2019s one place that you could draw a line to.  How it plays through the general economy that was my statement at the fourth quarter call. Typically that can be a year or more before it goes through the consumer into the business community. So I still think we are going to live with that gap where you\u2019ve seen massive capital cuts in the energy world and therefore now we\u2019re seeing the daily layoffs that are happening in those places. You\u2019re going to see that be the near term impact and then maybe at the end of this year; in \u201916 you\u2019ll see how that flows through back to the business community. Allison Poliniak : Perfect, thanks guys. Andy Silvernail : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Radigan with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question. Joe Radigan : Thanks, good morning guys. Andy Silvernail : Good morning Joe. Joe Radigan : I guess first, what percentage of MPT is driven by project activity and then maybe the same question for the energy piece of FMT? Andy Silvernail : So for MPT its going to be in that, call it 40% range plus or minus; that has a larger capital piece to it, and when I say larger capital that\u2019s dimensionalized there. You\u2019re talking about $250,000 to sometimes a several million dollar project, but those are pretty rare. So when we say large capital, we are not talking about $50 million projects or anything like that. But you can see it\u2019s certainly in a quarter or two that are dry or robust. You can see how that\u2019s going to play itself through, really for the balance of the year. So the order softness that we saw here in the first quarter, that\u2019s going to play itself through as we get to the third and the fourth quarter in particular.  The second quarter is actually okay in terms of what we can see in the funnel. So that\u2019s a little bit more lumpy than we\u2019re using to seeing within IDEX, but that\u2019s the kind of the dimensions we\u2019re talking about. We don\u2019t have the same magnitude in the energy side. Joe Radigan : Okay, and then just to be clear, have you seen any orders that were already in backlog get cancelled or is this more restricted to kind of the go forward order rates? Andy Silvernail : It\u2019s really around go forward. Again, generally we don\u2019t have a lot of exposure to kind of big capital stuff that\u2019s in the pipeline that we have committed and we have an order getting canceled. Its more when we see a large capital project, let\u2019s just say in energy, we have some business that may go into it, let\u2019s call it in that $250,000 to $1 million range, but more of it is understanding kind of how that pipeline is going to flow to what we call our book and term business, and so you\u2019ll see BAND-IT as an example, when you know a large capital projects happening, we know we\u2019re going to get a large chunk of the business, but it\u2019s not committed until kind of really late in the process. So we don\u2019t have a lot of things sitting on our books today that are at risk of being canceled. Its more kind of an understanding of what that pipeline\u2019s going to look like here over the next six to 12 months. Joe Radigan : Okay. And then I guess my next question actually is around BAND-IT and I think Andy you\u2019ve talked about that being sort of a dull weather for the overall economy since it touches so many end markets and a short cycle. If you exclude the oil and gas piece of it, which is understandable, have you seen any trends kind of in that base run rate business that either give you cost for concern or vice versa reason for encouragement? Andy Silvernail : That\u2019s a great question, because as we were looking at their order rates and as we go through our typical business reviews, we asked kind of that same question. So we actually asked them to look specifically at \u2013 we have an energy vertical within BAND-IT, so we can kind of see that piece.  But then we saw some weakness that we were like, wait a second here, what\u2019s going on? So we asked them to kind of dice up the country and look at it and lo and behold, all of the weakness that they found happened to be in the four states that have enormous energy exposure. So really isolated to energy, the normal kind of general distribution, book and term business, transportation business is quite good. Joe Radigan : Okay, and then maybe one more question on HST. How should we think about the organic growth for the balance of the year? You have a relatively easy comp in the second quarter, but then you\u2019re facing plus mid single digits in the back half. Book-to-bill is good, but orders are only up organically 2%. So how are you thinking about that trajectory in HST? Andy Silvernail : I think we\u2019re going to be looking at kind of 3% to 4% organically, but let me kind of parse that a little, because I think that\u2019s important. I think what you\u2019ll see are meaningfully stronger numbers in Scientific Fluidics. I think you\u2019ll see the strength there in optics and you\u2019ll see the weakness that we just talked about a moment ago and MPT is a place through the third and the fourth quarter.  So as you think about kind of the core markets that we really spend a lot of time on and we put a lot of our core investment in, we think that\u2019s going to be actually pretty decent here as we move through the year. Joe Radigan : Great. Thanks a lot Andy. Andy Silvernail : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Douglass with Longbow Research. Please go ahead with your question. Mark Douglass : Hi, good morning gentlemen. Andy Silvernail : Hi Mark. Mark Douglass : That leaves me into looking at FSD. The dispensing order comp and ONG was talking about 2015. The dispensing order comp is about $20 million in 1Q \u201914, is that about right? Andy Silvernail : You\u2019re talking sales, the sales number? Mark Douglass : Yes, sales number. Andy Silvernail : Yes, it was more like $24 million. It is a big number. Mark Douglass : Okay, I get that, because initially I think some of it you thought would roll in to second quarter. Andy Silvernail : Yes, if you recall the first quarter last year we ended up have having a really strong first quarter, principally because we did pull \u2013 our customer assets to pull it forward into the first quarter. Heath Mitts : Hey Mark, this is Heath. Just to clarify though, what we talked about earlier in the year. It was about a $50 million worth of big projects. That\u2019s made up for two specific dispensing orders and one in the fire suppression space. So in the first quarter it was about half of that $50 million, in the second quarter it\u2019s the blended of the other two. So in total dispensing is about $35 million made up of two projects and then there\u2019s about $15 million out of the fire suppression space, and so we\u2019ll still have about a $20 million to $25 million headwind in Q2. Mark Douglass : Right. 3Q was pretty strong too. Andy Silvernail : It was but we\u2019ve talked about it in the prior year and within our guidance is really the Q1, Q2 impact in the headwinds. We did have a good Q3 of last year, but it wasn\u2019t so much tied to very specific project activity. Mark Douglass : Okay, that was broader. Okay, so then my question then you\u2019re looking at \u201915, I mean we\u2019re probably talking mid-single digit decline organically. Heath Mitts : Yes, low to mid, yes. Mark Douglass : A low to mid decline. Okay, in FMT I believe you said you were thinking low to mid single digit growth. Are we closer to flat to low single digits? Heath Mitts : You are still talking up kind of 2 to 3. Mark Douglass : 2 to 3. Heath Mitts : Yes. Mark Douglass : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Andy Silvernail : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Maczka from BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question. Kevin Maczka : Thanks, good morning. Andy Silvernail : Good morning Kevin. Kevin Maczka : Andy I just wanted to piggyback on the organic growth question, and I appreciate your commentary of the fact that you have to take a long term view and make investments now that want pay dividends for a few years, but can you just touch on why is that such a long cycle, why is it five years? Is it because in some cases you are almost inventing new markets and you have to prove to customers that they need that type of product or is it that you are trying to displace an entrenched competitor and maybe that\u2019s not an easy thing to do. Andy Silvernail : Yes. So if we kind of break but, but let\u2019s just use five years as, five years is when you at, I\u2019ll call it kind of full volume so to speak. So you are talking a year or two of that is going to be product development. That\u2019s really where you going from idea to having a product that you are able to launch into the market place.  The industrial customers generally, and unless its \u2013 if it\u2019s just a basic revision of product, that\u2019s a different story. But when you are talking a new product, these customers are very, very cautious and so you generally have a testing that\u2019s going to happen, and let\u2019s just call that a year plus or minus that you are going to see, where people are really testing the solution, and then you have the issue of just opportunity for uptake and let me just give you an example of that.  You take a normal process facility and this is just kind of the way to think of it. Unless it\u2019s a new facility, they generally only have wash-up somewhere between two or four weeks a year, so kind of maintenance shutdown. And so the opportunity for really brining in a product into an existing facility is they are relatively small windows. So you are then really relying on some kind of refurb within a facility or you are looking at new facilities coming in online.  So when you blend that all in, that\u2019s why that timeframe is as long as it is. And again, I said this before, while it certainly leads to some frustration around your ability to change the organic growth curve quickly, it\u2019s also the beauty of the defensibility of businesses like IDEX. Kevin Maczka : Got it, that\u2019s helpful and then in FSB, you\u2019re calling the X mark product the Juggernaut now. Andy Silvernail : It\u2019s been great. Kevin Maczka : I don\u2019t think there is too many individual huge needle movers within the IDEX portfolio. But can you just talk \u2013 to the extent you can talk about anything coming, that we ought to be keeping an out for, is there something that you\u2019re particularly excited about here for the next couple of years. Andy Silvernail : That\u2019s a relatively unusual example for us. And to give you a sense of it, that\u2019s going to be a $20 million product for us, when it\u2019s all said and done, but it has taken three or four years. I would put eDRAULIC into that same kind of category.  In both those cases what you saw for was really a gap in the market. And so with X mark in particular what you have now is you have, an automatic dispenser that is really displacing an entire segment of the market that was manual dispensers. Right so you got to the kind of price point that was attractive, specifically in the emerging markets, that very much wanted that the quality and the capability of an automatic dispenser, but they were never going to reach that price point that the western world could, where there is enormous volume and it makes sense to have that kind of product, so we really solved that. We\u2019ve got a couple at Viking that are going to be in that $10 million range. One that actually will be in that $10 million range this year and a couple of others that come into the pipeline, they look that way. We\u2019ve got certainly within Scientific Fluidics. We have brought together \u2013 actually the combination of Scientific Fluidics in optics. That promise of the idea of the optical fluidic engine. We\u2019ve have seen some promise in there the marrying of fluidics and optics that has reset kind of a level, that $10 million to $20 million level. But for the most part you are really talking about $5 million to $10 million chunks that we look at. Kevin Maczka : Got it, thanks again. Andy Silvernail : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen Group Inc. Please go ahead with your question. Joe Giordano : Hi guys, thanks for talking my question. Just wanted to touch on HST a bit here. So you are growing mid-single digits back half of last year, now flat organic. Am I right in thinking that that\u2019s almost entirely from MPT? Like has been a second derivative decline in fluidics or anything like that. Andy Silvernail : No, it\u2019s all MPT related. Joe Giordano : Okay and then quickly on muni, can you maybe parse out the environments on break and fix versus cap run. I know you touched on it earlier with some of the larger products and maybe U.S. versus Europe in those kind of splits. Andy Silvernail : So the break fix business has been the stronger part. We did see a couple of things break our way in the U.S. here and over the last couple of quarters we saw it kind of couple of big new installations or new projects rather in the U.S. I should say North American because we have one that was meaningful in Canada.  And then the UK, the amp cycles that you see over there, we have one, so it\u2019s major pieces of that that showed up in our order rates, and that will be a nice piece of business for us here over the next couple of years. Joe Giordano : Great. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Matt McConnell at RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your follow-up. Matt McConnell : Thanks guys. I just wanted to touch on Ag real quick. Based on its size and I guess the aftermarket content, I\u2019m surprised that even had the capacity to drive a measurable change to the guidance. So are there any inventory adjustments in the channel or are you seeing after markets slowdown a lot more than you had expected. I would imagine that\u2019s usually fairly steady, but just maybe size the aftermarket content and whether that\u2019s also participating in this weakness. Andy Silvernail : Sure, sure. Well, the first thing to keep in mind is this is a very high contribution margin business. So certainly as you look on the continuum of IDEX, this is on the far side from the overall contribution margin. And so a small top line hit, it is meaningful on a bottom line and just because it is at the level it is, and there just isn\u2019t a cost structure to rip out so to speak, nor would you want to in a business like that that you believe long term in there.  So relative to the demand side Matt, the OEM side is sharper than we would have expected and I will say that in the Ag distribution channel there is a lot of inventory, there is no doubt about it and so that\u2019s going to play itself through. In terms of the aftermarket, meaning again kind of the break fix stuff, that\u2019s going to hold up well, right, because at the end of the day if you are running a sprayer as an example, you got to do the maintenance on it this year and typical what we see happen in the cycles like this is people aren\u2019t buying new equipment and so they are not retiring the old equipment. But they are retiring the old equipment and what you see now is the older equipment having a little bit longer life cycle.  And so that would be better, but the amount of new product in the channels and what\u2019s happening in the OEMs in terms of their product schedules, that\u2019s pretty significant. And farm prices or farm profits have been hit, and you guys all know the story here better than anybody. The farm profits have been hit meaningful and that\u2019s going to take at least this year to play through and will kind of judge the impact on next year. Matt McConnell : Okay, great. Thanks very much. That helps. Andy Silvernail : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have no further question at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing remarks. Andy Silvernail : Well, thank you Adam and again, we appreciate your interest in IDEX and the ability to walk you through here, what\u2019s going on. Obviously we are very proud of the execution that we have been able to do here in the first quarter, but we recognize the realities of the world, and so that idea of controlling your own destiny is some thinking that we put front and center and we are absolutely going to do so.  We always keep in mind the long term value creation for shareholders and our desire to be one of the superior creators of value and we are going to continue to work for you. And so, we appreciate your support and we will talk to you hear in 90 days. Thank you. Take care. Operator : Thank you again ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude our teleconference for today. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

With that, I'll turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Andy Silvernail. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everybody, and I appreciate you being here for \u2013 to discuss our second quarter call. As we sit and look at the global economy and really, the end markets, that's the story for 2015. It has been the story, and it will be the story for the balance of the year. When we closed the first quarter, we talked an awful lot about what was going on with the strength of the dollar, the decline in oil and gas, and some challenging overall conditions. And in the second quarter, that certainly continued. Ag has weighed on on our overall results along with oil and gas. And in the early part of the second quarter, we saw some slowing in the North American industrial side, specifically in distribution. But on the other hand, we had pretty strong results coming out of Scientific Fluidics and our Sealing businesses within Health & Science. So the markets and the regions are what I would call a mixed bag right now, but our teams are executing very well. We had really nice performance in operating margins, EPS, and cash flow. And additionally, we closed three acquisitions in the last 60 days and retired some European debt that had matured in June. So for the second quarter, we had EPS of $0.89. It was $0.01 over last year. Cash flow was strong at $86 million or 124% of net income. Operating margin was an impressive 21.3%, up 80 basis points from last year. Organic sales and operating margins in HST were up 4% and 280 basis points, respectively. Very, very nice job by the teams. We also had a 170-basis point increase in Fire & Safety/Diversified in the op margin, and we (3:58-3:59) acquisitions of Novotema, Alfa Valvole, and CiDRA for just about $200 million. And then finally, as I mentioned, we did retire \u20ac81 million of European private placement debt that had matured in June. So, the way I'd sum it up is a tough overall market with really outstanding execution by our teams in controlling our own destiny. As we look at the rest of this year as the second half of 2015, I think we're going to see more of the same. With that, we have made the decision to continue to simplify our operating structure, and we are going to do some restructuring here in the back half of the year. We'll spend somewhere around $8 million or so, and that payback will generally be less than a year. So we should have nice benefit for that as we exit this year and enter into 2016. And I would say we have had a little bit of momentum here, positive momentum in the back part of June and in the early part of July. The industrial businesses that had slowed down, we did see a tick up in the back half of June and the first couple weeks of July. So overall, I'm confident that we can deliver in the back half for our customers and certainly for you, our shareholders. And we're going to hold our EPS guidance at $3.50 to $3.60 for the year. And in just a few minutes, I'll take some time and then talk about the results and our expectations for the year, but did want to take a moment and just talk about the appointment of Eric Ashleman to Chief Operating Officer, the announcement that we had last week. I think that this is an important inflection point for IDEX. For the past four years, we've invested very heavily in what I would call the foundational elements of the company. The vision, strategy, our capital deployment philosophy, culture teams, and importantly, the IDEX operating model, and this is absolutely the right thing to do and the right time to do it. And we've driven outstanding performance for our shareholders, we've built our internal capabilities, and we've really put the foundation in place for accelerated growth. And I think that that foundation is very sturdy, and we're preparing ourselves for a new phase of growth. Eric and I have worked together closely since when I joined the business here in January of 2009. He's proven to be really, an outstanding executive, he's delivered great performance, he's built strong teams, and he's led virtually all of our organic initiatives, including our efforts around diversity and inclusion. And he'll do a great job continuing to strengthen the foundation of IDEX and driving overall performance. Importantly, Eric's promotion allows me to invest more time in the key areas of growth for the company, whether it's globalization, larger organic investments, or acquisitions, I'm going to have more time. And historically, these elements have been a very important component to the IDEX success story. We've been a public company now for 27 years. And in those 27 years, we've had compound top line growth of over 11% per year. That's a pretty high bar that's been set by my predecessors, and if we're going to achieve that kind of performance, if we're going to step up to those kind of expectations, I need to put more time into the faster pieces of growth for the business, and this organizational change will really give me the capacity to do that. So I'm excited to work with Eric as a partner on the operating side of the business, and really prepare ourselves for the next phase of growth. And I want to congratulate Eric, once again, for his appointment. With that, let me pivot over and talk about what we're seeing around the world. So, in North America, as we talked about before, energy and Ag, they continue to be pretty challenging, and I don't expect any change in 2015. The distribution businesses had slowed in the first part of the quarter. The book-and-term business had been relatively soft. And we did, as we mentioned before, see an uptick in the back half of June into July in North America. In Europe, Europe's been a good story for us, or at least on a relative basis compared to our expectations coming into the year. The business has been stronger than we anticipated, particularly in Water, Rescue, and Dispensing. And we have actually seen some upside in some larger project business on the energy side in Western Europe in particular, and a little bit in the Middle East. That is offset by the weakness that we're seeing in Eastern Europe and in Russia with the turmoil in that region. China continues to be soft. If I look at the broader Asia-Pacific area, that's actually been decent for us, but China in particular, continues to be a little bit of a challenge. And although we have seen a pick-up, a little bit of a pick-up on the municipal side of the business in China, we remain cautious just with, kind of everything that's going on in that region. Let me take a few minutes now and talk about capital deployment. I think this is a great story here in 2015 and obviously, it's going to be a big piece of our story going forward. So, we've laid out four strategies for capital deployment that we've talked about over and over again. And those are fully funding organic growth, paying a consistent dividend, smart share repurchases, and strategic M&A. And I'll touch on each of those here for just a moment. On the organic growth side, even though markets in the global economy are a challenge for us, we're going to continue to invest. And we're going to invest $45 million in capital spending. That continues to be at record levels for us. We're going to invest in people. We're going to invest in channels. We're going to invest in technology and new products, and we have consistently done that. And I know it will pay dividends for us. It has consistently in the past, and I'm certain it will as we move forward. In the second quarter, we also had a $0.32 per share dividend. We repurchased 661,000 shares for about $51 million, and we believe we'll have about a 2% net reduction in our share base for the year. On the M&A side, over the last 60 days, we've put $200 million to work in in three different acquisitions, and they fit into three different businesses within IDEX, which makes integration substantially more simple. We had Novotema that we talked about last quarter, that will be a part of our Ceiling Group. Alfa Valvole is a manufacturer of specialty valves that will fit right into FMT nicely. And then, CiDRA Precision Services, they design and product microfluidic components, which is a really important strategic piece of the puzzle for our Scientific Fluidics business, and they're going to be wonderful addition. And really, all three businesses, we're thrilled to have them as part of IDEX and welcome them into really, a great company. If you look at our funnel, as we look forward, our funnel continues to be solid for M&A, and through the back half of this year as we look into 2016, and certainly, our goal of continuing to intelligently deploy our capital in acquisitions that fit our strategy is very much intact. All right. With that, let's go over to the results. I'm on Slide four. So orders for the quarter were $505 million. That was down 8% in total, down 4% organically. And we had revenues of $515 million, which was down 6%, down 2% organically. And what I would say there is, that's a very typical second quarter for us, so that book-to-bill of 0.98 so to speak is \u2013 that's a pretty normal flow of business for us. So certainly, not a concern that we brought down $10 million of backlog. That's very typical. As I mentioned before, operating margin, very strong at 21.3%, up 80 basis points. And, as I think about sales and orders, it's pretty much what we expected. A little bit weaker in energy and Ag in the U.S., a little stronger in Europe. So net-net, we are performing where we thought we would, with a little bit better operating performance or execution performance at the bottom line. Free cash flow, as I mentioned, was $86 million. We converted at 124% of net income. And EPS was $0.89, up $0.01 from last year. Okay. Let's move on to the segment discussions, I'm on Slide five, and we'll start with Fluid & Metering. So FMT closed out the quarter, they had 3% decrease in organic orders, 2% down organic sales. End market conditions are what I talked about for the most part there, really unchanged from last quarter. The industrial side, as I mentioned before, we saw some slippage in the early part of the quarter, seeing some pickup here in the latter part into July, mostly around distribution, and what we thought \u2013 what we think we saw early in the quarter with some destocking. It's not a huge number, but the flow of orders certainly was, it was a little bit atypical early in the quarter, and we saw it catch up here. And we did, of course, add Alfa Valvole into our severe duty valve products, and that's a nice combination with Richter and with Aegis as part of that overall portfolio. Water services has been a very good story here this year. Demand in the U.S. and the UK has been solid with municipal spending up, and we've also seen really nice wins from new products in that areas and excellent execution, and we have confidence in a nice second half there. Energy, we've talked about this, with the slowdown. We have seen some slowdown in our mobile area which is around trucks, so \u2013 which is \u2013 in the midstream. That did slow down a little bit in the second quarter. That was offset with strength in transportation. And we saw some surprising strength in Western Europe and the Middle East in energy, but certainly, as we look across the world, we still could see that as a challenge here for the balance of the year. And Ag, we've talked about, farm incomes down substantially. We know what the inventory looks like in the channels, and so, we know we're going to continue to have some challenges here in the back half of the year and into the first part of 2016. But that's just a great business that we're going to continue to invest in, and \u2013 it has been and will continue to be a winner for us long-term. And, let's turn to Slide six here, and go on to Health & Science. Organic orders were down 4% while our organic sales were up 4%. And we had, as I mentioned before, just really outstanding margin performance, up 280 basis points, very, very good mix, and in even better productivity gains in those businesses. If you look at Scientific Fluidics, it's really firing on all cylinders \u2013 Analytical Instrumentation, the bio world, in vitro diagnostics, all of them had good demand for the second quarter in a row. The teams have done a terrific job with execution and new product development. So we see tailwinds in the back half of the year, and of course, the addition of CiDRA into that business, and building a microfluidics vertical for them is going to be an important part to their overall strategy. If you look at Sealing, Sealing was strong also in the U.S. and in Europe, driven really by performance in the semiconductor market. It was offset a little bit by oil and gas and heavy equipment, but net-net, had a strong second quarter. And of course, we closed the Novotema acquisition, which is a terrific combination with our PPE business out in the UK. Optics & Photonics remained stable in the quarter. End markets are holding steady with strength in life sciences, and the profitability improvement there has been impressive, and really, has come to the point where it's a terrific profit producer for the company. HST in industrial, so as you know, we have some businesses in this segment that are industrial-facing. Those had dynamics that look more like FMT, so weakness early in the quarter, improvement towards the end of the quarter. And I think just overall, great profit performance in those businesses, great use of capital. And it's really about the back half of the year trying to grow those businesses at a faster rate than the overall economy. And then finally, Material Process Technologies, as you know, that's a little bit more lumpy for us. It had a good quarter, had good organic sales performance, but we can see the pipeline of orders, and so we know that the second half is going to be a little bit more of a challenge for us. But they'll continue to execute well. All right. I'm on our last segment, Diversified. I'm on Slide 7. Organic orders were down 7%, organic sales were down 11%. And as you know, the second quarter is really where we had the last and the large projects from last year, so as you move into the latter half of the year, the comps become a little bit more normalized. But certainly, in the second quarter, we had that, with both trailers and the large Dispensing orders that we had in 2014. Impressively, margins, even with that kind of top line performance, margins were up 170 basis points from really, outstanding productivity gains and favorable product mix. As you know, of our segments, Diversified is the one that can have the most product mix, whether it's in businesses or across businesses within a segment, and we certainly saw that in the second quarter. Dispensing is growing in all geographies. They had a tough sales comp. If you back out the large projects, they had, which made for tough comps. On the base business, they continue to grow across the board. Now Western Europe has been solid for us, Eastern Europe softer, again due to the issues with instability in the region. But we saw Asia very strong. X-Smart continues to be a strong product release for us. And the U.S. continues to be solid. In Fire, the North American and the UK pump business are \u2013 really have no indications of softness. We've seen strength through the first half of the year, and expect it to be good in the second half. Now, we do have the \u2013 if you remember last year, we had a strong business in trailers, nuclear trailers going into the nuclear industry last year. We are annualizing that. That bubble, so to speak, has moved through. It's still a nice business for us, but it's going to be a little bit smaller chunk of business going forward as we expected it would be. Rescue, like Dispensing, we've seen nice momentum in Western Europe, and \u2013 but we have seen weakness in China and real strength in the U.S. Our eDRAULIC products have been very strong in the U.S. in particular, and so we continue to ride that strong new product. And finally, BAND-IT, BAND-IT has consistently been a great company for IDEX. They have been hit by the impact of oil and gas, but they had real strength in transportation, so it's kind of a mixed bag at BAND-IT. But again, like Ag, a business that's been a real workhorse for us and will continue to be as we go forward. All right, with that, I'm on our last slide, Slide 8, and let me give you some color here on what we think is going to happen in the third quarter, and some guidance for the balance of the year. In Q3, EPS we expect to be $0.88 to $0.90. Operating margin of just around 21%. We think our tax rate will be 29% to 29.5% and we're going to have about a 5% headwind in FX for the third quarter, and that's about 5% of EPS in the third quarter versus \u2013 excuse me, $0.05 of EPS for a headwind versus last year. We are again, reiterating our guidance for the full year. We're going to hold it at $3.50 to $3.60. We expect organic revenue to be flat. That's modestly down from our last expectation, and we think that overall operating margin will be just about 21%. Here are a few other items for you for the full year. Total top line impact from FX will be about $95 million. That compares to about $110 million that we talked about last quarter, and all up, that's about a $0.20 headwind to EPS for the full year. Full year CapEx, as I mentioned earlier, will be about $45 million, free cash flow should be about 120% of net income, and we think share repurchases will be just about net 2% of our share base for the year, so we'll reduce it by 2% for the year. Finally, as always, our earnings and our guidance did not include the future of potential acquisitions or the costs associated with acquisitions, or the cost of the restructuring that I mentioned earlier. With that, operator, I'm going to stop here and open it up to questions. Unknown Speaker : Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Nathan Jones from Stifel. Nathan H. Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Morning, Nathan. Nathan H. Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I'd just like to start \u2013 we're trying to get a better handle on those margins in FSD. I remember last year as the Dispensing order was going through, we were talking about how you don't expect these kind of margins. This is a 25% margin business. You talk about mix in there, but I would have thought that the mix might have actually been negative, given BAND-IT is probably the highest margin business in there. Might be a bit challenged, and yet, we're throwing up 28% margins in that segment. So if you could just help me understand how we're getting a 28% margin. Have we reset kind of the expectation here, or is this more of a one-off? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: I think this has been \u2013 this was an extraordinary quarter from a profitability standpoint. And the mix certainly did help us substantially. So, you got a few things that are happening here around mix. So the Trailer business from last year, which was a big chunk of revenue, was at a relatively low margin on a comparative basis. And so, so that not being part of it, Nathan, is certainly a piece of the story there. You've got Fire that's in there that really, that's a business. You go back to time, right? You go back in time and that's a business that was a low-teens op margin business, and it's now kind of a low 20%s, mid-20%s op margin business. So from that perspective, you have had a little bit of a reset there. And even within businesses, so if you go within BAND-IT, as an example, the products that were softer within BAND-IT for the quarter were the lower margin products, and the products that were stronger were higher margin. Same story within Rescue. So, it was both across businesses and within businesses that we had a pretty unusual product mix in the quarter. So, while I do think there is a modest reset, meaning higher overall margins for FSD, this really was a pretty unusual mix quarter. So, if we're looking at a 26% or so next quarter or so, wouldn't surprise me. But I don't think we're going to be at this level. That would be too ambitious. Nathan H. Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. So how much of the mix do you think is just, I guess luck (23:21) kind of stuff versus the markets that we might be entrenched in for a longer period of time like \u2013 is it a BAND-IT selling into oil and gas, these lower margins so you would expect that kind of mix to continue and stuff like that? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yeah. Again, it's \u2013 we don't \u2013 mix, typically is not a big piece of the overall IDEX story, but I do think that what we experienced here in the quarter was pretty unusual within Dispensing so \u2013 excuse me, within Diversified. So it's going to move around, Nathan, it's going to move around more than the rest of the company. Again, I would not take this as the new bar for Diversified. Nathan H. Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Fair enough. And then, if we could just go back to the North American industrial, particularly the stuff through distribution, I think a lot of companies are talking about fairly significant destocking that they saw in the second quarter. It sounds like you saw some, but maybe it was a little bit. You talked about second half of June getting better into July getting better. Did we dip down and come back to where we were before, or did we dip down and come halfway back, or dip down and go above where we were before? Just a little color on what you're seeing in the \u2013 for actual end market demand, if we could kind of X down destocking. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yeah. So what I would say is what we saw \u2013 we definitely saw a slowdown in April, right? So we saw a slowdown in April. May was a sharp drop, and I'm really talking about FMT here. It was a pretty sharp drop coming out of distribution. And then, June as a total snapped back above the April levels, and I'm talking about orders here, snapped back above the April levels, really driven by the last two weeks, three weeks of that month. And then, July has kind of evened off to be consistent with where we thought it would be. So what I would say is, the level that we're running at now is more consistent with our total outlook, where May was where we saw significant destocking happen, and I'd say we're kind of back at run rates now. Nathan H. Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks a lot. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yep. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Radigan from KeyBanc. Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, guys. Andy, on the slowdown in industrial North America, maybe outside of the distribution business, have you seen anything that would suggest maybe more broad base than some of the businesses that have second-derivative energy or close energy exposure? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yeah. To some degree. So if you remember from the first quarter, we called out that we had seen CapEx generally come down versus our expectations. And \u2013 but what had happened in the first quarter is we saw the \u2013 about the larger stuff that we don't do a lot of, but we do some of it, had \u2013 we certainly saw a slowdown. But the book-and-term business had held up really nicely. The difference in the second quarter was that we really saw that book-and-term business slow down in April and May. That was the difference in comeback. I do think that overall, the industrial \u2013 industrial America is weaker today than it certainly was six months, nine months, 12 months ago, and I'm really talking about from an overall growth perspective. And I think certainly, oil and gas, the reverberations from oil and gas is touching the other industries, how our CapEx touches other industries. The thing that hasn't happened yet \u2013 if you remember, we talked about this at the yearend call, and we also talked about it at the first quarter call, it can take easily a year for the spending that gets driven by \u2013 into other parts of the economy to feed itself back through, so we knew there would be a lull. We knew there would be a lull, and if you expect \u2013 depending upon what your view is whether or not overall spending is going to make its way back to the industrial economy is kind of how you think about growth, I think starting in 2016. So I think the rate \u2013 the levels that we're at now, we should expect through the back end of the year. I don't see a stimulant in particular, on the upside. And so, I think we're running them \u2013 we're managing the business based on the kind of demand patterns we're seeing right now. Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then on the third quarter guidance, what sort of organic growth do you expect? I don't think you gave that. If you did, I apologize. Is it \u2013 I mean, you have a tough comp there. I think it was plus 8% a year ago, so do you expect another organic decline in the third quarter and then a rebound in the fourth quarter to get you flat for the year, or how do you see that trajectory playing out? Heath A. Mitts - IDEX Corp.: Yeah. Hey Joe, this is Heath. We did not guide it, but we would expect it to come in kind of flattish organic. Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Heath. And then maybe lastly, on naming Eric COO, does that change at all your willingness or your ability to look at maybe a larger acquisition or maybe your comfort level about doing a more complex integration or more of a fixer-upper than what IDEX typically has, or is this more just to free you up to do more strategic-type things? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: I don't think philosophically, it changes our approach to M&A. We've always looked at a combination of bigger and smaller things. But something big has got to just make \u2013 it's got to be a slam dunk from a strategic and a financial perspective to risk the quality of a business that we have today. And so, we've always looked at those things, but almost always with a pretty skeptical eye generally. So I don't think it philosophically changes our approach to M&A. It does liberate me personally from a time perspective. Eric and I, we've been working together since Day One when I joined the company. We've got a great rhythm together. He's a terrific operator. And it absolutely gives me more capacity from an M&A perspective. And when we contemplated doing this, kind of in line with our annual strategic planning process, it was all about our confidence level in the quality of our business today and the foundation that we have, and the fact that we think we're ready to accelerate growth. Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks, Andy. Thanks, Heath. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yep. Take care, Joe. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Konigsberg from Vertical Research Partners. Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Yes. Hi. Good morning. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Hi. Good morning. Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Maybe just hitting a little bit more on FMT and the commentary around energy. So, North America, you saw a little bit of that weakness start creeping in, but you're still seeing pretty solid Europe and Middle East. Maybe you could comment what type of projects are those and the confidence that those could remain on track and within the funnel. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: So I would say the surprise for us was really around some larger skid projects that we've seen in the Middle East coming out of some businesses that we have in the combination of Germany and Italy. And so \u2013 don't get me wrong, they have not been huge projects, but there has been a dearth of projects in that region here for \u2013 gosh, I don't want to say, 18 months now. And so, seeing that pick back up \u2013 and the team had expected that to pick back up in the back part of this year. So I don't want to overplay that. I don't think it's some giant rebound, but it was good news generally, and so we feel pretty good about that. On the U.S. side, the thing that was softer is the truck builds, from a mobile perspective, have been pretty strong, and we have definitely benefited from that in the midstream. And we expect that to get softer \u2013 certainly as you go into 2016, all indicators are that the truck build is probably going to be negative next year, and so that piece of the business will get hit negatively. We expect that to happen. However, on the aerospace side of it, or the aviation side of it, rather, we expect that to be pretty strong. Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Yeah, and maybe just comment a little bit on pricing. Maybe both in the energy and I guess more broadly \u2013 you, traditionally, have been able to maintain a fairly positive spread. Is there any changes to that outlook, or you able to maintain the position you've had recently? Heath A. Mitts - IDEX Corp.: This is Heath. We \u2013 our position going into the year has held true to this point, which is about, on a gross basis, about positive 1 point of price. We don't break that down by individual platforms within the business, externally anyway, but we've been pleased with our progress on price in terms of holding that to this point in the year. And we would expect to hold it through the remainder of the year. Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And is that one point... Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yeah I... Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC : I'm sorry, go ahead, Andrew. I was just... Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: When it \u2013 relative to, specifically into energy and are we seeing price pressures, like everybody, we've gotten the letters that say, we'd love to see you reduce your prices. The beauty of the typical positioning that we have in terms of it being very, very high cost of failure, critical componentry is, we really don't typically end up having to give that price up, and we haven't yet had to do that that we've seen. Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Got it. And that one point of price, Heath, is that net of inflation, or is that just gross? Heath A. Mitts - IDEX Corp.: It's just gross. But given where inflationary pressures are this year, being lower than maybe historical norms, certainly the spread between what we see as inflation and what our gross price is has remained consistent with what we've seen in prior years. Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC : If I could sneak one more in. Just on M&A, Andrew, maybe just touch on, with going forward and the properties that you see on the market, do you anticipate you'll be sticking to the size range that we've seen most recently in kind of this anywhere between $50 million and a couple hundred million dollars, you see any opportunity maybe to go a bit larger? And maybe add on to that which parts of the business you're seeing the most opportunities? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: So, I think our sweet spot is definitely in this $50 million to $200 million range. $50 million is big enough to have competitive relative scale, and that's important to us. So that $50 million to $200 million is definitely our sweet spot. That said, like I mentioned a few moments ago, we're always looking at some bigger things. And we certainly have the capacity to do it. We have both the balance sheet and the cash flow to accelerate M&A. Our funnel is good. Most of what's in our funnel tends to look like the things we've just done, generally. There are a few things that are meaningfully bigger. But as I said earlier, we tend to have \u2013 we tend to go at things of \u2013 that are big with a very skeptical eye, and so we'll continue to do that. And you should expect to see us continue to have the same discipline we have had consistently. In terms of where we're seeing them, it's a mix. It's a mix between really, across our different businesses and I really \u2013 I like what our funnel looks like generally, and I like the fact that it's pretty diverse. Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Allison Poliniak-Cusic from Wells Fargo. Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, guys. Good morning. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Hi, Allison. Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Just going back to energy for a second, obviously a lot of moving parts there, but are you getting a sense or at least some visibility towards where your bottom could be? Not that it's going to get better but with sort of a comfort level of volumes going forward? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yeah. I actually think we're probably pretty close to that right now. As we do our quarterly operating reviews here within \u2013 usually within a couple weeks of the call. And what I would say is the team feels pretty good that as we go into the third quarter and the fourth quarter, that we're seeing a bottoming of that generally, and \u2013 which is good. That being said, what we're saying is manage really tight there just because you know how quickly things can move in that industry in terms of overall activity. So we're being cautious, but it does feel like we're closer to a bottom than certainly, I would have said 90 days ago. Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : No. That's great. And then, just going back to acquisitions. One, any change is given sort of the global macro-uncertainty, and maybe there's not in terms of potential opportunities here. And then second, just your \u2013 the thoughts behind managerial capacity, I mean, would you be adverse to doing another one, say in Scientific Fluidics, just because you did one recently? I mean, your thoughts on... Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: No, I actually \u2013 one of the changes, or one of the really good things that comes out of this organizational change that we announced is that not only does it kind of free up more capacity on what I'll call the cultivation and \u2013 I'll call it the deal side of acquisitions, right? It also frees up quite a bit of capacity on the integration side. And so, I feel really good about, if I look at the team that's underneath there, so to speak, their ability to build across that organizational structure, that was a big piece of how we thought about this change is, can we integrate meaningfully? One of the nice parts about the structure of our business as you know, Allison, just because you know the structure better than most, is that it allows us to do multiple acquisitions without taxing any one leadership team too much. So, all three of the deals that have been done have been in different parts of the business, and certainly, it wouldn't make us nervous to do another deal, actually in any one part of the three parts. I would not be nervous from a managerial perspective to go and put another business, another valve business as an example. That would not \u2013 I would not shy away from that because I think we've got the managerial capacity to do it. Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : That's great. Thank you. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Douglass from Longbow Research. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC : Hi. Good morning, gentlemen. Andy, looking again at FMT, you're down low-single digits with your exposure to energy (38:23) that doesn't seem too bad, actually. Can you explain how \u2013 is it new products, share gains, supporting the sales there? I know you said Water was pretty good and Europe okay... Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: I would say it's actually it's three things in particular. So Water is a big piece of it, no doubt about it. The team there has performed really well, and the municipal markets are up. So that's been \u2013 that's a positive story. New products has also been a big piece of the story. So we were at the largest show here in Europe two weeks, three weeks ago, three weeks ago, I guess it was, and we had a handful of new products that were really different than what you saw through the rest of the industry. And so products that are definitely growing and taking some share. So that's a piece of it. And then, the other piece is, you go back over the last three years or four years and we said we were going to cut and build, we said we were going to move some cash from different parts of the organization and invest in growth, and I think that's what is a big piece of that story there. So, honestly, we hadn't really talked about that. We didn't put it into our script and talk about it because it's hard to talk about your growth initiatives when it's negative, but truth be told, the \u2013 we have had a lower impact to the overall conditions because of some of the organic investments that we've been making. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC : Yeah. I think that's pretty clear. With MPT, you talked about a longer CapEx cycle businesses lagging. What longer-cycle types of businesses are we talking about? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yeah. That's \u2013 it's one of our few business. We only have a few that are lumpy like that, where orders can be larger, number one, and number two, the lead times can be six months, nine months versus our typical days, or certainly within a quarter. And so, we \u2013 that lumpiness we can see, and we definitely look at the back half this year, we know kind of where things are, where order schedules are, so we know it's going to be softer in the back half. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC : But what markets are we talking about? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Oh, I'm sorry. Food and Pharma. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC : Food and Pharma? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yeah, Food and Pharma, principally. Sorry. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC : That's fine. Is that just something unique to where you are within Food and Pharma? Because other companies shouldn't be saying that Food and Pharma investment is good, I mean... Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: No, it \u2013 Mark, it's not a demand issue, it's a lead time issue. Yeah, all right? So imagine, you guys, you got a big pharmaceutical facility or large food facility or major project. Those things have long lead times. Hence, they're ordering equipment six months, nine months in advance of shipment. And \u2013 so that's just a relatively unusual type of business for IDEX. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC : Sure, sure. Okay. Thanks for taking my question. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: You bet, Mark. Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Giordano from Cowen. Joseph C. Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just \u2013 we've talked about this a bit already, but just on the commentary about June picking up and July getting better, that does seem to be a bit of an outlier versus some of the other commentary we've heard. So, is there anything \u2013 you called out Water, is there anything particular where you think you're doing better than the actual market and this is kind of an IDEX story more than a market story? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yeah, so let me just be very, very clear. That improvement was from a really crappy May. Joseph C. Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Sure. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: So, it's not like we're gangbusters, and so please, nobody take that away from that commentary. So really, what we saw was June overall being stronger than April and substantially up from May, and in the first part of July, holding that trend. So what I would say is, is May was very disappointing \u2013 April was disappointing, May was very disappointing, and I'm talking principally about FMT industrial side of things. And then June came back more in line with our expectations, and that's why we hold confidence in the balance of the year. Joseph C. Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Fair enough. Wanted to talk about M&A a bit. You've been able to pull the trigger on a couple deals here, and that had been something that we'd been seeing a bit of a delay and then a disconnect between bid and ask, I guess. And so, maybe some comments on what allowed you to bridge that gap. Is it you guys stretching a bit more? Maybe private companies being able to come off a little bit with what their \u2013 a more normalized expectation maybe? And maybe comment broadly about what's \u2013 kind of how that movement's been happening now. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: The cultivation cycle in our business, you get out of auctions, right? You just kind of talk about private transactions. But the cultivation cycle is just really long. These are private companies, a founder has built it. Not only do you have kind of the typical deal process, but you also have all the things that are involved in, in a family or a private transition. And so, timing can just be \u2013 things can just take time, and we've been working on all three of these for quite some time and they finally broke. And obviously, we signaled that we thought that was going to happen, and they did finally break. So, we did not pay an excessive multiple for any one of them. We feel very, very good, it's kind of in the spot where we think we will have great returns, yet we pay a fair price, and this is \u2013 those are the kind of deals that we really want to do. The overall market, I don't think the market's changed, except for maybe it's just kind of funny July 4 happens, and all the deal books show up. You can't help it but just kind of laugh at that. But I'd say generally, overall market conditions are pretty similar. The one thing you are seeing is you're seeing conversations around the energy space. You're seeing deal conversations either developing quickly or falling apart quickly based on the businesses, their financials, right? So we were in conversations with a lot of these things, and you're seeing some financials significantly change. And so, you've just got to be really, really careful around that. I still think we're probably two quarters away from, I'll call it rational expectations around valuation in that space. And then, we'll see kind of how this year plays out and the first part of next year whether or not we're right. Joseph C. Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. And then just one quick one on the guidance. You \u2013 your current guidance for the full year, that assumes no benefit from the three acquisitions, right? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yeah. So Heath, do you want to talk about that? Heath A. Mitts - IDEX Corp.: Sure. Yeah. Just given where the step-up, the purchase price accounting kicks in, in terms of the asset write-up, and then the associated bleed-off relative to what the operating results will be from those businesses, on a GAAP basis, it pretty well washes itself out. Obviously, on a cash basis, it kicks in right away because those step-up charges are all non-cash. But from a P&L \u2013 from a bottom line perspective on a GAAP basis, it's pretty well a wash through the end of the year (45:55)... Joseph C. Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. And you're going to present \u2013 you're going to \u2013 the way you're going present it, you're going to eat those costs, right? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Correct. Yeah. Well, we'll... Joseph C. Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Okay. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: We'll get the P bit, (46:02) we'll eat the costs. They'll offset for the balance of this year. Joseph C. Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Sounds good. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bhupender Bohra from Jefferies. Bhupender Singh Bohra - Jefferies LLC : Hey. Good morning, guys. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Morning. Bhupender Singh Bohra - Jefferies LLC : So, my question, actually again, on the guidance in the second half. If I \u2013 I mean, you have brought your core sales growth expectations kind of flat now, so if I look at the first half, it's about averaged down like 3%. So it kind of tells me like second half is going to be a little bit higher to kind of get to that flat here. Can you just comment on like where do you see that growth coming from, like on the core side? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yeah. So the comps get \u2013 definitely get easier in the fourth quarter. And so, again, we're not seeing \u2013 we're not expecting a big acceleration of any kind on a sequential basis. The \u2013 as we said before, I think the third quarter is, call it zero to up 1%, plus or minus, and so we do expect that the fourth quarter will be a little bit better, but mostly off of some pretty easy comps relative to what we've seen the rest of this year. Bhupender Singh Bohra - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And the second question on the new cost actions. If you can, just give more color. I believe you mentioned that the cost actions will not be more than $8 million. Now, can you give me \u2013 give us some big buckets where those cost actions would be? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Bhupender, they're relatively evenly spread across most of the businesses. Obviously, there's some volume-based adjustments, given the lower volumes in some of the more industrial exposed businesses, but they spread across all three of the reported segments. The cost, we're estimating not to exceed \u2013 the restructuring costs not to exceed $8 million. Those will have a benefit, an annualized benefit that's better than that, and we'll call out more specifically what that is, as we complete those actions. Bhupender Singh Bohra - Jefferies LLC : But nothing is built in the second half for those cost-outs, right? Any savings? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Not \u2013 nothing specifically, because the actions, most of which have already been announced internally, kind of stagger through to the end of the year. Bhupender Singh Bohra - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thank you. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Okay. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we have no further questions. I will turn the call back over to Andrew Silvernail for closing comments. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Well, thank you very much, and I appreciate everybody joining us today. As always, we appreciate your support as shareholders. We think in a pretty difficult environment, that our teams are executing well, and we continue to push forward and make sure we that we close out the year and deliver for you, our shareholders. So, thank you again, and we will talk to you here in 90 days. Take care. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

As we begin, a brief reminder. This call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the Safe Harbor language in today's press release, and in IDEX's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I'll turn this call over to our Chairman and CEO, Andy Silvernail. Andrew Silvernail : Thanks, Mike and good morning, everybody. I appreciate you joining us here for the third quarter 2015 call. As we all know 2015 has been pretty challenging. We talked about in previous calls the softness we\u2019ve seen in the Ag market, in oil and gas within the strong U.S. dollar. In the second quarter we noted that we had seen some slippage in industrial distribution in the first half of the quarter and we definitely saw that come back in the third quarter. And while these market conditions are out there and they remain, we have been very focussed on delivering quality of earnings and cash flow making sure that we are funding our best investments internally and also really leveraging the benefits of our well positioned diversified portfolio. I am pleased overall with the execution that we had in the third quarter and we saw some pretty decent numbers given the conditions. We delivered $0.89 of adjusted EPS which is a penny ahead of last year. We had operating margins that were 21.5% which is 70 basis points better than last year, in particular we had impressive margins increase of 460 basis points in fire safety and diversified and I\u2019ll take some time here a little bit later in the call to give some more color there. We also had free cash flow that is $105 million which is a 132% of net income and we continue to focus our capital deployment. We closed the CiDRA acquisition. We divested a small product line business in Ismatec that had $18.1 million gain and we repurchased 911,000 shares for $66 million in the quarter. As I talked about in the second quarter, we\u2019ve also taken further steps to improve our cost structure through restructuring in all segments. In total we now expect to spend about $8 million to $10 million in the year with significant savings in 2016. For the full year we now expect EPS to be $3.50 to $3.53 and even though we have the challenges that I have noted here in 2015 we\u2019re going to take them head on, we\u2019re going to continue to invest in our businesses, we are going to grow in select areas and we\u2019re going to drive productivity across all segments. Again, I\u2019ll give some color here more in a moment, but before I do that let me talk about what we\u2019re seeing in regions around the world, some end markets and also talk about capital deployment. In North America, as we all know oil and gas in the Ag markets have continued to be pretty difficult. As I mentioned before, industrial distribution did soften in the second quarter and continuing to the third and we do expect these conditions to continue here in the fourth quarter. Europe remained stable although we have seen pockets of growth particularly in water and dispensing and we have seen some uptick in our energy business coming out of our European units. This has been offset by the continued weakness we are seeing in Eastern Europe from the political instability. China, the story really remains the same. It\u2019s been in line with our expectations. It has been weak here for some time, but we don\u2019t expect it to deteriorate any further from here. Even though we are seeing some headwinds there are some pretty nice -- there is some pretty nice momentum across geographies in a number of markets and these include life sciences, municipal and in dispensing. In total, we think that our current guidance captures their market conditions that I\u2019ve talked about here. With that let me turn to capital deployment. This has been a real highlight for us in 2015 as we talked about here for quite some time we have a four pronged approach to capital deployment. Number one is really maximizing organic growth, two, consistent dividends, three repurchasing shares when we believe it\u2019s below the intrinsic value of the company and four importantly strategic M&A. On the organic growth front we\u2019ve been investing aggressively and these conditions although they can be difficult they really are fertile times for investing in organic growth. You see a lot of indiscriminate cutting by a lot of it from competitors, and what we\u2019re able to do is really focus on driving productivity, reinvesting into the growth areas and continue to expand margins and cash flow. We\u2019re going to continue to reallocate people and resources towards our best opportunities where we can drive differentiation, we can drive growth and we can gain high relative market share. Some examples here in 2015 are the Viking Motor Speed pump, our fluidics systems for life sciences, our GAST 86/87 Rocking Piston and our StrongArm and Rescue that we launched earlier in the year. Turning to dividends and share repurchase. In the past three years, we\u2019ve increased our dividend by two thirds and in the recent quarter here we are declaring our $0.32 dividend and for the year we\u2019ve repurchased 2.4 million shares for $179 million and you can expect this year about a 3% share reduction here in 2015. In terms of M&A side, we\u2019ve deployed about $200 million this year in three different acquisitions, Novotema, Alfa Valvole and CiDRA Precision Services and those lay across three different businesses within IDEX and the M&A funnel continues to be strong and we\u2019ve got opportunities across our segment. Going forward you should expect to see us continuing to leverage our balance sheet and strong free cash flows in this important strategic priority. All right, let me now turn to the third quarter results. I\u2019m on slide four. Orders were $485 million; they were down 4% in total, down 2% organically. For the quarter revenues were $504 million down 6%, down 4% organically. We\u2019ve talked about the major contributors in terms of oil and gas the Ag markets and slowing North American industrial, however op margins of free cash flow were both very strong in the quarter. Operating margins as I noted were up 70 basis points to 21.5%. Free cash flow was $105 million converting the 132% of net income and as I said EPS for the quarter was $0.89 up a penny from last year. And again overall I\u2019m pleased with the execution and pleased with the discipline that our team that are bringing to this challenging market place. With that, let me turn to the segment discussions. I'm on Slide 5, and I\u2019ll start with Fluid & Metering. FMT organic orders decreased 3% in the quarter, organic sales were down 4% primarily due to the challenges I\u2019ve already discussed. Operating margins were down 120 basis points in the quarter due to lower volume and non cash acquisition charges. Let me note however that if you remove the impact of the acquisition inventory charges for Alpha, FMT margins were actually flat year-over-year so that\u2019s nice performance in the face of some volume declines. In Water services, we\u2019ve had a strong global municipal market in particular in the U.S. we saw municipal business up about mid single digits of the quarter. The U.K. has also had improvements in the market place and we\u2019ve won share with new products and across the platform we\u2019ve had margin expansion and I expect to see that performance continue to really through the balance of this year and into 2016. In industrial I\u2019ve already talked about what we are seeing in the overall markets and this is true in our pump business and we do expect those conditions to continue through the year. However, if you look at North America and Europe, particularly in the Chemical businesses we are seeing low single digit growth and we\u2019re seeing nice momentum as we enter 2016. In Energy, we\u2019ve actually had a surprisingly good story here. Overall top line remains stable in this environment, we\u2019ve kept price and we\u2019ve seen some business uptick in the European and Middle East and downstream projects that have rebounded here recently. This has been offset however by the issues that we are seeing in North American oil and gas. Outside the large projects if you look at North America we\u2019re seeing strength in aviation due to lower fuel prices but our mobile business has been a little bit slacky as we expect the truck builds to slow down into 2015 and in 2016. On the Ag front you know the story very well. We\u2019ve had weakness here throughout the year as we expected. We do expect that to continue in 2016 but again this is a business that in the long term has been favourable for us and we believe we\u2019ll continue to be overtime. All right let me turn to slide six and we are talking about Health & Science. In the quarter, organic order growth was up 2% while our organic sales were down 3%. Margins -- op margins decreased 40 basis points really driven by business mix. In terms of the different platforms, Scientific Fluidics, it really continues to be a bright spot for us. It\u2019s been loosing strength in Analytical Instrumentation, in bio and in the IVD markets and we expect this demand to continue in 2015 and into 2016 In Sealing there\u2019s been a little bit of mixed bag. We\u2019ve seen some nice share wins in semi conductor. All of that has been offset by the weakness in upstream of oil and gas, but -- and we expect these conditions to really to continue throughout the balance of this year. Optics & Photonics has been stable in the quarter. And we saw the industrial and the laser optics business weaker, but underlying life sciences demand has been very solid, and again profitability continues to expand in this platform. HST industrial looks a lot like what we talked about in FMT with distribution softening, but the team has done an excellent job winning business in adjacent markets and continuing to improve productivity. The Material Process, it\u2019s actually a strong quarter for MPT. We saw strong orders and the momentum going to the fourth quarter really across a number of markets particularly in Asia. We expect to see the benefits of this in the early part of 2016 as you know this is a lumpier business for IDEX and we are seeing capital spending spotty overtime, but this is a good news story right now and into the early part of 2016. All right. Let me move onto the final segment. I\u2019m on Diversified on Slide 7. Organic orders were down 8%, and they decreased and organic sales were down 5%. The decline is principally driven by tough comps compared to the fire trailers of last year and softness with BAND-IT really with their depressed energy prices. As I mentioned earlier, we had operating margins that increased 460 basis points and this is a obviously a very impressive performance for the team, but I will caution you not to set that as a new benchmark. In the last few quarters we\u2019ve had outstanding business mix, specifically within the Dispensing and the Fire businesses and we expect in the future to see more normalized profitability. Dispensing has been a good news story for us across the globe; we\u2019ve seen strength in North America and Western Europe and in Asia. The wins that we are seeing have been driven by the improvement in overall construction markets but very importantly the strength of our X product which is growing to grow another 25% this year over last year. In Fire suppression the core North American and U.K. businesses have been in decent shape and although we don\u2019t expect any particularly large projects this year we are continuing to see nice wins in those domestic businesses and excellent profitability driven by productivity across the platform. In Rescue, we did see some delays in projects internationally but the North American business has continued to be strong, eDRAULIC 2.0 has taken share consistently and we launched our StrongArm tool which is the utility tool for fire and for our law enforcement markets and we think this is going to have nice momentum going into 2016. Finally, looking at BAND-IT and as we talked about the conditions have been difficult. The industrial distribution and the oil and gas businesses have been challenging to BAND-IT, but the transportation segment has continued to grow. You know BAND-IT has been a bellwether for us, continues to perform and we have high expectations for the business going forward. All right. Let me conclude now with the fourth quarter and the full year 2015 guidance. I\u2019m on slide eight. For the fourth quarter we now expect EPS to be $0.88 to $0.91 and operating margins of 20.5%. The Q4 tax rate should be around 27% to 27.5% and we expect about a 3% top line headwind from FX. As I mentioned earlier we now expect full year to be EPS to be $3.50 or $3.53 and we expect revenue growth to decline about 2% to 3% and full year operating margins to be about 21%. All just a couple of the modelling items for you for the full year. We now expect FX to impact us by about $90 million for the year compared to $95 million from prior guidance and that\u2019s about $0.20 of EPS impact for the full year compared to 2014. CapEx should be about $45 million. Free cash flow of 120% of net income and again share repurchases should decrease the share count by about 3% for the year. Finally as always we need to exclude the impact of acquisitions both positive and negative and also take out the impact of restructuring charges and the gain of sale from the Ismatec product line. With that, Tim let me turn it over to you for questions from our audience. Operator : At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mike Halloran at Robert W. Baird. Michael Halloran : Can you hear me? Andrew Silvernail : Yes, hi Mike. Michael Halloran : Okay. So, a couple of one\u2019s here. First, on the HST side, you know I was a little surprised that organic revenue declined in the quarter but obviously the orders were pretty solid. So maybe talk a little bit if there was any blips in the quarter specifically that would\u2019ve maybe changed what the run rate is in that business and how you are thinking about the progression as we move into the fourth quarter in 2016? Andrew Silvernail : Yes so Mike on HST in particular things that were touching the scientific world life sciences in particular we saw strength anything touching food we had strengthened. It really -- that any weakness that we saw in the quarter was due to the industrial portion of it, principally around GAST. You know that been -- a lot more like FMT and that is any slowness we had there. The core scientific and health pieces of the business performed very well. Michael Halloran : And as you think about that on a run rate going forward is this an area where you are expecting organic growth in the fourth quarter or is that something that might normalize out as you hit next year in some of those MPT projects that you mentioned start rolling through. Andrew Silvernail : So if you think about 2016, I would expect that to be the case I think you\u2019ve got nice strength in Life Sciences and we will see in the early part of the year the benefit of the projects for MPT shifting. In the fourth quarter, net net I think you end up being flat year-over-year. Michael Halloran : And then more broadly as you work into 2015 here -- yeah I understand completely you are still going to be FX headwinds. As you worked into 2016 maybe you can just talk about some of the thoughts you guys are having internally going into next year, what are the buckets where you think that growth is going to be achievable as you hit next year and where do you think the headwinds are going to persist as we go into next year? Is that just an early read on what you are seeing in the environment today and what that tells you about next year? Andrew Silvernail : I think the biggest headwinds we are going to see are going to be in the first and second quarter, which I think they will be meaningful, right. So the fall off in spending that I think everyone has experienced relative to the capital projects in oil and gas I think they really, in terms of from a comp perspective they are going to be tougher in the first and early in the second quarter and get a little bit easy as you get into the third and the fourth quarter next year, I think that will absolutely be the case. You know Ag is a little bit of wild card to be honest with you, Mike it\u2019s a little bit tough to find the bottom there. I think everyone -- you guys have seen what\u2019s happened with the big capital producers, but net net I don\u2019t see that as a big negative. You know going into next year I think that biggest question mark is going to be what happens with industrial because the North American industrial business and what happens with China. Those are the two things that I think are the biggest question marks going into the really the fourth quarter. I think the fourth quarter we got pretty dialled in, but I think as you go into next year those are the biggest things. In terms of upsides, I think municipals can continue to be good. All signs continue to point to that, and I think that the scientific piece of our business in Life Sciences whether it\u2019s analytical instrumentation or bio IVT, those are good new stories to come you know really across the board. And you\u2019ve had a lot of headwind from you know FX that you know we start to lap here as we get into the back half of this year first part of back half of the fourth quarter first part of next year. And we\u2019ll see how that plays itself out.  But, Mike I\u2019ve said pretty consistently that I expect 2016 to be a slugfest. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to -- that market conditions are going to be meaningfully different from what we\u2019ve seen and it\u2019s going to be about being very smart with internal capital deployment meaning where we invest in our businesses, driving productivity and very smart external capital deployment. Michael Halloran : Thanks a lot. And just one last one from me, obviously grade FSD margins, recognizing that those aren\u2019t sustainable, you highlighted the normalization you expect, how do you define normalization? Is that towards something that 26 kind of range for that segment on the margin line or should we be thinking about a little bit different now? Andrew Silvernail : Mike, I think modelling is -- you know given the relative size of the segment within the portfolio you know $1 million here there can swing the percentages round quite a bit. So but I think modelling probably between that 26 and 28 range is fair. Michael Halloran : All right. Thanks guys, appreciate it. Andrew Silvernail : Thanks Mike. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker at Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Peter Lennox-King: Hi, everybody. This is Peter Lennox-King on for Steve. I was wondering if you could maybe talk me through a little bit more detail on the restructuring front. Is the allocation between the segments for the remaining $3 million to $5 million or so that's in the guidance, is that allocation going to be similar to what you had in Q3? And then could you talk through a little bit of the payback timing, the magnitude and where \u2013 how big the benefits will be for each segment as much as you can? Andrew Silvernail : I think the spread as you noticed in our adjustments that we made by segment was a little heavier towards FMT and HST in the third with the Fire and Safety, the Diversified business only receiving about $300,000 of that charge. It will probably be a little bit more ratable in the fourth quarter, but still heavier towards FMT and HST. In terms of the aggregate payback for that, so we're going taking a charge of somewhere between $8 million and $10 million in the second half of the year. You can assume that, that payback has somewhere less than the one year payback, so obviously the benefit from that which we will quantify as we go into next year's guidance here on our January call will be somewhere north of the charge. Peter Lennox-King: Okay. Thanks. And then maybe shifting gears a little bit back to capital deployment. Can you talk a little bit about the M&A pipeline, how you thinking about getting more aggressive, less aggressive in the current environment with other volatility. And then again as much as you can which segment you're sort of targeting or which businesses you're looking to really move on? Andrew Silvernail : So, Peter in terms of the segments we actually looking at things across the three segments. And there are some things that we've been cultivating quite some time piece of things that have deployed in the recent past that make our pipeline pretty attractive. We feel good about where our pipeline is generally both in the near term and in the longer term. And so, we feel pretty good here about our ability to execute on M&A. Maybe in the balance of this year, maybe not, we'll see. As you know these things move around quite a bit, but certainly as we go into 2016 we have an expectation of doing so. And as you know, we've made an important organizational change here in earlier this year and a big piece of it was really freeing the organization to be more aggressive around M&A. We've got a great balance sheet as you know. Our cash flows are terrific. And we think that we have the organizational structure to do it. The environment is an interesting one, right because this is an environment as you pointed out, Peter, is very volatile. At the same time as you say, sometimes you got to take cookies when they are passed. And there are some pretty nice properties that are out there. You may not buy them at the perfect time, but at the same time we understand what we're looking for and we're looking for businesses that are structurally fit over the very, very long terms and are going to deliver high returns for shareholders. Peter Lennox-King: Great. Thank you. And just one final follow-up there. The aggregate spend over time that you're look at, is that still thinking about the same, same sort of size, range there and the same individual \u2013 size of individual deals as well? Andrew Silvernail : Yes. I mean, our sweet spot is that kind of $50 to $200, $250 million that really is our sweet spot. As I've said in the past there are few things that are larger that are north of $1 billion, that we look at consistently. Those are few and far between. But there are some that are out there. But our sweet spot and where we really drive value for shareholders is in that $50 million to 250 million dollar range. Peter Lennox-King: Great. Thank you very much. Andrew Silvernail : Thanks, Peter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt McConnell at RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Matt McConnell : Thank you. Good morning, guys. Andrew Silvernail : Hi, Matt. Matt McConnell : So, guidance for the fourth quarter, it seems like organic revenue declines are moderating. Is that what you intended to incorporate in the outlook? And how much of that it's coming from an easier comp in Fire and Safety versus any kind of stabilization or sequential improvement in the other two segments? Andrew Silvernail : Matt, we're not expecting sequential improvement. It really comes down to comps when you look at the fourth quarter. I think this environment right now is squishy enough that any belief that we're going to see a material change in the external environment in the fourth quarter I think that will be misplaced. Matt McConnell : Okay, great. Thanks. And just a quick follow-up, Andy, you made a comment that China, you don't expect to deteriorate from here. Is that based on specific customer conversations or just? What gives you the confidence to make that kind of declaration? Andrew Silvernail : You know, we've had a pretty tight beat on China, if you remember, if you look back even, a year or 18 months ago. Yes, we started talking about the fact that we thought the China was meaningful weaker than call it the headline commentary. And for us it really is kind of looking at the underline business and where we are seeing demand, our Richter business in particular continues to be strong in China and that's been our real winner for us. We do expect our rescue business to pick up here as we look at the balance of this year and into 2016. So, it's much more specific to the businesses that we're in versus a call on the China economy. Matt McConnell : Yes. Okay, great. Thanks. And last one just a follow-up on the capital allocation question, could you been really aggressive with the buybacks, but clearly pretty happy about the M&A pipeline and opportunities. Is there a self imposed leverage threshold where you might slowdown the buybacks? Or what kind of deal do you have capacity for right now given that you spend quite a bit of your free cash flow this year? Andrew Silvernail : You know, we're still only sitting at just north of turn in net debt, right. So we've got a great balance sheet. So I'm not awfully concerned about that and obviously the free cash flow is very, very strong. When its all said and done, when you put the two side by side our preference is strategic M&A, it certainly creates more value unless you have a major dislocation in the stock price. And so, obviously as we move down that path and as deals come through we would naturally slow down M&A. But \u2013 excuse me, slow down repurchases, but let me know really clearly, our repurchase program is 100% driven and what we believe the intrinsic value is of the company. And you'll see our acceleration or deceleration based on a very, very well thought out analysis of what we think that is. So, as an example when we saw the stock kind of dropdown into the 60s earlier this year, we were lot more aggressive than we are today. And when the stock is up closer to 80 we were then buying back closer to half to 1%. So, strategic M&A is number one, we got plenty of capacity to do that and share buybacks are driven 100% above value. Matt McConnell : Great. Thanks very much. Andrew Silvernail : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Maczka at BB&T Capital Markets. Kevin, please proceed with your question. Kevin Maczka : Thanks. Good morning. Andrew Silvernail : Hi, Kevin. Kevin Maczka : So, kind of an encouraging comments here within FMT on the muni water side and really on energy side too. I'm wondering if you can say a little bit more about that muni water spend. What you're seeing, how you think that plays out going into next year, if there's any kind of submarkets that are driving that? And then on the European energy side, what's driving the pickup there? Andrew Silvernail : Sure. On the muni side, couple of things, number one, a general uptick in overall spending driven by tax receipts. And we've talked about for a long time that there is any time you start to see major movements in tax receipt there's kind of 12 to 24 months lag or lead time depending upon which side of a cycle you're on. And so those tax receipts are starting to lift all boats so to speak. There's just more money in the CapEx and in the OpEx budgets in the Western parts of the world than they were 12, 24 months ago, so that's one thing. The second thing is it's really our strategy in particular in water services has paid off. So we have continued to win share in our target markets, target applications and that's what's driving the success above and beyond markets. So as I look at 2016, we know what's in the co-pipeline. We know what we won and we believe we feel pretty confident that market is going to be better than there was this year and certainly better than it's been in the last couple of years. So, in combination its not like it's roaring at high single-digit or double-digit, but a solid mid single-digit in the U.S. in municipal water, that's a good piece of news generally. In terms of the energy side, I wouldn't get too excited about that. And what I mean by that is our holding our topline; you've got to remember a couple of things. First, we really don't play very much in the downhole side of the world, right. So as we said in the past, that's been 2%, 3% of our total portfolio for IDEX, obviously that 2% or 3% has been battered this year with the reductions that you've seen. But we mostly play in that midstream market that is held up better, so that's kind of one thing to remember. Second thing is we've had some really nice wins in aviation, that have been really share wins for us and we've seen that across the globe. The third is there are number of projects that we've been on top of that -- in the past we've talk about the fact, they got pushed out and we didn't win. And we're starting to see those flow through in Europe and the Middle East. I would not say that is commentary about the health of the overall market, but more so our business unit performance. Kevin Maczka : Got it. And Andy, in terms of price, it sounds like you've held price on the energy side. Are there some other areas whether it's in FMT or beyond where you've been able to get some price or maybe you had some pressure? Andrew Silvernail : Actually, no pressure. I mean, we get the letters that everybody else gets from our customers. But at the end of the day, we'll command what, Health north of a point this year, right around the point. A - Heath Mitts Right, around the point. Andrew Silvernail : Yes. We'll get a point of price here before the inflationary impacts in terms to net it out. But we'll get a point of price this year with no significant places of price pressure. Kevin Maczka : Got it. And just finally from me on mix, from time-to-time it can be such a big margin mover this quarter. Of course we saw it in FSD. And it doesn't sound like you're expecting that sustain. But I'm just wondering kind of across the portfolio is there anything in terms of the visibility that you do have that we ought to be aware about in terms of mix, either positive or negative as we look at Q4 or maybe even in the next year? Andrew Silvernail : Well, a few things. Generally as a portfolio the only place we see mix impact us significantly is in FSD. In the last two quarters that has been, obviously its been a good news story for and we're caution you guys not to build margin assumptions north of that 28% range to 26% to 28%, that Heath gave earlier, I think that's a healthy place to be. In terms of FMT or HST, I don't expect there to be major mix shifts within those businesses here and there, but not enough to long term change the trajectory of the business. Within FSD in particular, right, on the margins, if you go back in time, the margin there have been moving up substantially. We really improve the profit profile of fire and of dispensing. And that has change the overall profit profile of FSD. We're at the point now where I don't expect to kind of gains we've had to replicate themselves and I think we're in a pretty good spot there in particular. Kevin Maczka : Okay. Thank you. Andrew Silvernail : Thanks, Kevin. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak at Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Allison Poliniak : Hi, guys, good morning. Andrew Silvernail : Hi, Allison. Allison Poliniak : Just going back to MPT, obviously more positive on there, when you talk about that order growth was it essentially projects that we should have seen in 2015, got push to 2016 and I guess what the risk if that's the case to 2016 orders right now? Andrew Silvernail : So, as you know Allison, this is \u2013 if we have any place that's lumpy, this is it. And you can see some pretty significant swings that can move the organic orders and organic sales for HST in a quarter in a more meaningful way than some of the other businesses. So, what you're seeing right now is we had some nice wins here in the quarter that help certainly on the organic order front and they really going to shift in the second part, excuse me, in the first part of 2016. In terms of what that means looking forward, at this point we don't have visibility kind of for the fourth quarter and third quarter and orders that might look like this. Maybe we got a lot of stuff in the hopper, but there's nothing that makes me particularly excited or particularly concern relative to that and how it would be play out in the fourth quarter and therefore later in 2016. Allison Poliniak : Great. That's helpful. And I'm sorry to go back to the FSD margin. If I'm looking at nice expansion this quarter, I guess based on your commentary can I assume half of that was driven by mix with the balance being the productivity efforts or is my math off? Andrew Silvernail : It's probably a little bit more than that. In general the mix impact I would say, its probably more like two-thirds to three quarters and I'm kind of thump nailing on it here. But the productivity, we definitely saw nice productivity, but we did have a meaningful mix shift in those two businesses. Allison Poliniak : Great. Thank you. Andrew Silvernail : Thank you, Allison. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Radigan at KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. Joe Radigan : Thanks. Good morning guys. Andrew Silvernail : Good morning. Joe Radigan : The sequential margin decline in FMT and HST, was that largely a function of the inventory step up and then more generally how do you think about margins sustainability across IDEX, and what looks like its going to be a relatively protracted slow growth environment going forward here? Andrew Silvernail : So, specific to FMT, the step up, that was a meaningful impact from quarter-to-quarter ended I said, it actually normalized for the inventory step up charge on the year-over-year basis FMT margins would have been flat. So you kind of back into what that tells you there. So, really on volume being down modestly, pretty nice performance in the business in terms of profitability. From an HST perspective, nothing really meaningful in there, there's nothing that I would signals one way the other any change in margin profile. If you look at the longer term, we've said pretty consistently that in a low growth environment call it 2%, 3% somewhere near. We can get 50 to 80 basis points maybe up to 100 basis points depending upon what happens in profit improvement. But if you look at \u2013 if you're in the 2% range you're probably looking at 50 basis points, you're in the 3% range, you're probably looking at 80 basis points of expansion. Just because our contribution margins are in the low 60s, snd so that plays itself through very helpfully and we can continue to invest in the business. Obviously if we get a benefit and few things pick up faster, you're going to reinvest even more which you're still going to see really, really nice margin expansion. So even if we continue to be in this environment, I feel good that if we see just modest improvements in top line we're going to continue to expand margins in the core portfolio. Joe Radigan : Okay. And then, within the optics and photonics business, that I think commentary for the last few quarters has been stable, maybe weaken a little bit this quarter, but what needs to happen for that business to start growing again, is it really the industrial and market that's holding it back or what, any commentary there? Andrew Silvernail : It is, right, so if you look at \u2013 if you separate out the life science piece which is performing, continues to perform well in the core life science market. You're now talking about the industrial and the semiconductor market and in both of those and either one of those had been particular strong. So -- and also to be fair to our team running the business there, we have been really tight on making sure that we're going after attractive business, and so part of it has been self-proposed to make sure that we're going after the right business there. But if you get an improvement in the industrial and the electronics world you will see some nice pickup. Joe Radigan : Okay. And then maybe lastly Andy, as you look at acquisitions, how do you get comfortable with the forward projections in this sort of demand environment. Is that -- has that been an impediment in getting deals to the finish line? Or how do you think about that? Andrew Silvernail : So, the way I kind of thing about is what's the business is going to look like through a cycle and you'll never buy perfectly, right, but what you're trying to avoid is buying something that's going to have kind of really aggressive secular downturn number one, or something we are really buying on the comp. And those are the two situations that you get yourself into trouble in terms of kind of building in any type of -- from a growth perspective. Generally, we're looking at businesses. I'll use Alfa as an example, right, so, Alfa is a business with 30 plus year still based. You can kind of look at it through a cycle and even if you don't buy it perfectly, buy it from a perfect time in the cycle, by the time you get on the back half of any kind of slowdown you're still thrilled, you own the business. So, you have high cash on cash returns, high cash flow businesses. You know what a cycle generally is going to look like. You may not pick it perfectly, but if you're buying and what I call an IDEX like business you don't have to time the market perfectly or get the price exactly right to having be a huge winner for you over time. And so, we're more looking for a quality of the business to recycle, high cash on cash returns in a business, strong repeat business installed based, a big mode defensibility and high relative market share. When you get that right, timing becomes lesser than issue than one might think. Joe Radigan : Got it. Thank you. Andrew Silvernail : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line Bhupender Bohra at Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Bhupender Bohra : Hi. Good morning, guys. Andrew Silvernail : Good morning. Bhupender Bohra : You guys actually spoke about industrial distribution business kind of weakness what we have seen here. Could you talk about like destocking, is that one of the issues within that the end market. And how long do you think if you have availability on that like the destocking or the slowdown within the distribution channel will last? Andrew Silvernail : So, as we've said in the past unlike I think some of our peers, we don't have kind of what I would call a traditional industrial distribution channel. So we're not dealing with the big catalogue houses per say. We're dealing much more with value added distributors. So, we don't have huge stocking levels in the channel anyway. You have some obviously that's driving a lead time, and on time delivery, but you don't have months, and months and months of stocking in the channel. So, while I'm sure that is part it. I'm sure, part of what we're experiencing right now and others are experiencing has to do with them being tighter. I do think that you're seeing overall demand slaking. And then inventory in the end market I think it's tightening substantially. So, if you want to put destocking moniker or something, I would say its more at the end user who's gotten cautious. You have seen the repel effects just like we are, right, we're tightening down and working capital has been just slowing and you're seeing that play out across the landscape. And I do expect that to be tightened. And just like we've seen in the past when that starts to loosen again, you'll see a nice pop and that would be surprising upside in the quarter at some point. But right now I really that what we're all seeing is mostly a slowing of aggregate demand with a little bit of impact of the concept of destocking. Bhupender Bohra : Okay. Thanks a lot. And the other question, we have about $8 million to $10 million restructuring this year. Let's say, I don't know how much visibility we have for 2016, but can we actually if need be, if the environment actually slows down further and as we are looking at North America which is half of your business, seeing some slowdown here, again this morning like there were many other reports which came out talking about the weaken in the North America market, like what kind of cost cuts we can further kind of depend or kind of tap into some of the buckets that we can talk about? Andrew Silvernail : Bhupender, rest assured that if we continue to see the market downturn, we'll continue drive this types of savings that we need. I think you've seen that overtime with IDEX and know this. It's built into the way that we think about reacting to positions in terms of where we say cost structure wise. But also know that we do have areas that we need to continue to invest and we're not starving those parts of the business. It's important for the types of businesses that we have or we get spec [ph] on to platforms and instruments and so forth that we continue to invest, not miss those cycles. So, now the balancing act as always is to continue to make sure we free up the dollars to invest in the growth areas and the areas that are more strategic and require incremental investments and then go after the areas that tend to be more volume based and see as we do have pockets that we go after maybe. Bhupender Bohra : Okay. Andrew Silvernail : We feel pretty good about the actions we have relative to our assumptions set for 2016 and we quantify some of that in the January call. Bhupender Bohra : Okay. That's all. Thank you very much. Andrew Silvernail : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line Joe Giordano at Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Joe Giordano : Hi, guys. Good morning. Andrew Silvernail : Hi, Joe. Joe Giordano : Just a follow-on with the destocking question and I fully understand, I appreciate what you said about where you guys fall within that, but can you get the sense that your customers are more \u2013 are they destocking in an anticipatory fashion like more so than actual demand might require this time or they kind of anticipating even further declines from here? Do you get that feel? Andrew Silvernail : It's hard to get that. Obviously, we're pretty close to our customers. I think cautiousness is out there across the board, and so there probably is some of that \u2013 probably the best way to think of it is look at ourselves, right and how we're behaving. And as we see in this environment we are tightening down our overall inventory and being more cautious about what we bring in and what goes out. So I think there is a level of cautiousness out there. They can start to feed on itself a little bit. But to be candid, Joe, I don't think I have tight enough bead to be able to call that exactly what's the mix of actual demand versus cautiousness. I mean, typically as we always see people react too slowly at first and too quickly at the end. It is always a mix of that. But I think right now I think we got a pretty good bead on certainly what the fourth quarter looks like and I think that next year is going to be a pretty slow growth environment. Joe Giordano : Great. Appreciate it. Thanks, guys. Andrew Silvernail : Thanks, Joe. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville at Alembic Global Advisors. Please proceed with your question. Matt Summerville : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Couple of questions. First, just in terms of the global chemical market, it's not an inconsequential end market for you guys. It's about 20% or so FMT. Can you give a little more specificity regionally what you're seeing there and I guess again high level, I get it how you're thinking about that for 2016 and then I also have a follow-up? Andrew Silvernail : So, Matt, what we're seeing in North America and in Europe is I'm going to call it a low single-digit growth environment, and so its holding up pretty well. China has been a little bit better, but I think that's driven more by our own actions particular with the Richter brand than it is necessarily what we're seeing in end markets. And India has been pretty good for us too. So, really across the board in the markets that we play in chemical has been \u2013 I'm going to call it good new story in a slow growth world. So it's not like its racing ahead, but it's been solid. And I expect that to continue into 2016. If you look at the business in terms of the pipeline what we're looking at, our expectations coming out of our unit, I think expecting a low single digit environment 2% to 3% is probably a good place to put your bets. Matt Summerville : And then with respect to China, since you specifically brought it up talking about chemical. When you came in to 2015 what did you expect your organic growth rate to be in China and where do you actually think it ends up for the year? Andrew Silvernail : Are you talking about chemical or you talking about China in total? Matt Summerville : Total IDEX, China? Andrew Silvernail : Okay. So total IDEX China. So, we expect it kind of mid single-digit growth China for the year. And remember that said, China is low \u2013 it's kind of a 5%, 6%, 7% of our total business, so doesn't necessarily move the needle in total at that level. And we've been plus or minus in that area. We have not been particularly disappointed nor are we overall pleased. So it's about at our expectation so far this year. Matt Summerville : And then just one last one with respect to oil and gas, and if you look across all the businesses that get impacted whether they been an FMT, HST or FSD. If you look at that 11% to 12% of total revenue that's in oil and gas, you mentioned that you're going to be relatively flat for the full year. Can you bracket that a little bit upstream is going to down X percent, mid and down are going to be up X percent if that be the case, just a little more granularity there, please? Thank you. Andrew Silvernail : I'm going to spit-balling a little bit here Matt, so don't take this as gospel. But I know well exactly what's going on across our portfolio if you look at the upstream piece. Again, that was kind of 3% of our total business coming into the year, its more like 2% of our total business as we exit the year, so you're talking that's down a third. You think that are upstream. The midstream is going to be decent. So we don't play a lot as you get towards the pump so to speak, we don't play a lot there. But in the midstream which is a bulk of our business, that's going to be kind of flattish with our aero business being strong and our mobile business, it was actually strong in the first half of the year and its going to soften here in the second half of the year particularly as we look at truck built. So you know that net-net that probably ends up being flat for the year. Matt Summerville : Got it. Thanks a lot guys. Andrew Silvernail : Thanks Matt. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg at Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Brian Konigsberg : Close enough. Thanks, good morning. Andrew Silvernail : Good morning. Brian Konigsberg : Hey I just wanted to touch, just a little bit more on price cost and maybe I just read a little bit too much into it, but I guess I\u2019m used to you guys getting a little bit of net price maybe about 50 basis points net of inflation. It sounds like you are saying that\u2019s kind of more flattish now, I mean is that -- has that deteriorated a little bit or is it just where we are describing it? Andrew Silvernail : No I\u2019m sorry if you are confused by that at all, if we didn\u2019t communicate that well. No we\u2019ll get -- we\u2019ll get a point of price and we\u2019ll certainly get our typical you know half of that net of inflation. So, when it\u2019s all said and done it will be margin accretive to us for the year. Brian Konigsberg : Okay, so about 50 basis points for the year is still the expectation there. Andrew Silvernail : That\u2019s right. And that net of material inflation. Brian Konigsberg : Net of material and bureaucratic inflation? Andrew Silvernail : You see\u2026no net of material inflation is how we think about. Brian Konigsberg : Okay, net of materials. Got it. And then just secondly, just on working capital so there\u2019s just been some discussion about on the energy side which may not affect you as much as some tightening in collecting receivables just with the industrial environment the way it is and are you guys seeing any stress kind of collections within the custom base that might pose a challenge in working capital? Andrew Silvernail : We have and now we have a pretty conservative approach to places of the world that we tend to have in terms of more receivable risk in the emerging markets where we tend to do things on letter of credit or cash advance. But in the more mature markets where credit terms are issued we have not seen any degradation there. You have to remember we are dealing a lot times with people there, larger customers and people that we\u2019ve done business with for many years. Brian Konigsberg : Got it. Great, that\u2019s it from me. Thanks. Andrew Silvernail : Very good. Thank you. Operator : At this time there are no further questions in the audio portion of this conference. With that being said, I would like to turn the call back over to Andy Silvernail for closing remarks. Andrew Silvernail : Thanks Tim, I appreciate it. And you know once again I thank everybody for participating in this call and certainly for you know the support and the interest in IDEX. You know obviously we are facing a world that\u2019s challenging. It\u2019s -- we\u2019ve got some headwinds here and we expect that those are continuing in the balance of the year and into 2016 but across the board I am very pleased with how we are executing and really focussing on where we are going to put our resources in terms of organic growth and margin expansion and on the M&A front. So I appreciate it once again and we\u2019ll talk to you here in 90 days. Take care. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. And have a wonderful rest of your day.",

With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO Andy Silvernail. Andy Silvernail : Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everybody. I appreciate you joining us here for the fourth quarter call. A year ago when we were on this call, we talked about there being a difficult macro environment and the headwinds that really lay ahead for 2015. Those conditions played out and in fact played out a little bit more difficult than we had even anticipated. The reasons for it, I think everybody is aware of and they certainly did not escape us. We had the strong U.S. dollar which hit us significantly in the year. The impact of energy prices that really rippled through much of the industrial economy. There were low crop prices that hit farm income and ultimately hit the ag market. And those factors really played out in two major markets, in the U.S. industrial and in the Chinese industrial markets. And I think the conditions that we're seeing here today that we saw in 2015 and the conditions that we expect to see in 2016 are really impacted by that. That being said, the strength of our diversified and our balanced portfolio and the quality of our teams really demonstrated themselves here throughout the year. And I'm very proud of the execution of the teams through 2015 and our expectations are continuing to drive strong performance operationally in 2016. We saw this play out in the numbers in a handful of ways. Year over year, our gross margin was up by 60 basis points and our op margin was up by 30 basis points. We had an 80-basis-point improvement in op margin and HST and an impressive 120-basis-point improvement in op margin and fire safety diversified. We also generated $322 million of free cash flow. That was 114% conversion. And we got aggressive on restructuring in the back half of last year when we saw the softening happen in the second quarter. We spent about $11 million in restructuring and we're going to save about $12 million in total, $10 million incrementally in 2016. The other part of our strategy that really plays itself through and, I think, allows us to differentiate in this kind of environment, is our value-centric approach, very thoughtful approach to capital deployment. In this past year, we completed 3 acquisitions. We spent about $200 million. We retired an $81 million euro note. We also divested a small product line, our Ismatec business in scientific fluidics and it had a pretax gain of about $18 million. And we bought back 2.8 million shares, spending just over $200 million to do so. As I look at the year ahead, frankly, I think that 2016 is going to look a lot like 2015. The near term environment is one of slow growth overall, negative growth potentially. But our business fundamentals remain outstanding. If you look at the critical nature of our products, the large installed base and the high replacement costs, none of these things have changed. The moats around our businesses and our capability of driving very high returns in these businesses remains the same. And we will continue to focus on where we have strength in 2016 around operational improvement, around our positionings in the marketplace and around productivity and, of course, putting money to work intelligently for you, our shareholders. Before I get into the results for the year and for the quarter, let me take a second and just tell you what we're seeing in our markets and in regions around the world. First on the market side, if you look at energy and chemical, everyone is painfully aware of the difficulties in the energy market. We certainly have felt the impact of that in our energy business, BAND-IT and sealing solutions. As you know, we don't have a lot of exposure upstream. We do have some, but the bigger impact now is really the rippling CapEx effects as it moves through the industrial economy. The chemical side, we do expect it to be lower growth than it was in the year, but we still expect it to be a good news story in 2016. Industrial is really around the U.S. and China. If you look at industrial distribution in North America, it started softening in the second quarter of last year and that continued through the balance of the year. We do not think that that gets worse in 2016, but we do expect it to continue to be soft relative to history. On the ag side, the ag markets have been hit hard. Overall, farm income is down and we certainly see that play out for the OEM orders in the marketplace. But our position is very niche-y with our Banjo brand. We have outstanding positions. It is a terrific business and we just continue to really make sure that we're in the right places when a rebound does happen. Scientific fluidics and really the life-sciences businesses in general, continue to be a bright spot. They were in 2015 and we expect it again in 2016. And we really have terrific positioning in analytical instrumentation, bio and IBD. As I look at the new products that are coming to market, we know what our positioning looks like there and overall that is a good news story. Municipal is also a bright spot. We had low single-digit growth in 2015. We expect that momentum to continue into 2016 and we're seeing nice opportunities there also in terms of our ability to penetrate markets. In terms of regionally, I really have touched on this already, but just quickly - North America, the story is really around two different worlds. One is industrial which is very soft; the other is municipal and life-sciences which is solid. Europe - Western Europe is actually stable and in decent shape. And we think the conditions there will remain the same in 2016. And Asia which is really driven by China, there is no doubt that China is in an industrial recession, has been here for some time. We have certainly felt the pinch there. But I think it is important to note that we really view the long term opportunity in China with our business as being very good. And we have said this many times in the past; as things cycle downward, we often find ourselves being much more aggressive to be able to grow our business long term and take advantage of when others are being hesitant. The other part to our strategy and how we really differentiate is around capital deployment. And I already noted some of the things that we have done in 2015. But we're going to continue this four-pronged strategy that we laid out a number of years ago. So number one, we're going to fully fund organic growth and continue to make growth investments in good times and in challenging times. We're going to pay a consistent and robust dividend. We're going to buy back shares when we believe they are below intrinsic value. And we're going to execute on M&A. And we have done all of these things for the last handful of years and we're going to continue to ride that strategy. On the organic growth front, we have continued to focus in on markets and customers where we think we can significantly differentiate and we can grow highly profitable business. Some examples of that that we saw in 2015 playing out in 2016 are the launch of our StrongArm and our rescue business and certainly the terrific success of our fluidic systems and life sciences. In terms of dividends and share repurchase, we returned about 34% of net income last year. In terms of dividends, we grew that by 14% in 2015. And we also bought back 2.8 million shares for $210 million in 2015. You should expect to see trends around those two things remain pretty much the same in 2016. On M&A, as I mentioned before, we bought 3 companies last year for about $200 million - Novatima [ph], Alfa Valvole and CiDRA Precision Services. And in 2016, we anticipate significantly exceeding this level. And so we've got a great balance sheet, we have terrific cash flows and we have a very nice overall pipeline. So this will be an important part of our strategy here going into this year. With that, let's turn to the full-year results. I'm on slide 4. So, just as a reminder, these results exclude the impact of restructuring in both the full year and the fourth quarter and the gain of the sale of the Ismatec business that we had last year. In 2015, we had revenue of $2 billion. That was down 6%, down 4% organically. We also had orders of $2 billion which was down 5%, down 2% organically. Orders and sales, they continue to be soft in 2015, really pressured by the impacts I mentioned before - the oil and gas and the ag markets and really the slowing overall of North American industrial. The good-news story here was op margin is 21%, up 30 basis points year over year. And, again, I'm very, very proud of the team's focus on driving productivity and margin expansion even in a tough top-line environment. Free cash flow was a robust $322 million or 114% of net income. GAAP EPS for the year was $3.62 and adjusted EPS was $3.55. The 7% positive gain was really due to the restructuring actions and the gain of the sale of Ismatec. For the quarter orders and sales decreased 4% organically. Adjusted operating margin increased 40 basis points over the prior year to 21%. That was driven by strength in FMT and diversified which were up 40 and 280 basis points respectively. Free cash flow was strong at $88 million or 130% of net income. And for the full year and for the quarter, please keep in mind that we had a $2.6 million benefit or about $0.03 a share income tax, from the decrease in the Italian statutory rate in late December. So we ended up with $0.94 a share which was up 6% from prior year. Okay, let's turn to the segment discussion. I'm on slide 5. And as always, we will start with fluid metering. FMT closed out the year with a 1% increase in organic orders in Q4 and a 1% decline in organic orders for the full year. Sales were down 5% for the quarter and 2% for the full year. Op margin was up 40 basis points in the quarter, but down a modest 20 basis points to 24.6% for the year. And really very, very solid execution here for our energy business and driving productivity and continuing to keep very strong margins in the segment. In water services, the North American and the European markets were decent. Low single-digit growth and we expect that to play out again in 2016. And this is a place where we continue to see really great innovation driving those marketplaces and nice opportunities in 2016 and beyond. I have talked a lot about already the industrial markets. They were a significant headwind for FMT in 2015. Very low CapEx spending on projects really in the impact of oil and gas spending rippling through that marketplace. The top-line pressures, we expect them to continue, but they are flattening out. They are not going to further deteriorate in 2016 and we will continue to drive productivity and margin expansion in the segment. I'm very pleased with the performance of our recent acquisition, Alfa Valvole. The integration has gone well and we anticipate solid performance in 2016. In our energy business, there was some top-line softness really that impacted upstream oil and gas. But it was offset by nice efficiency gains and great margin expansion. In 2016, there are similar headwinds and we also have a little bit of a truck business in terms of our mobile meters, will be a little bit softer, but should be offset nicely by our aviation business. And finally, in ag, I have talked about this enough already, but we continue - we do believe it is going to be soft in 2016, but certainly do expect a bottom in this year. All right. Let me move to health and science. I'm on slide 6. So, the overall results in the quarter for health and science were really driven by a strength in life science markets, offset by weakness in the industrial. And there was a little bit of a poor mix impact here. So, that was the story for the fourth quarter, but also for the year. So, strong life sciences and scientific and weaker on the industrial side. In the fourth quarter orders were down 6% and sales were down 2% and for the year HST had a 2% decline in orders and a 1% decline in sales. Margins decreased 60 basis point in the quarter, but they were up nicely 80 basis points for the year. Scientific fluidics, the overall market place here is strong and we expect to continue in 2016. End-market demand, whether it is analytical instrumentation, bio or IVD, all remain nicely positive. And, again, we've got really nice positioning and innovation in this segment of our market. Sealing solutions, it is really a tale of two sides. One is the oil and gas business which has been soft; and the other which is their penetration into the semiconductor market which has been good. This certainly has been a negative mix, where we're more profitable on the oil and gas side than we're in semi, so that has played itself out a bit. And really, the trends here that we talked about remain the same relative to our expectations in 2016. You know, a tough industrial market, but an improving landscape on the scientific side. Optics and photonics were stable in the quarter. End markets in terms of industrial and laser optics were weaker, offset by strength in life sciences. Profitability has been a good news story there in 2015 and should be again in 2016. HST industrial looks a lot like FMT. The stories are very, very similar. We have great positioning here. We've driven nice productivity, but we certainly are feeling the headwinds of the overall industrial landscape. Material process, globally large capital projects were really put on hold in 2015. And we don't expect a big rebound in 2016, although we do have nice targeted projects that we're working on in our ability to make our own luck here in this business. All right. I'm on our last segment, diversified. I'm on slide 7. Now remember, this segment has really had the biggest swings that we've seen from some large impacts of orders and sales here over the last year, really driven by our fire trailer sales and our large rescue order and then some softness on the BAND-IT side due to oil and gas. Organic orders were down 6% for the full year and we had a 10% decline in organic sales. Operating margins improved nicely in the fourth quarter, up 280 basis points; and for the year, up 120 basis points. So, another impressive result, although admittedly coming off a soft comp here in the fourth quarter 2014. Dispensing had excellent growth in 2015. The core markets in North America, Western Europe and India all had impressive growth in the year and we expect that to continue in 2016. Sales of our X-SMART product have been terrific and they are driving top-line and bottom-line improvement and the overall new product pipeline in dispensing is very robust. In terms of fire suppression, the markets in North America and the UK have had solid performance and we expect stability in 2016. The rest of the world remains pretty choppy. If you look at the emerging markets and the budget tightness across those emerging markets for fire, that is going to be tight and that also impacts rescue. So, in our rescue business, had a very strong North American sales from our eDRAULIC 2.0 and the launch of StrongArm. But, this is our most global business and has really been impacted the most by the tight budgets in emerging markets. And finally, BAND-IT. BAND-IT has been a profit engine for this Company, continues to be. The impact from oil and gas were tough for BAND-IT in the year, but they continue to have strength on the transportation business. And this is a business that we'll continue to invest in and grow aggressively over time. All right. I'm going to - two more slides here. We will talk about overall 2016 guidance and then a few points on the quarter. I'm on slide 8. So, for the year, we really expect organic growth to be down 1% to plus 1% and that is fundamentally a macro call looking at the markets that we play in. We would expect to outgrow - outgrow our markets, but we do expect there to be relative softness throughout 2016. If you look on both sides of this bracketing, down one to up one, it is about a $0.10 headwind to a $0.07 tailwind, depending upon which side of the ledger we end up on. In terms of FX, we're primarily impacted by fluctuations in the euro, the Canadian dollar and the pound. But we kind of put all of that into the mix, the impact in 2016 is much more modest than the impact was in 2015. This year, we expect about a $17 million impact at today's rate which is about a $0.03 headwind. We do expect the acquisitions of Novatima, Alfa and CiDRA to add nicely to the business. But remember, that will be offset to some degree by the sale of the Ismatec business. The net of this or the gross would have been up about $0.05, $0.055 in the year, but offsetting Ismatec gets to about $0.04 of positive impact and $21 million of sales for the year. In terms of tax rate, we expect that come in at about 28.5%. That will be up over this prior year because of the impact of the changes - the one-time changes in the Italian statutory rate that we have the benefits of. So this will be about a $0.03 headwind versus 2015. We will continue our share buyback program. We expect to repurchase about 2% of our shares for the year and so that will add about $0.07 in 2016. And the impact of our restructuring gets us about $0.10 of benefit in 2016. Our productivity will fully offset our wage and material inflation to about a $0.03 benefit. But as I mentioned before, we're going to continue to invest. So even in difficult times, we need to make the call and continue to invest in growth opportunities and we're going to do that again this year. And so that can be up to a $0.10 impact for the year. All right. I'm on slide 9, our final slide. Let me talk about Q1 and a few more items around the full-year guidance. For Q1, we're estimating $0.80 to $0.82, with operating margins of approximately 20%. The Q1 tax rate will be 29% and we estimate that to be about a 1% top-line sales impact from FX. All right, a couple more items for you for the full year. For the full-year revenue growth, as I mentioned, we expect negative 1% to positive 1% organic growth and full year operating margin to exceed 21%. Top-line FX impact is about 1%, as I mentioned before, $0.03 of pressure. Full-year CapEx will be about $50 million. Free cash flow will be another strong year, 120% of net income. And once again, we expect to repurchase about 2% of our shares. As always, please remember that any of the guidance excludes the impact of M&A or the costs and charges associated with acquisitions. So with that, Tim, let me stop here and turn it over to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Mike Halloran of Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Mike Halloran : Let's start with the guidance. Could you just talk a little bit about how you think the cadence runs through the year Andy? It feels like it might be slightly back-half loaded. Maybe you could just talk about what your underlying assumptions are for improvement in the environment as you work for the year versus comps versus what you see in your order pipeline, things like that. Andy Silvernail : Sure. Well, first of all, at your conference last year we talked a lot about the realities of the first half of the year. And I think, if I recall saying, we said think the year is going to be negative 2% to plus 2%. And so as we look at it today, we think the year is now negative 1% to plus 1%, so it has tightened a little bit. In terms of how it flows, we knew that the year the tougher comps were going to come into the first quarter. And also, the first quarter just has more general expenses than you see in other parts of the year and that is a pretty typical thing overall. We're not calling for a big second-half rebound, Mike. There is some modest rebound expected, but it is not huge. And so, we're mindful that we could go through all of 2016 with it being a tough year and that is our expectation. And you know, we typically go into these things more cautious than not. As we have said many, many times in the past, we're a business that can respond very rapidly on the upside. We don't need a lot of direct labor to increase - or to tackle the increasing order book. At the same time, our high-variable margins, we want to make sure that we don't have a cost structure that is too heavy going into more tough times. Heath, do you want to touch on that? Heath Mitts : Sure. Mike, as normal, the Q1 earnings is typically lower than the rest of the year on comparable sales, just because of some Q1-related expenses mainly around stock compensation and otherwise. So, that is not uncommon for us. There is some natural seasonality from Q1 to Q2. And then we just know where some projects line up in terms of certain elements of the business and the timing of those. So, as we put together the forecast for the year and our budgets for the year, that translated into this guidance. All of that was taken into consideration in terms going out with the lower Q1 relative to where we were confident that the rest of the quarters will come in alignment. Mike Halloran : And are you suggesting, then, that if you go to the negative 1% organic growth and compare that to the 1% at the high end, that the low end doesn't really assume any real fundamental improvement as you work through the year and the high end assumes some modest improvement in some of those stressed markets? Heath Mitts : I think that is a fair - I mean, obviously we touch a lot of different end markets with our diversified portfolio, but I think that is a fair assumption. Mike Halloran : And then on the acquisition side, obviously some more bullish comments there than you have made in the last couple years. Maybe talk about what gives you the confidence. What kind of things are you seeing in the pipeline? Are these opportunities that have just been gestating over time here that just feel like they are coming to the finish line? Is it that the market has gotten a little more conducive? Maybe just talk about that confidence factor. Heath Mitts : No real meaningful changes in the M&A market. I don't see anything that is materially different than it has been in the last 12 months or so. It really comes down to we've got pretty good visibility to what's in our pipeline. We have had a lot of irons in the fire and we feel good about where some things are moving. At the same time, things break. So, we have been to the altar many times, but we feel pretty darn good about where we stand right now. And we think that this will be a good year for M&A for us. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Allison Poliniak : Just Andy, curious - I know you just touched on the acquisitions, but trying to understand that pipeline a little bit more. You said there was no changes to the market. I mean, is there anything fundamentally that you've done differently over the past few years that maybe built that pipeline up with a little bit more quality-type deals for you? Andy Silvernail : Yes, Allison, two years ago - I can't remember if it was this call two years ago, but right around two years ago we talked about the fact that we were putting more resource across the Company toward M&A. And that has certainly been - that has certainly helped play out. And so, if you just kind of look at what came last year, $200 million, I think we will certainly beat the $200 million this year in capital deployment. I think it really comes down to where we're putting our time and our effort. And we're talking about things that look like us. These are acquisitions that are squarely down our - the middle of our strike zone. And so I think it is time, it's focus and it's some things just playing themselves to the pipeline. You guys know how this works. This is - I wish it were a science, but it is a mix between art and science and it is playing out pretty well right now. Allison Poliniak : And then, just touching on energy, obviously at $30 here for crude, it sort of sounds like energy is at least stabilized, obviously not getting better for you and the industrial sort of ripple effect. But if we see at sort of this low level, would you expect another step down in terms of some of that spending and constraints there? Andy Silvernail : I don't think so for us, just because knowing where we play in the different parts of the market, I think the thing that has been surprising to us and a lot of folks, I think is the overall ripple effect that we mentioned and you mentioned here just a second ago. It has played out across the industrial economy more than I think people had expected. But in terms of it being a further step down at the current rates, I don't think so. As we look at the projects that we work on, say, Toptech and Toptech has a pretty good view of kind of larger project use. As we look at BAND-IT which is the more upstream stuff, those things have been hit already. And you can kind of follow the activity that drives that. But as you know, the vast majority of our business is midstream. And so the only kind of incremental negative that I see for us and I think this is really unique to us, is in our liquid controls business. We touch a lot of mobile applications that are on trucks and that truck build is going to come down, we think, in 2016, but offset, I think, reasonably by where we sit in the aviation which - where we have a good share, but there is a lot of penetration to go. So net net, Allison, I think we're - at this level, I don't think it changes very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Steven Winoker : Can we just put a finer point on 1Q? Is the calculation roughly about negative 1.5% organic? Is that with the implied - that is sort of my math is sort of getting me that range. What are you guys suggesting? Heath Mitts : I would say you are in the ballpark. We're looking at low single-digit organic, but not significantly different on an absolute sales basis from where Q4 came in. Steven Winoker : Okay. And then when you say you are not assuming a second-half ramp, but clearly there must be some here, is there anything in that assumption base about something getting distinctly better during the year? Or is this just comp-based when you are running the comps through it that are getting you to that new range? Heath Mitts : Let me clarify for my comment earlier. We do have some seasonality in the business and certainly the uptick from Q1 to Q2 is quite normal in our business. And then, there is generally project activity that takes place, some of which is already booked in our backlog for the back half of the year over and above kind of what we say is the daily book and bill rate. So there is some sequential uptick. Albeit, no doubt on a year-over-year basis, the comps get a lot easier after we anniversary the first quarter. Andy Silvernail : That's right. Steven Winoker : Okay. And just so I'm clear in terms of the current exposure, if I kind of work across the whole portfolio and add up those things that are kind of being hit cyclically that you went through, so - and, please, I'm sure my numbers will be off here; I would love to be corrected. But industrial, I've got it at about 18% to 20% of the whole portfolio; energy, oil and gas, like, 11% to 15%; and ag, another 2%. Is it something like - that gets me about a third of the portfolio that is being hit right now. Where am I wrong? Andy Silvernail : I think be more general. Let's generalize it a little bit here. So if you - and then I will dive back in, Steve. So, about 30% of the portfolio is life sciences and municipal and about 70% is industrially based. And if you start to segment the industrially based pieces, the - certainly, you have got it about right on the energy which is 11% to 15%. That is a good number in there of the total portfolio. And the ag piece is bigger than that. The ag piece is kind of 4% or 5% of the overall business. And then you start to slice it down by chemical, by general industrial, et cetera, et cetera. That is a pretty good picture. So I think the pieces that are being hit hard, that have been hit hard, are exactly what you just talked about. But you also have the other pieces that are also kind of hitting the industrial landscape that are soft, too. So, that is why as I kind of look at it and I say what really ends up happening in 20 - this year is the strength in 2016 is life sciences and municipal offset some of the negative impact in the more industrial pieces you called out and getting us to that negative 1% to plus 1%. Steven Winoker : And then maybe just sneaking in one on that M&A orientation, as you are looking at that pipeline right now, is the category that these deals are in - first of all, are you able to go larger because of the dislocations in the market? And are you leaning toward any particular segment more so or any kind of characteristic in terms of cyclicality? Any guidance on that front would be helpful. Andy Silvernail : You bet. So, let me kind of take the back half of that question first which is if you look at our funnel, it is actually pretty well spread across the three segments which we're excited about. We have got stuff in all three segments that we're looking at and we can certainly see things breaking this year across the three. In terms of cyclicality, non-cyclical, we don't have a huge ambition to increase cyclicality a lot. We have done a lot over the last decade to moderate that. And so that strategy will continue generally. In terms of overall pricing in what you're seeing, certainly some of the industrial pricing is starting to come down. It is coming down a little bit; it's still not coming down a lot. Money is still cheap in a lot of places and there is still competition there. The scientific businesses certainly have more robust multiples than the industrial-based businesses. Did I capture everything for you, Steve? Steven Winoker : Everything except willingness to go larger on the acquisition themselves. Andy Silvernail : Okay. You know, our sweet spot has always been that kind of $30 million, $50 million to $250 million. That is our sweet spot. And the reality is there just aren't that many things that are north of $0.5 billion that fit into our strategy. That being said, there are some and we absolutely would be willing to, if we could - if we had a view of being able to create significant value. For us, we start and stop with the idea of are we going to create significant value for shareholders to take on incremental risk. We have got a great business here. And so we're not going to bring on foolish risk via M&A and dilute our portfolio. We would much rather be more thoughtful and make those kind of dead-center acquisitions. But there are a few things that are bigger than we would do, Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones of Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Nathan Jones : I'm going to beat the M&A horse a little bit more. If you think a little bit longer term than just how you are going to progress with M&A in 2016, you guys have done obviously a very good job over the last few years. FMT margins mid-20s, FST margins mid-20s, health and science margins up into the low 20s. When do you start thinking about potentially adding another leg to the portfolio where you can use the same kind of techniques you have over the last several years to drive margins from something that might start at a lower base to create value? Andy Silvernail : Well, I think, first of all, Nathan, we have a lot of room kind of squarely within the businesses that we have today and near-adjacencies. If I look at our businesses and say, could we double the size of IDEX organically plus acquisitions that are right in our dead-center and near-adjacent, absolutely we can do that. And so, I'm not going to say we would never add another leg, but it is not the first priority. There certainly are a lot of things we'd look at over time. We have analyzed a lot of industries and a lot of subsegments of industries. And there are some things that are very attractive that absolutely fit our business model and our operating capability. But, I don't feel the need to go jump out at those. There are some things that if they became available at reasonable prices that we would do, but they are not priority one. Nathan Jones : Okay, that is fair. And obviously lower risk if you are sticking to near-adjacencies. Andy Silvernail : Yes. Nathan Jones : You did mention significantly higher plan on spending and M&A. I kind of did some back-of-the-envelope math to get you to an upper end, maybe, of leverage range after dividends and $100 million of share repurchases that you implied. I'm getting, like, $500 million, $600 million of available capital in 2016. Is that somewhere in the ballpark of what you are thinking about, knowing that you can't predict timing? Heath Mitts : I think that is a fair number. I mean, we could probably stretch a little bit more than that in this environment, given where our balance sheet sits today. But you are talking about with the $100 million plus value, you're talking about a $750 million total deployment. I think that is probably fair without getting too uncomfortable. Andy Silvernail : Yes. Just to be clear, Nathan, that is our capacity, not necessarily our expectation. Heath Mitts : Correct. Nathan Jones : Do you have an expectation? Heath Mitts : Significantly above last year. Nathan Jones : I figured that is what I would get. If I could just slip one in on China, you said China is no doubt in an industrial recession. Can you give us a little bit more color about what your people on the ground are seeing over there and what your expectations for the progression of that recession is in China? Heath Mitts : Upwards of two years ago, we started having this conversation with you guys about the softness of what we saw on the ground compared to what was being said everywhere. And the real issue is overcapacity, overbuilding. So if you look at almost any industrial sector in the Chinese economy, there is overcapacity in one way or another and they are going to have to grow into that capacity. And so I think 2016 is going to look a lot like 2015 for China. But at the same time, we're taking a longer view there. We - China is not an easy place to do business, but it is a place that we make a lot of money and long term is a place that we want to be. So we're going to continue to invest. But we and everybody else are going to have to work through the overcapacity issues over the next 12, 24 months. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt McConnell of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Matt McConnell : Andy, just to follow-up on your answer to an earlier question, you said you had M&A opportunities in all three segments. I know fire safety and diversified, you have such high share; it has not really been an M&A focus. Is it somewhere where you will see opportunities in adjacencies? Or what would be the M&A focus there? Andy Silvernail : You know, there are some really nice adjacencies in diversified. And if I look at the fire business, if I look at BAND-IT, we actually have put more resource around some of those areas in the last 12, 18 months and uncovered some really nice adjacencies that have the same kind of fundamental economics and leverage our strengths. And so, we would stay very close to home; there is no doubt about it. But there are some things that are out there that are pretty nice. Matt McConnell : And then on the growth priorities for 2016, you are investing $0.03 to $0.10. So, what are you prioritizing there? And maybe what have you had to scale back, just reflecting that we're in the second year of a pretty tough environment, down organic revenues this year? What are some of the priorities that you would want to highlight? And maybe, what is - how do you get trimmed back a little bit? Andy Silvernail : Matt, let me kind of answer that first by - from a high-level perspective and then come down to more specifics. As you know, our business model really relies on very, very aggressive segmentation. We're continually segmenting and re-segmenting around customers or products and markets where we think the profit pools exist. And so if you look over the last couple of years and you actually look at what we've done, we have moved our revenue to higher-margin profit pools and we've taken out structural costs that are really unnecessary to continue to move that margin, drive the returns and move growth in the places that we think are valuable. And then, frankly, we have taken out - probably in the last two years, we have probably walked away from, I don't know, $40 million, $50 million of revenue. Is that a fair number? Heath Mitts : I think, yes, over the last two years, the number is around $50 million that we have walked away from. Andy Silvernail : Yes, we're actively paring it, but we don't think we have differentiation and we don't think we have a long term strategic advantage. And we can move those resources. So, that is just part of what we do year in and year out and we will do it again this year. This year, we will probably pare back a percent of revenue, if you look at what we'll actually take out of the business that we think is nonproductive revenue and move those resources to other places. So, where are we moving it? It is really - we're really moving our resources all around our franchises. If I look at the franchises that we have in IDEX, we have a positive displacement pump franchise around biking and around [indiscernible] that is outstanding. I mean, really, really outstanding. Those two businesses are dang near 15% of total revenue, more than that if it's a percentage of total profits. We're going to continue to invest in there, even though their markets are a little bit rough right now. But if you look at the three or four new products that are going to get launched this year and next year under those franchises, they are going to be a big deal. And also certainly market development around both of those pieces of that franchise. We also have a terrific franchise around scientific fluidics and the optical components that match that. So, the optical fluidic engine that we talked about for a long time. We're making some pretty good-sized, long term bets in that franchise that, frankly, we're not going to see anything from for two or three years that - but we see where the market is going and we see some big, big upside moves here where it is going to take market and product development. So, we're certainly putting some resource there around that business. Our energy franchise, if you look at liquid control, that brand in particular, that is an absolutely terrific brand. We continue to invest there, even in the face of the downturn, because we see the data loop going in a major way. It's moving from hardware and basic software to a data loop and we need to be able to close that data loop to continue to grow that business. We're investing there. And then, we're making some pretty big bets in India and in China. So, in India, we have - as we have built a number of new facilities since 2011, we now - we have built 2 facilities since 2011. We have grown that business very aggressively and we have a position where we're a local player in the market, where we built a terrific business and can grow it pretty fast. And then in China, as we mentioned before, when things are difficult, this is when you can actually make some investments that are at a much bigger discount then you could have three years ago. But I think 10 years from now, is the Chinese market going to be more important for IDEX or less important for IDEX? It is going to be more important. So we need to make those investments there. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Charlie Brady of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question. Charlie Brady : Can we focus on dispensing for a second? It sounds like the growth was pretty solid there. Can you just give a little more granularity on the parts of that business where you are seeing that growth beyond just the broad geographical statements? Andy Silvernail : Sure, you that. It's actually - there is strength in three specific things and two are market related, one is product related. So, on the market side, as you know, over the last four or five years, the competitive dynamic in the U.S. market has - we have really positioned ourselves extremely well. And as the business - the overall business has come back over the last two or three years, our share position has grown meaningfully. And not just big boxes, right? Everyone kind of focuses on big boxes, but there are a lot of other outlets that are very important to the marketplace. And through new product development and having things that are better overall price positioning for that middle market, we have done well there and we have continued to take share in the big-box arena. Western Europe, this is a more - I apologize, this is just more of a general statement. The market improvement in Western Europe, we have taken advantage of that. And then finally, X-SMART. X-SMART, as you know, we launched out of India. We developed and launched out of India. It has certainly exceeded our expectations over the last few years and it is a product that is going to move its way into the advanced markets; there is no doubt about it. And we're going to launch here later this year. As you know, the X-SMART was kind of a lower price point, very high-capability automatic dispenser that really created a market. The market was manual and now we have a product that has really brought the automatic capability into that manual And we're going to launch a mid-tier product here in - later this year that we think is going to be just as exciting. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bhupender Bohra of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Bhupender Bohra : I believe you spoke about first quarter being weak on the core sales. How should we think about margins? I believe you gave guidance of 20% - I believe it is 21% plus. How should we think about in terms of looking at the productivity, pricing, of the quarters? Is it like first-half or the second-half heavy kind of thing? Thanks. Heath Mitts : Our pricing continues to be very IDEX-like in nature in terms of getting roughly, on a gross basis, about a point of price. Most of our price increases across the businesses go out in the late fall or early Q1. So we get a pretty good sense of what's going to stick on that by the time that we provide this guidance. And that is consistent with where we sit today. So, there's no doubt that benefits us. In terms of the productivity, as you noticed, as you probably noted on the bridge, that has been a good story. The teams have done an excellent job of being able to offset inflationary concerns. Most of our inflation comes via the labor inflation across the board. We have been able to hold off on a lot of material input. Inflationary pressures and the productivity initiatives that will run through the P&L are both a combination of carryover activities that we get the full your benefit from in 2016, as well as new initiatives that are continuously underway. So, we feel pretty good about our ability to, even in a flat organic growth environment, with the current construct of the portfolio, to be able to hold and expand overall operating margins. Bhupender Bohra : And the other question I had on the orders, if you can just give us some color how do you - are you seeing orders in the first January basically? And how do you exit December? Heath Mitts : Well, December is always a full-year push with the holidays and everything else. No different than any other year. We ended the year in, I would say, fine fashion. It is never as good as you quite want it to be and January is off to a reasonable start. But there is no doubt that, just as the color that Andy has provided throughout this call, there are certain end markets that are more pressured than others. And the areas that we think are going to be a little bit more robust around municipal and some of the things that are around life sciences, those areas have continued to be aligned with our guidance and continue to be a little bit stronger. So, this is going to be - when you are sitting at flat organic revenue growth, it is a bit of a slugfest throughout the year and we continue to operate in that mode, knowing that we've got to get more aggressive with productivity and in other areas where we can control our own destiny, knowing that the market support is going to be fairly volatile throughout the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Radigan of KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. Joe Radigan : A couple questions on HST. It sounds like scientific fluidics is okay. How are channel inventories there? Because in the past, that has caused one- or two quarter pauses in growth every once in a while. And then, is it reasonable to assume sort of mid-single-digit industry growth there based on the content you have won? Or is this - I know you said you are making investments. Is that growth more long term, two or three years out? Heath Mitts : Specific to channel inventories, don't necessarily see anything today that has me particularly concerned. There are a bunch of product launches that happened in the first part of this year, meaning our customers are launching. Right? So we will keep a pretty close eye on that. In terms of the investment cycle that I mentioned before, we opted, coming out of our strategic planning cycle this year, to go longer on a particular product innovation that is - it is going to take two or three years to develop. And it is a longer bet than we have historically made in some areas. But if I look back at some of the bigger bets and bigger successes, that is where they have to - that is how they pay off and that is how you have to go about them. So, what we're looking at for 2016 and 2017 is much more around kind of our bread-and-butter product development and market development. And as you get into 2018 and 2019, we expect to see some of these bigger things come into play. Joe Radigan : Okay. And then do you expect any favorable impact from the budget agreements? Specifically, the NIH budget, I think, increased the largest, at least on percentage terms, in 10 or 12 years. The medical device tax, I think, was - at least there was a moratorium on it. Does that benefit you or is that not really that correlated to your business? Andy Silvernail : No, the medical device tax, we're not going to see any impact, I don't think, from there. On the NIH side, just as we said when the NIH budget got crimped here a few years ago, the dollars themselves and how those dollars are spent are really actually not that big. But what they do is they really ripple through the industry and they start to drive innovation to the industry. So, when you are talking about an NIH budget that is - what is it, $35 billion, $36 billion, somewhere in that range, relative to the size of the life science industry, that is pretty small. But it does certainly drive innovation and there is a ripple effect. So the net of it is, it certainly is good news. But we don't get impacted by it really directly. It is more indirect and it will take a little bit of time. Joe Radigan : Okay. And then lastly Andy, can you just elaborate a little bit more on what you are seeing at BAND-IT outside of energy in terms of daily order rate? Have they weakened through the end of the year, early this year? Or, just what you are seeing there. Andy Silvernail : It is pretty flat. It is pretty flat generally. I would say that the transportation side continues to be good. As you know, we got on a whole series of product launches here a few years ago and that is playing itself out nicely. And we have some nice opportunities, too, to get on some new business. But what I will call the general industrial stuff, the stuff that we look at as the canary in the coal mine, pretty flat. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg of Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Brian Konigsberg : Just coming back to the commentary on price and cost, I guess maybe I just don't quite understand the bridge that you are coming to with the $0.03. So if you're saying you get a point of price, materials are - the input prices should be coming down, you are saying kind of flattish. Productivity is offsetting bureaucratic inflation. Why wouldn't price fall through at a much more meaningful rate? If you just want a point of price, that is kind of like almost $.20, not $0.03. Heath Mitts : Let me just clarify. On our bridge, prices is part of what we look at in terms of organic volume as well. So, when we're looking at the productivity side of things, we go into any given year with somewhere between $20 million to $25 million of inflationary pressures, two-thirds of which is labor costs, labor inflation. So, when we're looking at productivity initiatives, we're really looking at how do we offset those inflationary pressures. And then price, to your point, would then fall through. But that is embedded as part of our organic calculation. Brian Konigsberg : But you are saying productivity should effectively offset that $20 million to $25 million of inflation? Heath Mitts : Correct. Andy Silvernail : Of wage and material. Heath Mitts : Wage, material and burden inflation. Brian Konigsberg : Right, so what is left is just price. I mean, just in the bridge. Andy Silvernail : No, no, I think you are missing what Heath is saying. If you go to the organic count which is that first line item of negative 10% to plus 7%, price is going to be in that side of the organic calculation. Heath Mitts : Correct. Brian Konigsberg : Okay, understood. And then just on the restructuring, the $10 million, can you just talk about how that flows through by segment? And, to the extent you see incremental weakness in 2016, that is there obvious places to address if the downside scenario does take place? Andy Silvernail : Certainly. We got fairly aggressive in the back half of 2015 to the numbers that we have noted here and about the $12 million that is the 2016 impact. Obviously, we received a little bit of benefit towards the latter half of 2015 as well. But the $12 million which is about $0.10 a share, is the 2016 impact from those completed actions. I would say we're a lot - we're ready if the market ticks down. There are also - some of that is just going to be volume-based cuts that we made along those lines. We're also, at any given time, in good times or bad, have a handful of smaller facility consolidation-type activities that generally take anywhere from six to 18 months to complete, depending upon how complicated it is. And we would be doing those anyway. And you can expect in 2016 that that is happening. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jim Giannakouros of Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. Jim Giannakouros : Sorry if I didn't get this, but outside of M&A which the conversation has been exhausted which timing and magnitude of spend often comes to you or is determined by outside forces a bit, how should we be thinking about your view of flexing up or down that internal growth spend that you guided to $0.03 to $0.10 headwind in EPS? Meaning, are there some projects that are in the maybe column and not necessarily in your 2016 plans? Or, it is all a go and that variability between the $0.03 and $0.10 really has to do with top-line implications and the related leverage? Andy Silvernail : Yes, Jim, some of this spent and running. And then some of it, if we saw the world deteriorate, we could hold back on. And those are things that are headcount related that haven't been committed yet. So, we do have some flexibility on that, but generally, if the markets hold up, we absolutely want to make those. And we don't want to delay that spend. But we have some flexibility. Jim Giannakouros : And, again, if M&A doesn't map as you think it will in 2016, what is the priority ranking between the other uses of cash? Internal investments is up there. Like you said, you maybe get it more aggressive when others received. Or should we be thinking that you get more aggressive on share buybacks would be the number two? Andy Silvernail : Yes, I think from an organic growth and a dividend perspective, those are pretty dialed in. So, I don't see anything right now that would say to me, go take a large chunk of the rest of the free cash flow and balance sheet capacity to go do that. I think we're very dialed in there. It really would be around looking at where we trade relative to intrinsic value. And as we have talked about in the past, we have got a pretty robust process of how we think about share repurchase. So we put the work into estimating what we think the Company is worth. And when the Company is trading at an increasing discount to that, we will increase our share repurchase. But that being said, strategic M&A is absolutely the first thing we want to do with the excess cash. That improves our positioning. It allows us to compound capital over time and grow the business. But, in the absence of that, if we're at a discount to intrinsic value, you should expect to see us ramp up share repurchase. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Walter Liptak of Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question. Walter Liptak : I wanted to ask about your midstream business and - which is really more like downstream, because you are taking out - pumps and meters, I guess, as they are going from refiners to retailers, if I'm not mistaken. But I wondered about your comments on low project CapEx. And this the case of - kind of like the majors or the oil companies throwing out the baby with the bath water and cutting those downstream CapEx projects. Andy Silvernail : Yes, I think, Walt, what you are seeing is that ripple effect of what would have been [indiscernible] CapEx cut upstream and how that has filtered itself through the rest of the value stream. And so, you are seeing it play itself out. That being said, with the decrease in price - and if we see an increase in demand at all, that will drive that cycle the other way. It will drive the infrastructure cycle around distribution the other way. But right now, we're certainly seeing it in the short term the negative ripple effects of people being very careful with capital. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville of Alembic Global Advisors. Please proceed with your question. Matt Summerville : Just a couple quick ones. With respect to SSD orders down 10%, you look at revenue coming in at $98 million orders $97 million, those are sort of the lowest numbers since some time in, like, 2011 as I recollect. And I know there have been comps and lumpiness along the way. But if sort of the dispensing piece - which is maybe 25%, 30% of the segment - is doing good, as you talk about, just how bad are the other pieces? Andy Silvernail : Well, BAND-IT and rescue have both been hit by the forces that we have talked about. And we had the very large trailer order of fire. So the base business of fire is actually up kind of single digits, low to mid-single digits. But we had that really large bulk of business over an 18-month period of time of trailers that is much smaller now. And I can't remember exactly how large it was, but I want to say that was a $20 million chunk of business at one point. Heath Mitts : At one point. It has normalize for sure. Andy Silvernail : Yes. So, really, it is really rescue and BAND-IT on a - if I kind of look at kind of their base business that have been hit by this, with dispensing doing well and then the trailer business that is gone, but the base business of fire - not gone, but smaller. But the base business of fire is doing well. Matt Summerville : And then with respect to just the orders in HST, if you can parse kind of the life sciences pieces of the business and then what we can just called the general industrial pieces of the business, how would you characterize incoming order rates in those two groups versus the minus 6% that you reported? Andy Silvernail : The industrial-facing side has been more challenged. The sealing side that has oil and gas exposure has gotten whacked. MBT, just in terms of the project business, has been soft. Those are kind of - and then I would say the micro pump gas which is the other parts of - that I would put in industrial, look a lot like FMT with strength in life science. Matt Summerville : Great. And then just - I guess one more follow-up. As you look at the general industrial pieces of your business, whether it be FMT, whether it be an HST or some of the things that BAND-IT touches, do you get the sense that your customers in distribution are done adjusting their inventory levels? Did that get, quote, sort of cleaned up in the latter part of 2015 or are you seeing that continue into early 2016, thus adding to - it is somewhat of a - I will call it a little bit of a cautious view overall? Andy Silvernail : Yes, I said in the last couple of calls, this question about destocking has come up. And what I have said, I still hold to which is we don't have as much exposure to what I will call commodity distributors. We're much more playing with value-added distributors, carry much less overall safety stock. So, for us anyway, the issue has been end-market demand and it plays itself pretty rapidly through distribution. That being said, we have seen this many times. In these types of environments, everyone does get tighter around inventory. And if you see an uptick, you will see both a demand uptick and, for us anyway, I will call it a modest restocking uptick. But it's not big for us like it is for a lot of the folks who sell into the more commodity-like industrial distribution. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano of Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. Joe Giordano : I guess more of a conceptual question. When I think about your China business and I talk about being in an industrial recession there, how do you think about your business over the next decade there? And then trying to maybe - do you try to adapt your exposures to that market as they tried to adapt their markets to be more consumer-oriented? Andy Silvernail : Well, I think for us, what you'll see in China - the strength that we've had in China in the last decade has really been driven by industrial development in the mega-city centers. Right? So as all kinds of things have been built and all the structure that goes around that, our FMT products, some of our diversified products, that is kind of where that follows. As you get to more modernization - and I'm going to put modernization into two categories. One is going to be the continued buildout of cities that aren't these mega-city centers. But where population is going to continue to move, is going to continue to urbanize, you're going to see a similar type wave there that I think we will benefit from. So what that really means is we have got to make sure that we're moving our sales and applications, engineering resources to those parts of the country that are going to see the kind of growth where people are going to be. So that is one. The second one, as you see the rest of the country modernize, that is where parts of our HST portfolio and our diversified portfolio start to have strength. So, think about, as medicine becomes more and more important, certainly and testing is more readily available, you're going to see our life science business do well there. You are going to see our material process do well there. You're going to see our optics business do well in that world. And you are also going to see parts of our rescue business do well. So think about fire, think about rescue as you start to see other parts of the country modernize and industrialize. So, it is a nice lifecycle to our portfolio. And over the next decade, I think it is going to be an important thing for IDEX. Joe Giordano : Yes, I think HST was really what I was getting at. What would you say - think the contribution is from that? In HST, what is China in HST right now? I'm assuming on the life science - part of HST, it is pretty small. Yes. Andy Silvernail : It is small and it is principally serviced out of the U.S. and Europe, with the sales office in Asia. We're pretty careful around IP and so we have been careful around there. But I do see that growing as a proportion meaningfully over the next decade. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jim Foung of Gabelli & Co. Please proceed with your question. Jim Foung : So, let me just ask one question. If oil prices start to rebound from these levels and they start pumping again, how quickly would you benefit from that? Andy Silvernail : I would say it would look a lot like the negative impact that we had it in terms of timing and the upside. Again, we don't have a ton of exposure downhole. And so you've got that kind of 3% or so of our business that really does have that, that would get impacted pretty quickly. So when CapEx spending started getting whacked here last year, that 3% went to 2% pretty quickly. And so I think you would see that come back relatively quickly. But as it played itself through the rest of our business, it would be more of a slow roll, just like it has been a relatively slow roll in the negative side. Jim Foung : So you would see like maybe six months kind of a timeframe where you would start feeling some impact? Andy Silvernail : I think that is fair, Jim. But you have got to realize that just getting - the fracking rigs would come on quickly because you have the capacity to do that. But remember, a lot of the capacity that - the fracking stuff came off-line really quickly. The stuff that is coming off-line now is more the offshore stuff that is a heck of a lot harder to get up and going. So, that timeframe - six months is maybe a little too short. Maybe it is six months to a year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones of Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Nathan Jones : Just a very high-level question. You have guided to flat organic growth for the year. Can you break that down between what you think the markets are going to grow and what you think you are going to outgrow the markets? Andy Silvernail : At what level of specificity are you looking for, here, Nathan? I'm not sure I understand your question. Nathan Jones : As specific as you can get. I mean, the overall guidance for the Company is flat organic growth, minus 1% to plus 1%. When you built up that forecast, what was market growth? Was it minus 2% to zero and you are going to outgrow it by a point? Or - Andy Silvernail : Okay, I got you. That is exactly right. I think our growth rate relative to the market is - we will beat it by a point. So if you look at the overall market growth, we're building our models are somewhere between one and 2 points. So if we're at plus 1%, the markets are a negative 1%. If we're at negative 1%, the markets are probably down 3%. Operator : There are no further questions in the audio portion of the conference. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Andy Silvernail for closing remarks. Andy Silvernail : Well, thank you all very much for joining us. I appreciate it. We're all dealing with the realities of the tough industrial world. At the same time, when I look at IDEX and I look at the strength of IDEX and how we hold up in this market place, I think we have done a very, very nice job. And I want to congratulate our teams for operationally delivering from a capital deployment perspective, doing the right things and really investing in the long term of IDEX. So, look forward to talking to you all again here in 90 days. I appreciate your time. Take care. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation and you may disconnect your lines at this time.",

As we begin, a brief reminder. This call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the Safe Harbor language in today's press release and in IDEX's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Andy Silvernail. Andrew Silvernail : Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everybody, and I appreciate you joining us here for the discussion of our first quarter results. As Mike said, I'm going to walk through some overview comments and also some conversation around capital deployment, and then we'll get into the financials and the segment results. So from a big picture, as we sit here after the end of the first quarter, it looks an awful lot like as we talked about from the end of 2015. The overall economic picture is mixed. As I look at the landscape in the industrial markets, whether it's in the U.S. or Europe or Asia, are relatively weak. That's being offset in many regards by strength in our Health & Science businesses, municipal is also strong, and we've had very good execution. I'm going to take you through more detail when I walk through the markets and the segments, but I think it's suffice to say that the challenges that we talked about at the end of the year are still very much the same picture that we have after the first quarter. With that, I'm very pleased with how we started the year, given the markets, really because of the overall execution by our teams in the field. The first quarter \u2013 when I look at the first quarter, I think about the benefits that our shareholders get by IDEX having diversity in end markets and businesses and allow us, in these questionable economic times, to still drive profitable growth. And we saw that with the strength in our Health & Science business that still saw growth, even though there are some challenges on the industrial parts of the markets. And I'm very happy with our teams focusing on what they can control. Starting in the midpoint of last year, we put a lot more emphasis on overdriving productivity, making sure our cost structures are in place, while, at the same time, continuing to invest in the long-term growth that really differentiates IDEX over time. And the teams did a good job. If you look at the first quarter, EPS was $0.89. That was up $0.05 or 6% from a year ago. Op margin came in at 20.4%, which was 10 basis points ahead of a year ago. And free cash flow is very strong at $62 million, up 45% versus a year ago. We also completed the acquisition of Akron Brass. It fits very well into our fire and rescue platform. It really fits all the dynamics of what we refer to as an IDEX-like business. It fits our operating model, it addresses mission-critical solutions with highly engineered products, and it really faces a niche market that we have excellent positioning in. So, we're thrilled to have Akron as part of the IDEX family. Additionally, as you look at the first quarter, our healthy balance sheet and strong cash flow has allowed us to continue to drive capital deployment decisions. We increased our dividend by 6%, and we bought back 628,000 shares for about $46 million, so a favorable price, sitting at just under $73 a share. So, while we look at this lack of underlying economic demand and the challenges that it continues to create, we know that the growth is going to be hard to come by. But we have a philosophy and a discipline of how we run these businesses and that remains intact and very solid. And we continue to expect to win this year and continue to drive value for shareholders throughout 2016. I want to take a minute here and just walk through what we're seeing in our core markets and geographies. In terms of markets, I'll start with energy and chemical. We've been touching on this for the last 18 months. The weakness that we've seen, specifically, around the energy businesses and the weakness in these markets have hit our energy platform BAND-IT and Sealing Solutions meaningfully as we've talked about in the past. We're also seeing kind of the residual impacts of hit to Warren Rupp, Viking and Richter, all important businesses for IDEX, and they do touch, in one way or another, the implications from the energy slowdown. Now, this is being mitigated to a large degree by where we sit in the energy food chain so to speak. We don't really touch the wellhead. We're not involved deeply in E&P. And so where we sit in midstream and downstream has had a significantly lighter impact overall, not nearly as deeply cyclical. And so we've held up better than a lot of folks who are much further upstream. If you look at the industrial segment, where we sit, we've really seen a steadying sequentially. So, if you look at how we came in the third quarter, the fourth quarter and now first quarter, we have seen some consistency sequentially. Now, we did have tough comps here in the first quarter on the industrial side. So, that's driving some of the negatives that you're seeing. But we have seen this level off to some degree which is, I think, is a solid sign. Agricultural, everybody knows the story here. Overall commodity prices have been hit hard and they are expected to remain that way throughout the balance of the year. The hit to farmers' wallet has really slowed OEM demand, and we expect it to be that way for the balance of the year. It is somewhat offset by the strength in the aftermarket, but not enough at the magnitude that we're seeing OEM equipment sales come off. The opposite of that is Scientific Fluidics and, really, the life sciences markets in general, which have been strong across the end markets, whether you're looking at Bio, Analytical Instrumentation or IVD. Those were all strong in the first quarter, and they will be for the balance of this year. The same can be said to in municipal. We've had consistent low-single digit growth across North America and Europe. Municipalities are investing in areas that IDEX touches, and so that's been a solid story for us, and we expect it will be also for the balance of the year. If you turn now to regions, and we look at North America, Europe and Asia, in North America, the story is largely industrial, meaning if you look at where the weakness is, it really comes from industrial distribution, the residual impacts of what's happened in the energy markets and the fact that we really are sitting at historic low inventory levels within our distribution channels. In Europe, it's been quite stable. We feel very good about our positioning within Europe for today and in the balance of 2016. We have nice exposure across a number of businesses, specifically, in dispensing and water. They have really outpaced the market growth in Europe, and we expect them to do so here for the balance of the year. In Asia, it's really two different stories. One is China that has been consistently weak; not a new story that we've been talking about. We've been talking about this now for well over a year, and we expect those headwinds to continue. On the other hand, if you look at India, India has been a great story for us. We're seeing \u2013 we're really taking advantage of the infrastructure improvements and the expansion both within the country and our accelerated investments, and that's playing out in many regards in our fire, rescue, dispensing and also in our energy business. So India has been a good news story for us. With that, let me touch on capital deployment for a minute. As we've talked about in the past, we really have a four-pronged strategy around capital deployment, and we've been very focused on continuing to invest in our strategy of long-term organic growth, number one, disciplined M&A, consistent dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. And what I want to do is just take a minute and I'll talk about each of these areas. So on organic growth, we keep investing for the long term. We've got the capacity to make these investments that drive profitable growth for many years to come. And we all see businesses that, when they face challenging times, start to cut the things that are easy. And oftentimes, the things that are easy to cut are the things that you really need for long-term investment. We're fortunate that we've got the cash flow, the balance sheet that we can continue to really invest in the long term, and this is going to payoff for IDEX and differentiate us over time. If we look at dividends, you saw on April 6 that our Board of Directors approved an increase of 6% in our dividend, and we're now paying $0.34 a share per quarter. In share repurchases, I mentioned a moment ago, we repurchased 628,000 shares in the quarter for $46 million at just under $73 a share. And going forward, we're going to continue to be opportunistic. We've talked about this a lot in the past. We have a very disciplined and thoughtful process of when and how aggressively we buy back stock, and we'll continue to have that discipline as we go forward. On the M&A front, as I've mentioned, we bought Akron Brass. We spent $224 million for Akron. They had, in 2015, about $120 million of revenue. It's really an excellent strategic fit. We are in the integration process now, and over the first 30 days, it's gone very well. So we're pleased with asset that we have in Akron and the team there. We're thrilled to have them as part of the IDEX family. If you look into the future of M&A, the market, the dynamics remain pretty similar to what we talked about at the end of 2015. We're going to continue to be a player in the marketplace. We've got a good funnel, and we've got the cash flows and the balance sheet that will really allow us to continue to deploy capital for M&A. All right. With that, let me switch over here and let's start talking about the quarterly results. I'm on slide four. So, in the first quarter, we had revenues that were $503 million. That was flat in total, down 3% organically. We had orders of $526 million that were also flat and down 3% organically. But, very importantly, we built $23 million of backlog in the quarter, and that puts us in an excellent position as we think about going into the second quarter, giving us visibility into the second quarter. And also, as we think about the step-up from Q1 to Q2 and then really how the rest of the year flows through, having that $23 million of backlog is a good place to start from. In terms of organic orders and sales, they were continued to be pressured, as I've said, by energy and ag markets. We don't expect that to get meaningfully better as we look at the balance of the year. And also, there was one other part there that's a little bit of an interesting comparison and does put some noise into the numbers. And that's that last piece of the trailer business that we had in 2015, in the first quarter of 2015, that shift that we comped against. So, when you look at the FSD segment and you see some of the puts and takes in that segment and, specifically, around organic orders, that really explains the overall situation there \u2013 excuse me \u2013 organic sales, that explains the situation. Organic orders were quite good in FSD. Overall, for the company, we had a 20.4% op margin. That was up 10 basis points year-over-year. There are a lot of moving parts in that, and I'm going to go into that on the next slide here in a second. Overall, I'm very happy with how we've executed and how we're driving profitability and ultimately cash flow in the business. To that end, as I said, cash flow was $62 million in the quarter, up 45% from last year. We had GAAP earnings of $0.89, up $0.05 or 6% for the year. And with that, what I'd like to do is go to the next page, turn to slide five, and I want to just take a moment to bridge you from our reported $0.89 against the midpoint of our guidance as we're going into the quarter, which was $0.81. So if you'll flip to slide five, I'll just walk you through that bridge. So the midpoint of our Q1 guidance, as you recall, that we gave just a couple of months ago was $0.81 and we delivered $0.89 for the quarter. And so let me walk through the puts and takes here. So on an operating \u2013 in terms of operating results, we added $0.03 over our $0.81 guidance and that was really driven by very solid execution. If you look at the purchase of Akron Brass, the net of that for the quarter was actually negative $0.01. So, we owned Akron for just two weeks in March. So we got some operating benefits for owning them for the two weeks of March, but that was offset by $2.2 million or fair value inventory step-up. And so, the net of that was a negative $0.01. Also, we had a $0.03 reversal for contingent consideration for an acquisition from 2015 that really turned in $0.03 of benefit. I'd ask you to note though that this is handled in the corporate books. So it's not reflected in the segment results. And that will be important as we think about segment margins on an apples to apples basis, because of how some of these pieces are flowing and we'll make sure that we can bridge you guys, if you have any questions, to make sure that as you go forward your models are accurate. Finally, we chose to adopt early the accounting standard for share-based compensation. That gave us $0.03. I think you're all aware every U.S. company is going to have adopt that by the end of the first quarter of next year. We simply elected to adopt that early. So, all in all, when I look at it, it's a very strong start for us. Operationally, I think we had a solid first quarter. And certainly when we get to Q&A, if you've got questions on these puts and takes, we're happy to spend some time on it. All right. Let's turn to the segment discussions. I'm on slide six and I'll start with Fluid & Metering. So, in the first quarter, FMT orders and sales decreased by 6% and 5%, respectively, and operating margins were down 130 basis points. That was really driven by the lower volume in the energy and the ag businesses. We've talked a lot about what we've seen in industrial, energy and ag, which have been more challenged. The real good news story here is around water. We had another solid quarter, similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter. Municipal markets are solid in North America and Europe with single-digit growth. The mild winter also helped us some. When you think about the work that has to be done \u2013 specifically, when you think about the UK and the U.S., when you get a mild winter, you get projects that get pulled forward that would initially be scheduled for the spring or for the summer. So we did see a little bit of business come forward. But, more importantly, we've had terrific new product development and productivity out of that group that's driven the incremental benefits. As I've mentioned before on industrial, order rates in Viking and Warren Rupp, they do remain under pressure, although, sequentially, have stabilized. And that's really all about the demand levels in industrial distribution. I would not call it destocking. I just think it's the \u2013 what we've seen in industrial distribution is demand has been weak, they have appropriately taken down their inventory levels, and I think they're managing that well. We have talked about the drivers of this and it really is around the impacts of oil and gas. But I'll give our teams a lot of credit here. They've done a very, very nice job of getting their businesses right-sized, continuing to be highly profitable. These are businesses with very strong incremental margins on the upside and the downside, and they've done a nice job of getting in front of that. In our energy business, we did see a soft start to the mobile market. That's really driven by builds in Class 6 and Class 8 trucks, which has started to slow. It was offset a bit by aviation, which has been stronger and gotten the positive side of lower fuel prices and strong demand. And these guys are going to work through this. Again, much like I said in the industrial side, they've done a nice job of getting their cost structures in place and making sure they've got the appropriate business scope and size for the market. And then finally, just on ag, I've talked about that enough already, but that's going to look like it has for the balance of this year, and we're going to make sure that we're in fighting shape to compete. If you go to slide seven, on Health & Science, that's a much more positive tone across the business. Really, the life sciences and the scientific markets remain strong. The industrial businesses have stabilized quarter-over-quarter, which is good. We saw organic orders. We're down about 4%, but, as you know, in this market, and very specifically, in this segment, you can get some more puts and takes here quarter-to-quarter. Organic sales were up and op margin increased by 90 basis points. And that was really driven by overall volume leverage and nice productivity across the segment. As you get down into some details, Scientific Fluidics, orders and sales have continued to be strong. The markets are in a good spot. We are really well-positioned across Analytical Instrumentation, Bio and IVD, and we expect this to be a very solid marketplace for us through the balance of this year. Sealing Solutions is a mixed bag. The parts of that business that touch scientific markets, mostly semiconductor, have done very well. The parts that touch oil and gas and heavy equipment have taken a pounding. So, net-net, it's been a challenging year for Sealing Solutions Certainly, a good news piece of this is our Novotema business that we bought last year. It's integrated well. And they've been able to get on board and be part of IDEX and build a product portfolio and the operating practices that really help them be part of the IDEX core business. Optics & Photonics were stable in the quarter. Profitability improvement, once again, was very good. And these productivity improvements, over the past few years, they really take hold as you get any uptick in volume at all. And so, we're very pleased with the profitability levels and what they're demonstrating there. On the industrial side of HST, looks a lot more like FMT. So, they're still weak year-over-year, but we're seeing stability sequentially. And again, I think that's at least a solid story for us. Material process technology, this is the lumpiest of all of our businesses. Capital projects, really, on a global basis, have been challenged. Our team's done a nice job of focusing in places where we really have differentiated technology and capability, and we've had some nice wins in Asia around food and overall in the pharma markets. We do expect that we're going to see some weakness in North America. But, overall, we think Asia should balance that out. And we think MPT has the shot of having a pretty solid year throughout 2016. Okay. I'm on our final segment. I'm on Diversified on slide eight. So, as I mentioned to you before, there are some puts and takes, specifically, on the sale side because of comping up the last piece of that trailer order, but the net of it is organic orders were up 4% in the quarter, while organic sales were down 6%. Operating margins decreased to 120 basis points. But, overall, if you look at what happened with the step-up charge from Akron, if you exclude that, FSD operating margins actually increased 80 basis points. So, on the core operations, really nice performance. So, Akron, obviously, as it gets brought into the fold, it's a little bit muddled in terms of how things flow through the P&L and balance sheet, and we'll make sure that we're real clear with you again on an apples-to-apples basis. In terms of dispensing, really nice job; they continue to deliver for the company. They're winning across North America, Asia and Europe. X-Smart continues to be a very good story for us, and it's really turned into a high profit business that has terrific positioning for the global markets. So we think 2016 is going to continue to be strong for dispensing. Fire Suppression, we talked about the impact of trailers. But if you kind of neutralize for that, the core markets are stable in the U.S. and in the UK and had a nice solid first quarter. And again, having Akron as part of that team is going to be terrific. That positions us very, very well across the spectrum of those markets. Rescue; rescue has been soft, as we've talked about. It's continued to be that way. But we are expecting an uptick later in 2016. There are a number of large projects in Europe and Australia that have either been announced or they're in preparation, and we think we're well-positioned against those chunks of business. And those are some of the first larger chunks of business outside of the U.S. that we've seen here in sometime. And so we feel good about going after that business. And then really, finally on rescue, eDRAULIC 2.0 and our StrongArm, two products that we've talked about in the past, both are doing well in terms of growing in our core markets, really, specifically in North America, getting off to a nice start. But that market softness in other parts of the world is muting that. Finally, BAND-IT, BAND-IT has really been hit hard by the impacts of oil and gas and the industrial markets. But they've done a nice job in transportation. So, they've had to deal with the headwinds. They've dealt with it well. This is a great business for us, and it will continue to do so, and a great profit generator and one that will continue to \u2013 will return to growth here in the future. Okay. I'm on our final slide, and I want to take some time and just walk you through our second quarter and full year guidance. I'm on slide nine. All right, so let's talk about 2Q. In the second quarter, we're expecting EPS of $0.91 to $0.93. Importantly, this includes the remaining $5.4 million pre-tax inventory step-up charge for Akron or about $0.05. So, the way to think of it operationally is it would be $0.05 better than what we have on the sheet here. But we are going to run through the last of our inventory step-up for Akron here in the second quarter. Because of all that, you will have a lower operating margin for the quarter. So, again, that $5.4 million is about 1 point of operating margin, so its $0.20 reported 21% apples to apples. Organic revenue, we think will be flat in the quarter. And tax rate will be about 27.5%. If you look at the fiscal year, we are increasing our guidance. We were at $3.60 to $3.70. We're now at $3.70 to $3.75. And this is principally driven by the benefits associated with the new accounting rules for the share-based compensation that I talked about earlier. It's important to note that we're going to neutralize this year for the impact of Akron. So, the way to think of it is the first half charges that we're going to take relative to inventory step-up will be offset by the operating benefits you'll get in the second half of the year. But, for the full year, you really neutralize the EPS impact of Akron in total. Full year revenue, as we said in the last quarter, we expect to be flat with operating margins \u2013 organically expect to be flat with operating margins in the 20.5% to 21%. Again, we guided at about 21% earlier. The difference between what we're talking about now and the 21% earlier is 100% associated with Akron and bringing that in as part of the family. CapEx will be about $50 million. Free cash flow at 120% of net income. We'd ask you to model about a 2% net decrease in shares. Obviously, we had a great start to the year in that when the share price was depressed, and so we're asking you to model at approximately 2%. As always, any future guidance does not include the impact of acquisitions, either costs or the benefits. So, Rob, with that, I'm going to pause here, and why don't we turn it over for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt McConnell with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Matthew McConnell : Thank you. Good morning, guys. Andrew Silvernail : Good morning, Matt. Matthew McConnell : Could you discuss the visibility that you have to the flat organic growth this quarter? Because orders are still down and I know there's a comp issue with the trailers and, especially in FMT, your orders' down 50% on an organic basis this quarter. Can you just discuss how you bridge to flat sales next quarter? Andrew Silvernail : Yeah. So, if you kind of think about where we're ending the quarter in terms of backlog and what we usually go into a quarter with, typically, we have a total backlog that's about half the quarter, and we're kind of plus or minus that. We go into it thinking about what the first quarter versus second quarter with the amount of backlog that we have today and the fact that we built $23 million incrementally of backlog. And it gives us a lot of confidence that we'll get to that second quarter number, plus or minus. And so, I feel pretty good going in to the second quarter about where the top line will land. Because we are such a short-cycled business, you never know, as you know full well, Matt. But where we stand today with what I'll call stability on the industrial side and visibility relative to our current backlog and building backlog, it feels pretty good. Matthew McConnell : Okay. Great. And then, when you discuss the improvements in businesses like water and Scientific Fluidics, some of the parts that are doing better, is there a way that you can differentiate how your markets are doing versus \u2013 I know some of these are the pieces that you've been investing in through a fairly soft demand environment. Is there a way to split out how IDEX is doing versus the market in some of these areas that are going to grow in the back half? Andrew Silvernail : Yeah. I think, not as discretely as I'm sure you'd like, but we can obviously cut it by what we believe to be overall market growth and then the impact of our initiative, whether they'd be market penetration or new products. That's a lot easier to do when you're truly entering a brand new market, which we don't do very often. The new products is really the place where you can really put your finger on and you can see the acceleration. So, if you look at the water businesses, we got a series of new products that we've launched. You can look at those discretely. If you look at dispense, you look at StrongArm, or you look at the platforms that we know we're on in HST, you can get your arms around each of those in a pretty discrete way. The way I would say across the board is we are modestly taking share. I don't think its huge share, but if you look at our relative organic growth rates market by market, segment by segment against our competitors, we feel pretty good that we're holding up relative to how the markets are and modestly taking some share. Matthew McConnell : Okay. Great. Thank you. Andrew Silvernail : Thanks, Matt. Operator : Our next question is from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Nathan Jones : Good morning, everyone. Andrew Silvernail : Hi, Nathan. Nathan Jones : If we could just start on the reversal of the accrual for the earn-out. I think it looks like it was on the CIDRA acquisition. And I know you would've preferred to pay that money out, because it would mean that business was performing better. Can you talk about what caused it to miss those expectations for the earn-out? Andrew Silvernail : Yeah. So, that was an acquisition that we did that's a very important acquisition; small but important for HST, specifically, Scientific Fluidics. And we went into the acquisition with a very specific point of view of what we though the performance would be of that business. And our partners who are still engaged and excited about being part of IDEX and are doing a terrific job had a more aggressive point of view. And so, we agreed that we put a construct in place, and if they delivered over and above, meaningfully, over and above the base case that they would receive more consideration. And as always, when you do that, you put that on the balance sheet and, each quarter, you have to make an estimate. And so, as we sit here today, a part of that, we don't think they're going to get that, I'll call that accelerated growth on top of what we thought was already a nice chunk of growth in a good piece of business. And so, the accounting rules really dictate that. Yes, I would have loved \u2013 it would be terrific if they had hit their very aggressive case. But the base business is still doing quite well and very much in line with the model that we've put together. Nathan Jones : Okay. So, it's not out of line with where you thought it would be? Andrew Silvernail : No. No. And that \u2013 sometimes it happens, right? When you've got a buyer and a seller and you have points of view that are different. And this is a way to figure that out and it gives both real skins in the game around it and everybody knows what they're getting into, and that's just how it works out sometimes. Nathan Jones : Understood. So you did about minus 3% percent organic growth in the first quarter. You're forecasting flat the second quarter, which means to get to the midpoint of the full year guidance that was minus 1% to plus 1%, you need about 1.5% in the back half. Is there any assumption of improving markets in the back half? Because it doesn't really look like your revenue comps get that much easier as we go through the year. Andrew Silvernail : They do get a little bit easier. And Matt, when we're talking about 1.5 points, you're really talking about $10 million. Nathan Jones : Rounding errors. Andrew Silvernail : Yeah. These are real rounding errors. And so, there are some easier comps when you go to the third and the fourth quarter particularly. So, if you remember that the weakening last year really started the midway through the second quarter. And so, we still had a pretty decent second quarter overall last year, but we saw that weakening happening in kind of June. And so, the third and the fourth quarters were comparatively weaker. As I look kind of forward, the really important ramp for us was going to be where we're going to ramp from a weaker first quarter to a stronger second quarter. And that, for us, was really the telling sign. And given the backlog that we built and given some of the visibility that we have, unless you start to see something deteriorate meaningfully that we don't see today, we feel pretty good about where the top line should end up here for the balance of the year. Nathan Jones : Okay. And then just one more, I guess, more philosophically on the M&A front. You guys have done a great job over the last several years. Earned a premium multiple out there in the market. Are there properties out there that would interest you that would require the issuance of equity? Is that somewhere that you would be prepared to go? Would seem that there's an arbitrage there on your valuation at some point here? Can you just talk about how you think about using equity? Any such properties even out there that would big enough to require that for you? Andrew Silvernail : So, I think the answer to the first part of your question is yes, we would, but it would be very selectively. Even though we do have a premium valuation arbitrage, that equity is extremely valuable, and being able to use cash or debt tends to be a much better mechanism for us generally. And so, we'd really prefer to do that. But if the right thing were there and that was the requirement, yes, we would consider it. The reality is, and we talked about this a lot in the past, there just are very few things of the scope and size that would require us to do that. And there are some things out there. As we said in the past, there are some larger businesses that we think would be a great fit with IDEX and we believe could drive a huge amount of value, but there aren't very many. But if that rare circumstance were to happen, as one of our board members called it, the purple squirrel, if that was to happen, we don't find them very often, but would we do it? Sure, we'd do it. Nathan Jones : All right. Thanks very much. Andrew Silvernail : Thank you, Nathan. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Halloran with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Mike Halloran : Hey. Good morning, guys. Andrew Silvernail : Hey, Mike. Mike Halloran : So, first, just talking about the signs of stabilization you're seeing out there on the industrial side, is that on the order book? Is that in the customer conversations? Is it in what you're seeing just maybe more normal sequential starting to play out? Maybe just some color on what the contextual things you're seeing specifically that point to the stabilization side. Andrew Silvernail : Sure, Mike. We started to see this third quarter and the fourth quarter, right? So, as you saw third quarter, fourth quarter developing last year, you are still \u2013 if you went back, as I answered Nathan's question, if you went from kind of middle of the second quarter last year, through a good part of the fourth quarter last year, you were seeing sequential downticks, right? And you were seeing all of the behaviors that go along with that, right? And what we've seen now is that sequential stability, call it, for the last four months or five months, and also that \u2013 maybe I'll call it that sense of anxiety or panic that a lot of people have when you're seeing sequential downticks, you start to see that level off. So, yes, it's happening in conversations. It's happening in how people are setting their inventory Kanbans. And we're really principally talking about industrial distribution. And so I'm going to call it stability. Now, part of it is we don't have that big exposure or direct exposure to oil and gas. So places that do still have that you're still seeing lots of volatility. Even with oil creeping up here over the last few months, there's still a lot of volatility around that marketplace. And as you know, we're still in the midst of rig reductions. So we're not experts. We're certainly not experts in that part of the world, but the places that we do touch it, that still has a lot of volatility. But the base industrial business, both in terms of the numbers and how people are responding subjectively, feels like it's leveled off to a degree. Mike Halloran : Okay. That helps. And then kind of a modeling question. When you think about the on-boarding of Akron here, how does that change the seasonality on that FSD segment? Heath Mitts : Hey, Mike. It's Heath. Not a ton. Akron's activity doesn't have a tremendous amount of seasonality to it. Once we fully layer in the Akron numbers to our diversified segment, inclusive of all the ongoing intangible amortization and so forth, it will have an impact on operating margins down as we begin the journey to build up Akron's profitability closer to IDEX-like levels. But, in general, the order book for Akron doesn't have a tremendous amount of seasonality. Andrew Silvernail : So, what that will do, though, Mike, is because as we do \u2013 because you do have some volatility across that segment, just more than others, and you have some more seasonality because of dispensing, that will probably, to some degree, not huge, but to some degree, mute that a little bit, the whole segment. It will be a little bit more muted in terms of volatility, but not big numbers. Mike Halloran : That makes sense. And then on the HST side, anything new coming from a new product introduction side? Things you're working on with the core customers there that are going to be significant in the near term here? Andrew Silvernail : Nothing that's going to blow the doors off. But the stuff that we're going to launch here this year, next year, this is the stuff we've been working on. If you were to go back and look two years ago, we'd have told you that we're going to start to see some stuff coming out in late-2016, 2017 that are really attached to new products that our customers are going to launch. And we're in design cycles with them and we follow them, and so success now for those is really based on do they hit their unit volume expectations. And they're pretty good at nailing that down generally. And so, nothing that's a barnburner, but really consistent growth around that strategy we've had for the long time which is more high value content per platform. Mike Halloran : Great. Hey, appreciate the time. Heath Mitts : Mike, just to follow on with that, as we think about the second quarter, as I know you're doing your modeling, we do have a little bit of lumpiness on a year-over-year basis in Q2 for HST, specifically, and that's not so much related to the instrumentation customers. It's more related to our MPT, the material process technologies, where we had some \u2013 a couple of \u2013 Q2 will have a couple of more difficult comps that we're coming up against in the second quarter that don't repeat later in the year. So, I just guide that to help you calibrate. Mike Halloran : Thanks, Heath. Operator : Our next question is from Steven Winoker with Bernstein Global Wealth Management. Please proceed with your question. Steven Winoker : Good morning, guys. Andrew Silvernail : Hey, Steve. Steven Winoker : Hey. Just a quick question, do you have other earn-outs \u2013 acquisition earn-out agreements in place across the portfolio? Andrew Silvernail : We don't. Steven Winoker : Okay. And was pricing your typical 1% this quarter positive or something different? Heath Mitts : Steve, this is Heath. It was a little bit lower in the quarter mainly driven by HST, and that's generally because as we've gotten further along with some of the bigger OEM contracts, that's become a bigger piece of the pie. Specifically, for HST, we don't generally reopen those contracts for pricing-related things. But it was a little bit lower than the 1%. But, for the year, I think, modeling probably just inside of 1% is a good number in total for IDEX. Steven Winoker : Okay. And I'm just trying to get my head around the FSDP organic growth again. Outside that trailer projects, last year, organic was down 15%, because I think of the dispensing comps. So, how should I think about or how were you thinking about what real kind of underlying organic was in that unit? Andrew Silvernail : Yeah. I think if you kind of puts and takes [indiscernible] basically flattish. We did see year-over-year order rates that were up a little bit. But if you kind of look at the base overall business, it's kind of flattish with strength in dispensing, decent performance in fire, offset by weakness in rescue and in BAND-IT. Steven Winoker : Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then just one more quickly. I suppose with Akron Brass now, are you guys thinking that your kind of cash availability and debt availability, capacity for M&A this year is on the $0.5 billion range or something \u2013 or you think \u2013 okay. Andrew Silvernail : That's right. Yeah. You hit it on the head. We got about $0.5 billion that we could tap into from our balance sheet. So, think of it over the next three years as being $1 billion-ish. That's another way to think about it. Steven Winoker : Okay. I'll pass it off. Thanks, guys. Andrew Silvernail : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Allison Cusic : Hi, guys. Good morning. Andrew Silvernail : Good morning. Allison Cusic : On water, Andy, you talked about some projects getting pulled forward because of the weather. Is that going to impact, I guess, the seasonality or lack thereof this year? Is that we should be thinking about? Andrew Silvernail : No, it's not a huge number, Allison. So, for IDEX, it's not a huge number for water itself. It's a few million dollars here or there, so I don't think it impacts us looking forward enough to consider it. Allison Cusic : Okay. Perfect. And then just bigger picture, a lot of talk on the stabilization on industrial side, the panic behind it. Trying to be positive here, is there any thoughts or views that maybe we could see an incremental lift as we move in the back half of the year? Andrew Silvernail : I feel really similar to how I felt when we talked after the fourth quarter and my commentary is the same. I still think, overall, there's more downside risks than upside. I know it feels better for a lot of people and I know equities in our space have run here in the last month or so. But when you just look at the underlying conditions and take away the emotion of it and just kind of look at the data, the data does not suggest that there is a really strong upside case. I'd love to be wrong, but, as you know, we've always said this pretty consistently, we are much better at managing for a tighter scenario, and we can move on the upside very quickly. But, given the impact of incremental margins, we don't want to be caught on that downside. So, while I certainly don't feel like the risk has gotten higher in the last quarter, I still think that there's, overall, more downside than upside. Allison Cusic : Great. Thanks. That's very helpful. Andrew Silvernail : Yeah. Operator : Our next question is from Charley Brady with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question. Charley Brady : Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Andrew Silvernail : Hey, Charley. Charley Brady : Hey. Just going back on \u2013 you touched on a little bit earlier kind of beginning of the year things looked like a disaster. We had a pretty good snap back on the industrial space. But, I'm wondering, from your standpoint in terms of order intake, did you see a really sharp dip in the beginning of the year and you've come back to stabilization or plus, and so it's averaging out to kind of stable or \u2013 I'm trying to get a sense, I guess, of the cadence on really the orders through the quarter, first three months of the year. Andrew Silvernail : Well, Charley let me clarify first. I think that the overall, just kind of generally, the commentary that I have today versus the commentary that I had after the end of the year, it really is the same. The difference is you got three more months of stabilization, right? You got a quarter more of stabilization. We started seeing some of the elements of it as we ended the year. But that being said, yeah, as we ramped from our first month through our third month, things did get sequentially stronger, but they also tend to get sequentially stronger, right? So if you look at how a normal quarter flows, it's not that different than the normal \u2013 maybe a little bit better. I guess, people are \u2013 everyone is looking here for a sign of strength. I really don't think it has materially strengthened. I think what you have is another quarter of stability, and the emotional pieces of it that were kind of really pounding in the early months of the year and the late months of last year. That real fear is starting to fall off. The data itself is not dramatically different. Charley Brady : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And I guess, just kind of bigger picture, on the energy exposure that you guys have had, what do you think, in your mind, that your customers are going to have to see? Is it a function of oil goes back to $50 plus a barrel? Obviously, you're not really much in the upstream, so that's a less of an impact on you guys. But I'm just trying to get a sense, from your point of view, when you're looking down the road, 12, 18 months, what happens in energy to kind of get things kind of back on track and maybe get some growth there? Andrew Silvernail : Well, I think the radical swing in capital spending and in MRO, so if I were to go back in time and say what do I think that most of us got wrong to a degree, I think we got two things wrong that have been more amplified \u2013 that have amplified this downturn more than any of us expected. The first thing we got wrong was, I think, people didn't fully appreciate how much the energy capital spending over the last several years was pulling along the things that we define as general industrial, right? And so, the reverberation of that, as things got weaker, it hurt the general industrial, I think, more than people expected it was going to. So I think we got that one thing wrong. The second thing that we got wrong and we're really seeing playing itself out now, specifically, in that area is, historically, on the MRO side, as the big capital spending has slowed down, the MRO side has stabilized or picked up. And one of the things that we're not seeing in this time is you're \u2013 we're seeing differently than necessarily maybe in the past is the amount of pirating that's happening for parts off of things that are being taken offline is pretty dramatic. So why does that matter? It matters because I think that the overall deficit that we've experienced us less so than people who have a lot more exposure, this deficit has been a lot bigger. So what changes? Now, let me address your question really specifically. What changes is that runs its course and the capital spending even picks up modestly, and then you have an MRO deficit now that's got to be filled. Now, when that happens, if I knew that, I'd be in a different line of work. But it feels like the amount of capacity that's coming out, the supply/demand imbalance, at some point, if that turns over, you could see the excess capacity or the need for capacity snap back pretty aggressively. When that happens, if that happens, that's for all the smart people and they'll have to figure out. Charley Brady : Thanks. That's helpful. Appreciate it. Andrew Silvernail : Thanks, Charley. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Maczka with BB&T. Please proceed with your question. Kevin Maczka : Thanks. Good morning. Andrew Silvernail : Hey, Kevin. Kevin Maczka : A couple of follow-up kind of modeling questions on Akron. So, you've got it neutral to earnings this year. The contributions offset by the step-up costs and the interest expense. Can you just talk about where you think margins will be on that business and what's the associated interest expense here this year? Heath Mitts : Kevin, let's see. Let's tackle the easy one first. The interest expense is going to be $0.02 per share. The incremental is what we're anticipating for the year. And that includes, potentially, what we may or may not do in terms of trimming out some of the balance sheet as we think of that through the second half of the year. So it's a $0.02. The other piece to think about is there's certainly going to be a timing element of that. Andy addressed some of that earlier. We are going to work our way through the total purchase price accounting, step-up cost for the inventory in the first and second quarters. So, that'll have a bigger impact in the negative in the first and second quarters. And then, obviously, in the third and fourth quarter, we won't have those same costs. So you'll also get the full-on Akron Brass operating contribution. So, in terms of modeling, there's a little bit of differences, neutral for the year, but it does have a difference between the first and the second half. Kevin Maczka : Right. And then thinking about next year in terms of accretion, so there should be more for two reasons : that $7.6 million of step-up costs goes away that you just mentioned, but, also, you're expecting to grow and improve the margins on this acquired business. Can you talk a little bit about the improving of the margins and where they are now and kind of what you think your potential is here now that you own it? Heath Mitts : Sure. Absent purchase price accounting and absent any intangible amortization, so let's just stick with EBITDA, because I think that's the best apples to apples comparison. It runs about 500 basis points lower than our existing Fire Suppression business. And our existing Fire Suppression business is plus or minus in line with the rest of IDEX, maybe just a tad lower. So, there's 500 basis points that as a stand-alone Akron Brass business that we're going to tackle out of the gate. I would suggest the timing of that's going to take a couple of years to get it up to speed. There's some operating decisions, some footprint discussions underway as we bring the two businesses together, our existing Fire Suppression business with the Akron Brass business. But, as those things happen and we integrate the commercial teams and go through all of that, I think we'll start to realize the synergies in the next two years. Kevin Maczka : Okay. Thank you. Andrew Silvernail : Thanks, Kevin. Operator : Our next question is from Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Scott Graham : Hey. Good morning, guys. How are you? Andrew Silvernail : Good. Scott Graham : Question I have is about the energy and chemical impacts that you guys are \u2013 that you laid out at the top, Andy. You named the businesses. We know them all well. Could you tell us, first of all, the percent of sales from chemical and energy right now? Andrew Silvernail : Well, you've got \u2013 so let's kind of break it into its pieces. So, energy in total, is somewhere north of kind of 10% of the company, right? So, somewhere \u2013 10%, 12% of the company. The upstream piece of it, that's kind of gotten pounded, is about 2%. It was 3% last year. That's just the reality of that. So the stuff that's midstream and downstream makes up the vast majority of what you're looking at what we call energy. And when you think about the chemical piece, the overall chemical piece is a bigger piece, but we're mostly talking about playing in specialty chemicals, right? And so it's not kind of the broad base stuff \u2013 it's not the commodity chemical world. We don't tend to play in that. If you call it chemical and industrial that you put it together, we call that's about 25% to 30% of the total business. Pure chemical out of that is half to two-thirds of that total. Scott Graham : Got you. Now, on that, you have a business that obviously \u2013 the mobile business, could you give us a carve-out of that as well? You went out of your way in the slides here to talk about truck builds and, honestly, I've never heard you talk about that before. Andrew Silvernail : Yeah. Well, the reason we do is, again, when you talk about energy, people tend to think of energy in a very specific way. And the biggest piece of what's in our energy business is LC, Liquid Controls, right? And so, Liquid Controls, a good chunk of that overall business is going into these mobile applications. So, mobile applications mean meters on trucks, right? That's the way to think of it. And you split meters on trucks into two things, kind of road applications and that serving aviation. And so, now, the reality is that if we don't follow the Class 8 to Class 6 truck build that you would think about for kind of heavy industry or whatever, people who are experts in that, we don't necessarily follow that trend. But the reality is that the truck builders and how these guys think about building, in some ways, does connect to that. So, we're not selling into the average Class 6 or Class 8 truck. We're selling into very specifically mobile energy applications. But there is some correlation between the truck builders that are producing kind of the general Class 6 or Class 8 and the folks who are selling into these mobile markets. So, there is some connection to that. We don't follow the broad trend. Scott Graham : That's very interesting, the way you look at that. Okay. Thank you. That's all I had. Very nice quarter, guys. Andrew Silvernail : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Our next question is from Jim Foung with Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your question. James Foung : Hi. Good morning, Andy, Heath. Andrew Silvernail : Hi, Jim. James Foung : Yeah. I just have one question. I was wondering if you could just size kind of the amount of business you may have potentially lost due to oil prices. As we look out to next 12 months with oil firming up and the business coming back, can you just try and figure out how much you can recover as we kind of see the reverse of this? Andrew Silvernail : So, let's talk about the easy piece of that, Jim, which is the piece that's close to the wellhead. As I've mentioned, we probably had a total of 1% negative on that. So if that was 3% of our business a year ago, it's now 2% of our business. So it really truly is, in and of itself, a 1% headwind on IDEX, right? And then you probably have another 1% to 2% if you kind of scope across the rest of IDEX. Call it $10 million to $20 million more of incremental revenue that's probably been \u2013 that you can kind of put your finger on directly. So, call it 2 points of organic growth headwind, up to 2 points of the organic growth headwind that's just kind of directly tied to that. Now, it gets a lot more muddled and a lot less clear as you think about these ripple effects that have impacted everybody. The story that I tell often is a few years ago, we looked at this business in North Dakota. It had nothing to do with the energy world, but we looked at this business in North Dakota and you couldn't drive into the \u2013 you couldn't get a parking spot at the parking at the Wal-Mart, you couldn't get a hotel room, anything, right? And you go there today and the parking lot at the Wal-Mart is empty and you can get any hotel room you want at half the cost. And so, what I guess the reason I tell that story is, I think we all, again, underestimated the rippling effect in certain areas of that energy cycle. And so, as it comes back, I don't think it's going to be as dramatic. I wish I could pick a timeframe, but that's for you guys to do. But I do think that not only do you get the direct impacts of what's happened to the energy industry, I think you will get some positive residual impact to the general industrial. James Foung : Do you think that number would match that 2% of direct headwind that you see? Andrew Silvernail : Again, I think the upside and the downside were pretty dramatic. So, what you got? Pre-2015 was pretty dramatic on the upside, and what we lived with last year was pretty dramatic on the downside and through the first quarter. Do I think it's going to snap back one for one? I think that would be optimistic. James Foung : All right. But it's something like \u2013 it's somewhere between $50 million to $100 million of revenues, potential revenues... Andrew Silvernail : No. No, that's too heavy. Somewhere between $20 million and $40 million. James Foung : $20 million to $40 million? Andrew Silvernail : Yeah. Yeah. James Foung : All right. Great. Thanks so much. Andrew Silvernail : Yeah. Operator : Our next question is from Bhupender Bohra with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Bhupender Bohra : Hey. Good morning, guys. Andrew Silvernail : Good morning. Bhupender Bohra : So, my question revolves around HST. You've done a good job improving margins here. If I look back historically, this segment underwent through some restructuring. Where do we think margins would actually progress in the second half of FY 2016? And, holistically, where \u2013 Health & Science in terms of new products, especially with exposure to MPT, some of the long-cycle businesses here, where do you think \u2013 as you progress into 2017, can you give us some color on that? Andrew Silvernail : So, Bhupender, I apologize. You broke up a little bit in your question. So, I think, if I heard you right, you were asking what do we think the back half HST margin looks like. I heard that clearly. I didn't hear the second part of your question clearly. Bhupender Bohra : Yeah. Second part of the question, kind of holistically, if you look at HST, you've done a good job improving margins here. How do we think \u2013 like, what is actually driving the core sales for the business in terms of when you have \u2013 when you look at the exposure from MPT and Sealing Solution businesses? Andrew Silvernail : Okay. So, let me \u2013 I'll try to tackle that, and if I don't get your question, if I don't answer it just right, please reframe it. So, yeah, we've done a nice job of getting this business up to speed. The way I break it down is kind of on the revenue side and then let's talk margins. And obviously, they're interconnected, but there's a couple of different stories in here. On the revenue side, we've seen real strength consistently out of those things that are scientific in nature, right? So life sciences, semiconductor, some of the electronic world that we touch marginally, those have been good and, by the way, have good profitability associated with them. And we've also had strength in improving margin to parts of the portfolio that were weaker. So if you look at MPT or if you look at Optics, over the last couple of years, we've done a nice job of moving profitability up. So you've seen the op margin move, but the bottom \u2013 but the top line is a little bit deceptive. And the reason for that is you've got a good chunk of that overall HST that's still really is industrial, right? So you've got a big chunk of \u2013 you've got the Gast and the Micropump businesses. You've got a good chunk of even the Optics business that's more industrial-related. And then you got a big piece of the sealing business that is touching oil and gas. So we've had some really \u2013 some nice strength on the scientific side offset by some weakness on the industrial side, but in total, overall margins that have had nice improvement. So, I think I may have missed your back question about MPT. So, if you'd repeat that, I'd appreciate it. Bhupender Bohra : No. I think you answered the question on MPT. My thinking on MPT was MPT was kind of a long-cycle business within HST. And when you talked about the capital spending within the industrial business, overall, broadly weak right now, how should we think about that in the second half, especially, you're thinking is like there's much more \u2013 still more risk to the economy in terms of spending? Andrew Silvernail : I think so. And I think to be clear about some things, because there's a few things depending upon how you take it, it could be some mixed messages. The first one is our overall view is you're getting some industrial stability. As that moves to the back half, you end up with some easier comps. And whether or not that's industrial, within FMT or some of the industrial parts of HST, you get moderately easier comps as you get to the back half of the year because of the real weakness that we saw last year. So, to me, that's a good news story, but not because the business is materially improving sequentially, so I don't want anyone to walk out of here saying, God, I'm confused. Andy is saying there's more risk to the downside, but we're going to be better in the second half. These are really consistent statements, right? We've seen stability. We've got a little bit easier comps in the back of the year. But, in total, as I look at the global economy and I look at the puts and the takes and whether there's more upside or more downside, given the underlying fundamentals, we believe that still there remains more downside than upside. Bhupender Bohra : Got it. Thank you. Andrew Silvernail : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Jim Giannakouros with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. Jim Giannakouros : Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for sneaking me in here. Andrew Silvernail : You get, Jim. Jim Giannakouros : Yeah. So my question is on your organic growth investment dollars and where you're funneling those. I understand it maybe early in the year for you to be shifting those, but can you talk about where you're focusing, specifically, your organic growth investment currently? What businesses the focus is squarely on improving returns? And where growth investment won't be dedicated anytime soon? And if you've shifted your thoughts just given any surprises over the last six months, whether that's market based or just the efficacy of execution of internal strategies from specific business lines? Thanks. Andrew Silvernail : Yeah. So, Jim, when you look at our investments like this, they tend not to have radical swings in the short term. And the reason I say that is because from the time you decide that you're going to aggressively going to go after an idea until the time it's launched and then, I call it, full absorption into the marketplace, those cycles are really long. And that really works to our benefit around when you win market share or you win new applications, the stickiness of those is really the fundamental driver to the economics of IDEX, right? That stickiness is a big deal. That being said, it takes a long time for that to happen, right? Our customers are highly risk adverse and they test and they poke for an awful long time before making any kind of radical decision. The reason I say that is that requires sustained long-term investment. And so, we tend not to jump around a lot in that. So, just kind of behaviorally, I think that's important to understand. To kind of directly answering your question, which is where we focused, a way to think about that is if you look at our portfolio and our businesses, and this is all public stuff we talked about before at investor meetings. We've got about two-thirds of our company in revenue and about three quarters of our company in profit that I would squarely put into the growth category, right? These are franchise businesses with clear number one or really strong number two positions. I'm talking about franchise brands like IDEX Health & Science, the Scientific Fluidics business. I'm talking about Viking, Warren Rupp, right? Gast. Even though our Rescue business is struggling, if you look at the brands within rescue, they're outstanding. If you look at our BAND-IT brand, even though it's got headwinds from oil and gas, they are a franchise business. I can go kind of down through that list. And so, they've got great positioning, terrific fundamental economics, we're going to \u2013 we are investing for growth, we incent for growth around those businesses pretty aggressively. And by the way, we differentiate how we think about resource allocation with those businesses. On the flip side \u2013 and by the way, I would say that it's much more biased today around new product and new channel than it is anything else. The other part of it is, we've got about a quarter of our business, a little bit less than a quarter, that I'm going to put into the category of fix, meaning they don't have IDEX-like profitability. Now, to be clear, I think a lot of people we [kill] for the profitability of what we call fix. You're talking about EBITDA margins that are solidly in the mid-to-upper teens, but they're not in the mid-teens or mid-20%s rather EBITDA margins like all of IDEX. So there's a series of businesses in there that we still can \u2013 we think can move and can fix. They look like our fire business that's had a 1,000-basis point improvement over the last several years. And so there are some businesses squarely in there, that, boy, we think we can move the margins very substantially. And by the way, a bunch of the performance that you see in here, we've had great performance in those fixed businesses through the first quarter. And then you got a small portion of the business that's kind of \u2013 we define it as outperform, meaning, we want you to win in your markets. We expect you to keep up with the competition, but you're kind of not in either one of those categories today. So, that's how we differentiate. And we really think about resource allocation and we think about the mission that each one of those businesses have really clearly upon where they fit in to the definitions. And they understand their missions. Jim Giannakouros : That's helpful. Thank you. Andrew Silvernail : You bet. Operator : There are no further questions. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Andrew Silvernail for closing remark. Andrew Silvernail : Thank you, Rob. I appreciate that. So, everyone, first of all, I appreciate you taking the time to spend with us to talk about the first quarter. Our comments, hopefully, everyone's walking away with the clarity of our message, which is, we think we're executing quite well in a continued challenging market. There has been some stability in the markets, which is good, but we still think there's still lots of challenges here ahead, but we're very, very well-positioned, and I'm thrilled with how our teams have performed. Our folks throughout IDEX have really performed well to make sure that we're delivering value for our customers, for the people who work at IDEX and, very importantly, for you, our shareholders. So, I appreciate your time, and we look forward to talking to you in the future. Take care. Operator : This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

As we begin, a brief reminder. This call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the Safe Harbor language in today\u2019s press release and in IDEX\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I will turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Andy Silvernail. Andy Silvernail : Thanks Mike. I appreciate everyone joining us here for our second quarter 2016 discussion. As Mike said, I am going to start off here with just a little bit of an overview before getting to some more detailed commentary. Just as a highlight, as an overview here, we had strong execution, especially from the bottom line perspective here in the second quarter. The second quarter economic picture is still pretty mixed, if you look at the North American industrial markets, especially on a year-over-year basis, that continues to be pretty soft. However, we have started to see some sequential improvement in those markets, specifically within FMT and with HST, which gives us some positive reaction. If you look at our consumer-facing businesses or those things that touch the consumer in one way or another, life sciences, automotive dispensing and if you look at the municipal facing businesses of water, fire and rescue, those all remain pretty solid. The question marks that really exist out there on top of the overall North American industrial environment in the direction that\u2019s going to take is really around China, which continues to be soft, and obviously, the questions around Brexit and how that\u2019s going to impact the overall European economic condition. And as we look at the industrial markets and we think about the impact and the derivative impacts of the oil and gas business how that\u2019s going to play out here for the balance of the year. The bottom line, however, is given continued questionable market conditions I think our team has done a very good job in the second quarter in terms of execution. As I mentioned, we did see some sequential improvement. We saw, throughout the quarter, a ratable increase in business. We had $168 million May, $168 million in April, $177 million in May and $184 million June in terms of orders. And in June, we delivered about $200 million in sales, which drove most of the operational improvement that we have talked about. So, we are still very cognizant of the challenges that are out there in the marketplace. We have done a great job controlling cost and driving margin. And overall, this has produced pretty strong results that we saw in the quarter. Orders and sales were up 5% and 7% respectively. Organically, they were down 2% and 1% respectively. Our GAAP EPS was $0.99, which is up $0.10, 11% higher than a year ago. And we had operating margin of 20.6%, which was down 70 basis points and I will get into that here a little bit, but that was really impacted by the fair value step up for Akron Brass and the remaining continued consideration for CIDRA, but again, I will talk about that in more detail in a minute. In terms of our commitment to strategic acquisitions, we have continued to drive that strategic priority. On July 1, we completed the acquisition of AWG. They are a leader in the European Fire and Safety markets and they are a terrific fit with Akron Brass and our existing fire and rescue platform. And so really, it\u2019s just wonderful to invite AWG into our family. Additionally, in the second quarter, we completed the private placement of $200 million of senior notes. Our quarterly dividend of $0.34 was up 6% year-over-year. And we continued, albeit at a slower pace, our repurchase plan and our M&A pipeline remains robust. Like I think everybody out there in the marketplace, we are still not certain exactly what Brexit is going to mean for us in the longer term. In the shorter term, it did have an impact on us in the quarter. And as we look at the second half, if we assume that the rates remain the same between the dollar, the pound and the euro, we will have some translation pressure in the second half of the year. Let me turn now and talk a little bit about core markets and geographies and what we are seeing out there. In terms of energy, the lack of demand is still a headwind for us, specifically in our energy platform, at BAND-IT and at Sealing Solutions. And as we have stated before, the lower energy prices, they do impact our industrial businesses from a derivative effect and that\u2019s still a condition in the marketplace. As we think about the industrial businesses. Industrial distribution remains challenged, especially when compared to a year ago. But as I said a second ago, we have seen signs of stabilization in the marketplace. Ag continues to be a challenge also. Commodity prices have remained depressed in the second quarter. We don\u2019t expect that to rebound as we have said for some time, but we have seen some stabilization there too. Scientific Fluidics continues to be strong across our markets in bio, analytical instrumentation and IVD and we expect that to remain the same through the balance of the year. And as I said a moment ago, municipal has been a good story for us. In terms of regions, in North America, the story really all is about industrial distribution and how that\u2019s playing out. Some signs of stability are a good note. But the picture remains pretty much the same as we have been talking about here for a couple of quarters. In Europe, we actually have \u2013 we have over-delivered in Europe around our dispensing and our water businesses in a tough environment. But certainly, the Brexit decision leaves some question marks that we will have to play out here over the coming quarters. And finally, in Asia, it\u2019s really a story of two major economies. One is China that continues to be \u2013 continues to struggle, that\u2019s not a surprise at all. We are managing that well. But the good news story for us has been India and we have seen strong demand with fire, rescue, energy and dispensing as we have executed throughout that region. Let me turn to capital deployment for a moment here. Our capital deployment strategies for investing in long-term growth disciplined M&A, consistent dividends and opportunistic share repurchases remains unchanged. And as we look at our ability to deploy capital here in the future, we are in a really good position. We completed the $200 million private placement. The proceeds of which we paid down our revolver. Today, we have about $500 million of availability on our revolver. That availability, plus cash on hand, gives us lot of capability. In fact, we paid for the AWG transaction completely out of cash from our balance sheet. So, when you put together our balance sheet availability, cash on hand and what will be more than $500 million of free cash flow after paying dividends and after investing full in the company, we are going to have north of $1 billion to deploy here over the next 3 years. In terms of organic growth, the story remains the same. We continue to make investments to drive profitable growth for years to come. This year, in particular, we have made specific bets in Scientific Fluidics, Sealing and our fire businesses and they are all positioned well for long-term growth. In terms of dividend, as I mentioned, we announced a $0.34 dividend here in the quarter, which is 6% above last year. In terms of share repurchases, we bought back 726,000 shares this year for $56 million, and that\u2019s at about $77 a share on average. In terms of M&A, we have had an active year as you know. We purchased AWG on July 1 for \u20ac46 million, which has about $36 million of sales and that complements well with Akron, which fits into our fire and rescue platform. And together, along with our existing businesses, really makes a market leading platform in that space. In terms of M&A, the pipeline continues to be strong. Really no change from what we discussed earlier in the year. All the work that we have done and continuing to cultivate our M&A pipeline has certainly paid off for us and we expect it to do so again in the future. Okay. With that, let\u2019s switch now to talk about results for the quarter. I am on Slide 4. In Q2, we had $550 million of revenue, which is up 7%, down 1% organically. Orders are $529 million, which are up 5%, down 2% organically. On an organic basis, both orders and sales, has been challenged. However, as we look at the second half of the year, we are facing easier comps and so we do expect the flat overall organic growth for the year. Operating margin, as I mentioned earlier, was 20.6%, down 70 basis points year-over-year. Similar to last quarter, our 2Q results include a few moving parts and I will get to here on the next slide. Overall, again, I am very, very impressed with our team\u2019s ability to execute in the challenging environment. Free cash flow was $80 million. This is 106% of net income. It was down $6 million from last year, but that\u2019s entirely due to the timing of some tax payments here in the U.S. And so we will get the benefit on a comparable basis here in the back half of the year. And finally, net income came in at $75 million with GAAP EPS at $0.99, up $0.10 or 11% from last year. So, let me just take a minute now and I want to bridge for you the $0.99 of EPS on Slide 5 here compared to the midpoint of the bridge \u2013 or the midpoint of the guidance that we gave you last quarter. So turn to Slide 5 for me and you will see the bridge. The midpoint of the guidance from a quarter ago was $0.92 and we delivered $0.99. And just let me walk you through the elements of the bridge. First was very solid execution that gave us about 2 points a beat in the quarter. Lower inventory step up gave us another $0.02 from Akron Brass is lower than expected. We had the reversal of a contingent consideration of $1 million from CIDRA and that gave us $0.01 of benefit. We had lower tax rate from an excess tax benefit for the new accounting for share-based compensation that gave us $0.01. And we also got $0.01 from the rapid change in the exchange rate between the dollar and the British pounds here with the Brexit announcement and that gave us $0.01 too. So all told, when you add that up, that is the $0.07 a beat versus the midpoint of our expectations. Let me transition now to the segment discussion. I am on Slide 6 and we will start with Fluid & Metering. In the second quarter, organic order has decreased 1 point, while organic sales increased 1%. And I know it\u2019s a small number, but this is the first increase in organic sales we have had at FMT since the first quarter of 2015. Margins were up 20 basis points, driven by an increase in volume and energy. Specifically within energy, we saw a stronger aviation market that was offset with the mobile market that was softer. And we did ship a few large international projects in the second quarter that have been delayed for several quarters. And we had mentioned that in the past, but those kind of all came here in the second quarter. And these \u2013 the delivery of this business really was the bulk of the over-performance here in terms of operational over-performance. Water had another good quarter. Sequentially, they continued to improve and they have over the last few quarters. The municipal markets remain favorable. And we have had just a great profit execution as the team at water. Industrial, as I mentioned before, continues to be soft on a year-over-year basis, but we are seeing some signs of stability, which is encouraging. And we have done really a great job around cost control and profit execution in our industrial businesses in FMT. And then finally, ag continues to be soft. We expect it to be so for the balance of the year, but it\u2019s certainly not deteriorating any further. With that, let\u2019s turn to Slide 7 and we will talk about Health & Science. Overall, the life sciences and the scientific markets remain strong and steady, with softness in those businesses that are facing the industrial marketplace. Organic orders were flat in the quarter and organic sales were down 2% and operating margins were down 30 basis points, really from the lower volume in the industrial portion of the segment. Scientific Fluidics continues to be a good news stories. Orders and sales continue to be up in all markets over 2015. We have seen strength in analytical instrumentation, bio and IVD. All of those marketplaces continue to deliver and again we expect that to do so for the balance of the year. In terms of Sealing Solutions, we had an uptick in Q2, really coming out of strength in our semiconductor business, although was offset in many parts by the weakness in oil and gas and heavy equipment. HST Industrial, which I mentioned earlier, that has had dynamics that are very, very similar to what we have seen within FMT and so we are still seeing negatives on a year-over-year basis, but again, some signs of stability on a sequential basis. And then finally, at MPT, we had some strength in Asia with some shipments of some projects. So, we had a decent quarter at MPT. Okay. I am on our final segment, Diversified, on Slide 8. Organic orders that were down 9 points in the quarter, with sales \u2013 organic sales down 1 point and operating margins were down 400 basis points versus prior year. That being said, the real impact here came from the remaining inventory step up at Akron Brass, which was $3.6 million. If you exclude that, operating margins came in at 26.6%, which is down 150 basis points versus last year. But remember, this is our full \u2013 our first full quarter of having Akron into the business. And I would also ask you to remember that in the second quarter, we are going to see $2 million more of fair value inventory step up for AWG. Dispensing continues to outperform. X-Smart has been a true success story for us, especially in developing markets. We have shipped our 25,000th unit in the quarter. And remember, we launched this just three years ago. This is a great example of our team\u2019s ability to drive organic growth. And fire and rescue, again, we have welcomed AWG and Akron into the family. It gives us a terrific market leading position. Rescue continues to struggle in the international markets and has for several quarters now. But we have had a great launch of our StrongArm technology, which we think is going to be a real success for us. Finally, BAND-IT, the transportation business within BAND-IT has been strong. But general, industrial and oil and gas continue to be challenged overall. We did see, interestingly enough, some improvement in businesses as oil prices reached over $50. And while I certainly wouldn\u2019t call that a recovery, it\u2019s certainly an interesting data point to see how that tracks so closely as we saw oil break a $50 a barrel in the quarter until it settles back down. Okay, I am on the final slide, Slide 9. Let me give you some guidance here for the third quarter and also for the balance of 2016. In Q3, we expect EPS to be $0.90 to $0.92, but just please remember that, that includes $0.02 of inventory charge associated with AWG, and we are going to get a $0.01 of pressure from the additional interest expense from the private placement that we did in June. Operating margins will come in at about 20.5%. We expect organic revenue to be flat. And in Q3, the tax rates should be about 27%. If you look at the full year, we are maintaining our guidance at $3.70 to $3.75. Also remember, we have $0.02 of interest expense from the private placement and as well as $0.01 of incremental impact from AWG for the fair value step up charges and we will also have some impact from purchase accounting amortization. For the full year, we are still expecting revenue to be approximately flat. Operating margins should come in at 20.5% to 21%. CapEx should be $40 million to $45 million. Free cash flow, we are expecting to be at about 120% of net income. And for the full year, we are expecting a share reduction of about 1% for the year. As always, remember to exclude any impact from our guidance from acquisitions, either costs or the benefits in the future. With that, Rob, let me stop here and let\u2019s turn it over for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions. Nathan Jones : Good morning, Andy, Heath, Mike. Andy Silvernail : Nathan, good morning. Heath Mitts : Good morning. Nathan Jones : Andy, could you just start by telling us how much those international energy projects contributed to the quarter? Andy Silvernail : Yes, it was about $6 million in total that we shipped pretty much in the last week of the month. So, it was substantial and it flowed through at some pretty decent levels. And so that\u2019s a big piece of the operational execution. And just remember, Nathan, this is stuff that\u2019s been sitting in backlog for an awful long time. It\u2019s pretty unpredictable when it ships and both \u2013 or actually two or three of them just kind of broke at the exact same time. Nathan Jones : Is there more that\u2019s still delayed sitting in backlog? Are there any other orders sitting in backlog or is this truly something we should be thinking about as discrete? Andy Silvernail : Yes, not of substance, Nathan. We have got some smaller things here and there. As you know, we don\u2019t have a lot of large things that tend to sit in backlog. These are things that are being shipped to North Africa, the Middle East and they require letters of credit and an incredibly painful process to get them shipped. And frankly, they are incredibly unpredictable and we had not had them in our forecast. We actually had them in the forecast for later in the year and they happened to break in the second quarter. Nathan Jones : Okay. And then just on the guidance for the rest of the year, you had about 2% organic decline in the first half, to get to flat you need plus 2 in the second half. I don\u2019t think the comps are that much easier in the second half than they are in the first half. Organic orders is still running negative. Where does that incremental demand come from that can get you to flat organically for the year? Heath Mitts : Nathan, this is Heath. Largely, it\u2019s the things that we have visibility to in the fourth quarter. As you know, there is a little bit of seasonality in some of our businesses, specifically around oil and gas and a few things in the rescue tools side. So, it\u2019s our current outlook in terms of where we see the third and fourth quarter coming in. But most of that growth is going to come from the fourth quarter \u2013 the fourth quarter numbers. And obviously, we will get smart over the next 90 days and sharpen our pencils if that changes. Nathan Jones : Okay. And I don\u2019t know that you are going to be able to answer this question. You talked about industrial distribution stabilizing or maybe getting a little bit better sequentially. Do you have any visibility into what kind of end markets are helping there or do you lose visibility once it gets into the distribution channel? Andy Silvernail : You certainly lose visibility into the distribution channel, although I will say that the businesses that we saw then tend to be pretty good predictors for us, so with the exception of one. So, we saw strength at Viking [indiscernible]. When I say strength, it means stability, so not improvement necessarily, Nathan. But certainly, the decrease stopped at Viking, at Rupp and at the industrial businesses within or the industrial distribution business within BAND-IT. The one counter to that is we still saw some softness at Gast. And typically, Gast kind of goes along with those other three. So, that was the one contra-indicator, but those other three were good signs. Nathan Jones : And then I wonder if you could just give me a little bit more color on the comment that you made that you saw some improvement in oil and gas markets when the price got to $50 a barrel. Can you talk about where the demand improvement stabilization, whatever we want to call it here, came from being upstream, midstream, downstream, MRO? Andy Silvernail : That was \u2013 so, the comment was really specific to BAND-IT, which has very, very short cycle delivery and it was more around the MRO marketplace. And so I think, again, I want to be really clear. We are not calling for any kind of recovery. Just it really struck us how tightly correlated the improvement in the BAND-IT MRO business was when that ticked above $50. And so I just \u2013 what that tells me, Nathan, is just how tight the overall supply chain is. And the fact that when you do see recovery, I think it\u2019s going to be \u2013 it\u2019s going to come at a pace that\u2019s going to move pretty quickly, especially around parts and service. Nathan Jones : That\u2019s very helpful. I will jump back in the line. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Steven Winoker with Bernstein Global. Please proceed with your questions. Steven Winoker : Thanks and good morning, all. Andy Silvernail : Good morning, Steve. Steven Winoker : Just want to push on one of your answers to that last question, I think that second half, not only is a couple percent, but the fourth quarter is \u2013 means 4% implied. And in fact, quarter-to-quarter, there really is no comp difference in total from getting easier. So, can you push a little harder there to give us some comfort level that all of a sudden we jumped to 4? Andy Silvernail : Yes, I think, first of all, Steve, you got to keep it in perspective. That\u2019s a, to get there, that\u2019s a $550 million quarter, which is what we just did. Now, we did burn some backlog in the second quarter. We would expect that to reverse itself to some degree. So, it\u2019s not \u2013 while the flat versus 4 or down 1 versus 4 seems like a giant number, recognize it\u2019s that when you look at it from a comp perspective and you look at on a sequential perspective, it\u2019s not that big a number, it\u2019s the same number we delivered this quarter. Steven Winoker : Okay, that\u2019s fair. And then just getting a little bit into that FSDP order decline to 9%, I think I understood what happened of the sales front. Is it \u2013 are you seeing the same dynamics though in the order \u2013 would you attribute it to the same areas then? Andy Silvernail : That\u2019s just a more \u2013 remember, that\u2019s the most lumpy of our business, right, when it comes right down to it. And so you will see that disconnect between order and sales that you don\u2019t see in the other businesses. There is nothing there that jumps out to you that says that, that is \u2013 has a significant disconnect from history or that\u2019s a big red flag in the future. I don\u2019t see that happening. Heath Mitts : Yes. Steve, that\u2019s \u2013 obviously, that\u2019s the smallest segment. And it\u2019s a little bit of the tyranny of small numbers a little bit in terms of just a couple of million can swing it either way. So, I wouldn\u2019t read anything into that. Steven Winoker : Okay. And one more question and I have been debating with investors is in your last financial reporting, one of the things you guys had talked about was how revenue from new products introduced in the last 3 years has dropped to 8%. Where is that \u2013 and I think it used to be 20% in prior years, where is that trending these days and what\u2019s been driving that number down? Andy Silvernail : Steve, I think you may have us confused as somebody else. We haven\u2019t reported any new product sales numbers in years. Steven Winoker : It\u2019s in the last \u2013 it\u2019s in the last \u2013 it\u2019s in the 10-K on Page 8 from this year. Heath Mitts : I will have to look at it. I am not sure what you are referencing. I apologize. I am happy to follow up with you on that, but let me take that offline. Steven Winoker : No problem. But it is there on Page 8. It says new products from \u2013 revenues from new products introduced in the last 3 years. So, it\u2019s an NPVI referenced and I looked at it this morning, so I would love to understand that. Heath Mitts : I will have to get back to you, sorry. Steven Winoker : Okay, okay. That\u2019s fine, we\u2019ll follow-up offline. I will pass it on. Thanks. Heath Mitts : No problem. Thanks, Steve. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Matt McConnell with RBC. Please go ahead with your questions. Matt McConnell : Thank you. Good morning. Andy Silvernail : Hey, Matt. Matt McConnell : You talked about the order ramps through the quarter and certainly each month got better. How does that compare to the normal seasonality within \u2013 so, was that ramp up in orders through the quarter the same as what you typically see or was it \u2013 were the underlying trends better? Andy Silvernail : It is a little bit stronger, Matt, than what we had seen. Now typically, you will see some difference between early on in the month \u2013 early on in the quarter to later on in the quarter, but it did improve especially on the sales basis. But even on the orders, it was a little bit better than what we have seen in the past. Matt McConnell : Okay, great. And then on the balance sheet, how much of your cash is accessible right now, because you did the private placement ahead of pretty strong cash generation period over the next couple of quarters, I would expect. So, of that $360 million, how much is kind of available if you were to have U.S. needs? Heath Mitts : Well, Matt, this is Heath. Most of that, as you can imagine, is offshore. And most of it resides in Europe with some in China as well. So, it would be fair to say we could probably pretty easily get our hands on about $200 million of it without having to do too much on the tax side in terms of dividending things back and forth. But it\u2019s somewhere between $150 million, $200 million will be easily accessible and then all of a sudden, it gets a little more challenging. Matt McConnell : Okay, great. Thanks very much. Andy Silvernail : Thanks, Matt. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Mike Halloran with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead with your questions. Mike Halloran : Hey, good morning everyone. Andy Silvernail : Good morning. Mike Halloran : Good morning. Hey, just quick follow-up on Matt\u2019s first question. When you look at orders as they track through the quarter, did orders turn positive as you got to that June month with that ramp through the quarter or are you still tracking modestly negative by the end of the quarter on a month-to-month basis? Andy Silvernail : You mean June versus June comparison? Mike Halloran : Yes, year-over-year, sorry. Andy Silvernail : Yes, let me go back and look at that. I am going to say yes, but I don\u2019t have the number right in front of me. Just by the nature of where it was coming out in April versus where we ended for the quarter, the answer to that is going to be yes, but let me caution you on that, right. Any one month of orders and/or sales is not a good barometer for direction. Mike Halloran : No, no, absolutely, but orders turning positive for the first time in a while. Just curious if that was the case. And then on the CapEx side, you guys lowered that from 50 to, I think, you said in the call 40 to 45, the deck says 45. Anything behind that, Andy, or is that just kind of normal machinations? Andy Silvernail : No, it\u2019s just normal stuff. You end up typically as you come into the year with a pretty large wish list, right. And as the year gets down, as you look at the ability of the units to actually absorb the capital, it just tightens over time. That\u2019s a pretty natural pattern for us. Mike Halloran : Alright. So, it\u2019s tightening and not incremental concern from your perspective on the environment and investability? Andy Silvernail : No, no. Mike Halloran : Great. Appreciate it. Andy Silvernail : You bet, Mike. Take care. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions. Allison Poliniak : Hi, guys. Good morning. Andy Silvernail : Hi, Allison. Allison Poliniak : Andy, can we just go back? I think it was Nathan that asked the question on stabilization. I think last quarter when we talked, you noticed some stabilization, but you still thought there was a lot of risk versus opportunities out there right now. I mean, has that changed at all for you and your thoughts? Andy Silvernail : Yes, I think the bottom has come up a little bit, Allison. So, I certainly \u2013 I am not going to take away all the concern that I had. If I look back toward last quarter, the big concerns that I have really had were around softness on the industrial side potentially moving into a recession and then the really big questions on China and then finally, just kind of the constant concerns in Europe. And so if I were to kind of step forward and say what\u2019s changed instead in China, it stays exactly the same. I think Europe, we have actually performed better. We have had pretty strong performance, specifically in dispensing and in water. But the Brexit stuff, it just puts a level of uncertainty that frankly it\u2019s hard to get your hands around what exactly that could mean. So, I would say, in total, I would say that\u2019s modestly worse than where we were a quarter ago. And in the U.S., with another quarter of stabilization in industrial distribution, I think that\u2019s modestly better. Allison Poliniak : No, that\u2019s great. Thanks. And then just on acquisitions, you broadened obviously your pipeline. Is there any area that maybe looking particularly more attractive in this environment or a product category that you guys are a little bit more focused on in that pipeline? Andy Silvernail : Not necessarily. As you know, we kind of think of our pipeline around kind of four major areas, right. So, industrial fluids, HST components, engineered fastening and then around fire and safety. So, if you look at our pipeline, it\u2019s pretty decent throughout. I will say that within the HST world, things are still at really frothy levels and so you have just not seen as many opportunities nor is the cultivation kind of moving along as rapidly as you would love. That being said, in the other three areas, it\u2019s pretty good. So, we are continuing to work that. We work it every single month. So, it\u2019s just an ongoing strategic process for us. And right now, it looks pretty decent. Allison Poliniak : That\u2019s great. Thank you, guys. Andy Silvernail : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Charlie Brady with SunTrust Robinson. Please go ahead with your question. Charlie Brady : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Andy Silvernail : Good morning, Charlie. Charlie Brady : I just want to comment on the commentary around the Brexit commentary. I mean, are you hearing anything specific subsequent to that vote from our customers or have you seen any movement in terms of projects being slowed or pushed out or is it just kind of, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen yet, but nothing definitive from a customer base standpoint? Andy Silvernail : Yes, it\u2019s nothing definitive. And just to give you some kind of some sense of what it all looks like, right. So, if you look at our total revenue, it\u2019s about 5% or so of the business that\u2019s moving through the UK. Our cost base is actually on a comparative basis is a little bit higher. So, we actually have a decent hedge there all in all. So, I don\u2019t think we are going to get pounded from transactional or a translational perspective. It\u2019s pretty well hedged. And so far, we haven\u2019t seen that play it sell-through, except for how currencies have moved and what that\u2019s done on a translational basis. I think the bigger concern for me, Charlie, is if that starts contagion, right. That\u2019s I think the UK in and of itself is, not a huge concern. The bigger concern is that if it starts to kind of snowball such role here throughout Europe. Charlie Brady : Right, thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And just one more on HST, can you give us a little more granularity on the industrial piece of that business, how much was that off? And did you see, in terms of stabilization of that business, improvements through the quarter as well or was it just kind of soft throughout? Andy Silvernail : Well, except for Gast, right. So, Gast is a pretty good size business for us and it\u2019s a good profit generator. And unlike what we saw in FMT, where we saw Viking and Rupp, we saw some really nice stabilization there. We did see continued softness into gas. And remember, Gast has a good chunk of its business that\u2019s going into the scientific world and then it\u2019s got the majority of its business, frankly, that\u2019s general industrial. And that\u2019s the general industrial piece that continued to be soft. And so we are keeping an eye on it. But if you look at the four of the \u2013 four things that we kind of look at as early indicators : Viking, Rupp, Gast, and BAND-IT. Three of the four certainly saw some positive signs from stabilization, Gast was the outlier. Charlie Brady : Great, thanks. Andy Silvernail : Yes. Operator : The next question is from the line of Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your questions. Scott Graham : Hey, good morning. Andy Silvernail : Good morning, Scott. Scott Graham : So, you indicated that during the quarter that you felt better about orders. And I know you talked about that more in a sequential basis and I think others then are asking and I was going to ask the same thing about the year-over-year. And you cited, in particular, feeling better about distribution, yet the distributors are kind of saying it went the other way in the middle of the quarter. So, I am hoping you could help us with that a little bit, particularly the year-over-years would be helpful in the month? Andy Silvernail : You got to remember, Scott, when you \u2013 the stuff that came out this morning for some of the distributors are the commodity distributors, right. And we played very minimally there. We are playing more in the value-added side of distribution that bring engineering content to work. So, I fully recognize that what you saw specifically out of Grainger here this morning flies in the face of some of the stuff that what we saw in the quarter, but remember, we just don\u2019t play a lot in their world of distribution. Scott Graham : Okay. I just would add that MSC Industrial and Fastenal, which are maybe a little bit more engineered than that? Andy Silvernail : They are really not, Scott. Those guys all play in that same world of pretty much commoditized piece parts. So, I think we touch them very modestly. Now that being said, I fully \u2013 we pay attention to them too and what\u2019s going on with in the marketplace. And so I think that\u2019s you are making an important point here. What we are seeing are signs of stability. To be very, very clear, we are not seeing signs of continued erosion. And I think what we are seeing in the marketplace and everybody had been seeing in the marketplace, certainly around anything that was commodities related and then the derivative impact had been continued negatives. And what we are seeing is some stability. I know that\u2019s not exactly the most encouraging statement in the world, but stability to me is encouraging given what we had been experiencing. Scott Graham : Look, stability is the new up, Andy. Andy Silvernail : It doesn\u2019t feel very good. Does it? Scott Graham : No, it doesn\u2019t. The other question I had was around pricing, are you guys still pricing positive? Andy Silvernail : We are. Yes, we are. Scott Graham : And there is still a gap between that and inflation? Andy Silvernail : Yes. Heath Mitts : Yes, for sure, Scott, this is Heath. We are \u2013 the numbers in Q2 were very consistent with what we have seen in the past both on the absolute gross pricing as well as the spread that we would see in this environment. Scott Graham : That\u2019s great. And maybe more specific to Allison\u2019s questions earlier, is there something that you think in the second half that you guys could close? Anything you are maybe in the further down the funnel that you would say maybe we can get another nice size deal closed in the second half? Andy Silvernail : Yes, listen, Scott. We are \u2013 I will give you an unfulfilling answer and that is that we are always in different levels of diligence for a variety of different things and some things break our way and some things don\u2019t and we will see, but you would expect the process that we have followed historically would be consistent with what we would do for the remainder of this year and going forward. Scott Graham : Yes, unfulfilling. Okay, thanks. Andy Silvernail : Thank you, Scott. Scott Graham : Thank you, guys. Operator : The next question is from the line of Andrew Bohra with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your questions. Mr. Bohra, your line is open for questions. Bhupender Bohra : Hey, good morning Andy and Pete. Andy Silvernail : Good morning. Bhupender Bohra : A question on the fourth quarter here, you guys mentioned as we looked \u2013 we are looking at like core sales decline in the first half and core sales is expected to improve in the second half now, that is more like fourth quarter driven here. Could you give us some more clarity from segment perspective, what is going to drive, which segment do you \u2013 we should think about? Andy Silvernail : To me to get to the $550 million for the fourth quarter? Bhupender Bohra : Yes. Andy Silvernail : Yes. So, again, the answer \u2013 let me touch two things and then I will get into the question. The first one is I think it\u2019s recognized that the $550 million is the identical number to what we just delivered. So, it\u2019s not like we are looking at a big giant step up here. So, I think it\u2019s important to note that we are not calling for some massive breakout and sequential economic performance here in the fourth quarter. That being said, we do have some visibility with some of the large chunks of business that Heath mentioned earlier that we see kind of moving us sequentially to that number. We do have some natural seasonality. And so when you put those two things together, it\u2019s just not a huge reach to get to that $550 million. And so is it $445 million, is it $555 million, plus or minus, but around that number it feels pretty good. Bhupender Bohra : Right. Yes, because the second quarter, you just mentioned about like oil and gas few projects which came in the last week of the quarter here, right. So I am just thinking about like are there any big buckets which you are looking at, whether it will be in FMT or HST or we have seen HST and FSD kind of organically weak here for the first two quarters and should we think about like some improvement in those markets or should we bank more on the FMT side of the business to kind of drive? Andy Silvernail : Our visibility in the fourth quarter is not dependent upon a lot of project activity. There are some natural things that would be more seasonal in nature and for instance the energy business, but not necessarily project activity in that regard. But if you go back over time, I think you would see that Q2 and Q4 largely would have similar profiles. Heath Mitts : Yes, Andrew, the pattern that we are talking about is not abnormal at all. Bhupender Bohra : Okay, okay. And another question on the capital spending here, somebody did mention that you lowered the CapEx here. Any particular segment or was it kind of broad-based here dependent on the dollar? Andy Silvernail : We are fully funding the things that we outlined for the year. We are moving forward with the investment in the facility in China that we have talked about. And we are actively investing in and pursuing investments. So, this is more, Andrew, just the tightening of expectations kind of given what we see, how people are going to absorb capital here through the balance of the year. Bhupender Bohra : Okay. And lastly just some questions on the incremental interest expense and the AWG step up inventory charge for the third quarter. I think you did give some numbers. I just wanted to clarify if you can give those again? Michael Yates : Hello, this is Mike Yates. In the third quarter, we will have a $2 million \u2013 approximately $2 million charge within cost of sales for the AWG step up fair value inventory charge. And for the back half of the year, interest expense will increase about $0.02, about $1 million each quarter as a result of the $200 million private placement that we completed in June. That\u2019s just the difference between the blended rate on the private placement of about 3.3% compared to the revolving credit facility rate, because we use the proceeds to repay down the revolvers. The revolver is about 1.5%, 1.55%. So, that delta drives about $0.02 of incremental interest over the back half. Bhupender Bohra : Okay, thanks a lot, Mike. Thank you, guys. Andy Silvernail : Thank you, Andrew. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brett Linzey with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead with your question. Brett Linzey : Hi, good morning. Andy Silvernail : Good morning, Brett. Brett Linzey : Just wanted to come back to fire and safety, I was a little bit surprised, down revenues against the down 11% comp certainly have some pressures in the rescue side of the business. Could you just sort of unbundle the different businesses and talk about those trends? And do you see any firming in some of the more challenged pieces as we look into the back half year? Andy Silvernail : Yes. So first of all, Brett, again, as I mentioned before the disconnect between the 9% down organic in orders, right and the 1% in sales, that\u2019s a very typical \u2013 that gap between those two things is not substantial. As you look across the businesses, again the places that have been \u2013 have sort of strength, dispensing showed strength. BAND-IT has continued to be weaker, right, whether because of the industrial exposure as compared to last year. Rescue has been weaker, really with the international rescue tools, marketplace continuing to be soft. And the fire business has been okay, generally, so when you kind of put that together, that\u2019s the bulk of the split. Brett Linzey : Okay. And then I guess as you look at the BAND-IT piece and the Rescue International, as we are looking at the back half here, do the comps start to ease or do you think that\u2019s sort of rolled into 2017? Andy Silvernail : Yes, they do to some degree. From a BAND-IT perspective, it gets easier really around the oil and gas side of the marketplace. Rescue is a little bit of a wildcard just because \u2013 it\u2019s been soft now. We are into 1.5 year here, frankly, of the rescue business, the international rescue business being soft. Mind you, the U.S. business has been terrific. And eDRAULIC 2.0 and now StrongArm have continued to be good pieces of business for us. It\u2019s really around countries that are buying through central purchasing that you have seen the weakness. Obviously, in the Middle East and in Indonesia, with a lot of the crisis that\u2019s going on around the world there. That\u2019s been the weak part. So, while theoretically there are easy comps, we are expecting that business to be pretty soft here through the back half of the year. Heath Mitts : I think on the organic fronts, the comps, specifically for fire and safety and diversified segment, again much, much easier in the fourth quarter. Andy Silvernail : In total? Heath Mitts : In total, for the segment. So, I think in the third quarter, we can still see some pressure just based on where the prior year came in. But in the fourth quarter, without much sequential improvement, we do see quite a step up on the organic side. Brett Linzey : Okay, great. And I just want to come back to AWG and Akron, you have owned the businesses for a couple of months now, you are kind of working through the integration process. I guess, what\u2019s the margin opportunity you see today? And then separately, as you look at some of the selling channels, top line opportunities as you pull through those different products, how you are thinking about the business and sort of the go forward here? Andy Silvernail : So I think, with both of them, we are targeting about a 500 basis point profit improvement over a 3-year period. And obviously, we would work to bring that forward as much as possible. So, the basic economics of both businesses look very, very similar to our original fire business. And our fire business has meaningfully better overall economics that we think we can get close to with both Akron and the AWG over time. So, we are going to see a nice improvement in profitability and therefore driving returns on capital both those businesses from that. On the commercial side, the benefits on the commercial side are certainly in the U.S., as you look at the Akron business and our existing fire business, there is a lot of channel overlap, but I think there is a lot of opportunity to bring a better overall product portfolio to market. And to be able to do that in a way where we are bringing kind of all of the high value content from a flow perspective to the OEMs and to the marketplace. So, I think there is definitely some benefit there. In terms of AWG, AWG and Akron were both the leading players in their respective markets. And so you got the number one player in the U.S., the number one player in Europe. There are some materials in technology differences that will take some time to play through. You are not going to just willy-nilly integrate things that don\u2019t make sense. You want to be really sensible about that. And the channel overlap is a little bit less there. Although there are some nice benefits of having it within the Lucas umbrella, AWG within our Lucas umbrella, which is our principal rescue tool business. Brett Linzey : Okay, great. And if I could just sneak one more in here, so have restructured the business to some degree, you have done a real good job on productivity. If we do see some modest inflection within this industrial complex, I guess how should we think about incremental margins relative to the 30 to 35 that you guys have talked about in that sort of modest improvement environment? Andy Silvernail : There is absolutely no reason that we wouldn\u2019t achieve those targets. If you assume that you move from what has been a flattish world to a 2% to 3% world, there is no reason that we wouldn\u2019t be able to deliver at those rates. If you saw something that was better than that, say 3% to 4%, I believe for some period of time, you would see even higher incrementals. Brett Linzey : It makes sense. That\u2019s all I had. I appreciate it. Andy Silvernail : Thanks, Brett. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your questions. Matthew Mishan : Yes, good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Andy Silvernail : Good morning. Matthew Mishan : So, you call it \u2013 it looks like you can call like $6 million in the quarter from those delayed energy projects. And I am assuming those were not included in guidance for the second quarter. And you still \u2013 even with those, did you still came in at a decline of 1% organically versus flat guidance? Does that mean the quarter was actually coming in worse leading up to those orders at the very end of the quarter? And how does that reconcile with the commentary where you are seeing kind of stability in some level of improvement? Andy Silvernail : Yes. So Matthew, I think you are mixing and matching a few things. So, let me separate them out. The first one is around those projects specifically. About half of that $6 million we had baked into our expectations and about half wasn\u2019t. And obviously, you guys wouldn\u2019t have any insight to that going into the quarter and so you are talking $3ish million or so of revenue that was a little bit better than expected plus or minus. In terms of that relative to the commentary of stability, you are really talking about two very different markets, right. One is the projects we are talking about were principally around energy and things that had set in backlog for quite some time. And the comments around stability were really around the North American industrial markets. So, two different pieces that I think is important to distinguish. Matthew Mishan : Okay, got it. And then what are you hearing from your life science customers around the timing of spending from kind of increased NIH budgets and what they are spending on? Andy Silvernail : Yes, nothing that\u2019s material. That\u2019s been a good news story for that part of the business here for a couple of years now as spending has started to increase. As you know, the aggregate spending itself is not that big a deal, right. So, how much is being spent by NIH is not that big a deal. It tends to be a catalyst for the industry, right. So, the $35 billion or so dollars that gets spent by NIH and it gets distributed incredibly broadly across the scientific complex in and of itself does not drive a lot of business. It is really what it does to catalyze the industry around research and around production. So in my view, it continues to be a net positive, but I don\u2019t think it is something that\u2019s an inflection. Matthew Mishan : Alright, got it. And last question for me is I think you brought down your net share repurchase to 1% to 2% for the full year, is that a function of where the stock is or is that a function of the acquisition pipeline? Andy Silvernail : The pipeline has been pretty good already with AWG and with Akron, in total. We have put a decent amount of money to work. And we have laid out a very clear capital deployment strategy for people and how we have thought about share repurchase and the combination of those two things are part of our discipline. Matthew Mishan : Alright, thank you very much. Andy Silvernail : Thanks, Matt. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jim Giannakouros with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your questions. And Mr. Giannakouros, your line is open for questions. Jim Giannakouros : Hey, sorry I was on mute there. Good morning, guys. Andy Silvernail : Hey, Jim. Jim Giannakouros : Sorry, if I missed the numbers to this. But just to better understand the trends that you are seeing in HST, if that segment is roughly two-thirds life science, etcetera, one-third industrial, what are the order growth trends that you are seeing in each of those buckets that gets you to that kind of flat that you printed for 2Q or what are the growth expectations for each bucket in the second half? Just to better understand what the orders of magnitude that are contributing to your outlook in HST? Thanks. Andy Silvernail : So Jim, we don\u2019t break it down that finitely. But just to give you some kind of bigger picture, about half of it, you would call industrial and about half you would call truly scientific. And so you can kind of piece together that the scientific stuff is up low to mid single-digit generally and the industrial stuff is kind of down the same, plus or minus in the quarter. And I think what you get is you get some firming from the industrial side in the back half and about the same kind of rates on the scientific side as you think about the back half. And that those are very general numbers. Jim Giannakouros : Fair enough. That\u2019s in line with how I was thinking about the scientific side just given with the OE guys are saying. One follow-up if I may just not to harp on Europe, but just to get a better understanding if you can provide it on the end markets, whether you said water is a source of strength, I believe you cited Europe as well as North America. But in Europe specifically, just given your views that Brexit just adds another layer of uncertainty, where would you say is \u2013 are you more uncertain or there is more risk, would you say that muni and commercial are just as much at risk or maybe muni-related type of spending might be a little bit more stickier? Andy Silvernail : I think in the short-term, I think the muni spend generally tends to have more stickiness to it, Jim, just because the budget cycles move much slower. And I think that\u2019s true in Europe as well as in the United States. So with big economic shifts of any kind, municipal tends to be a laggard in one way or the other, right, whether it\u2019s a positive laggard or a negative laggard. That being said, the concern, right, that I have, that concern around contagion, if that were to play itself out, it\u2019s going to be a tough world there, right. And so far, there aren\u2019t kind of screaming indicators of that being the case. But obviously, we are watching pretty closely. If we start to see it unraveling, if we start to see two or three other significant countries decide that they no longer want to play. Our view is that, that gets messy pretty fast. Jim Giannakouros : Fantastic. Thank you. Andy Silvernail : Thanks, Jim. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Walter Liptak with Seaport Global. Please go ahead with your questions. Walter Liptak : Hi, thanks. Good morning, guys. Andy Silvernail : Hey, Walt. Walter Liptak : I wanted to ask about kind of the follow-up to an earlier question about the new products and I will phrase it this way. You guys have done a great job with the operational performance in getting margin even with revenue declines the last 1.5 years or so. Are there programs in place for organic growth? And I guess I am asking about the processes that might be different from the past for new products new markets that might help you get more revenue growth in this very slow growth environment? Andy Silvernail : Walter, I would not put it in the phrase of programs or processes. It\u2019s what we do, right. And it\u2019s just how you run the businesses. And there is no doubt that the economic conditions have been challenging and we have faced that too. But when you lay us out against our peer group and I actually think we \u2013 even though I am not very thrilled with the performance, I think we have performed pretty well organically, even though it\u2019s been a challenge. And if you kind of layer that out against our peer group that we call it in our proxy or really the peer group that we get compared against, I think you would see that we have pretty favorable results both organically and in total. That being said, how we think about this, Walt, is we have got about two-thirds of our businesses that I have squarely put in the growth category. And in our businesses that we are going to continue to very, very aggressively fund and drive for organic performance. And then we have got about 25% that I have put in the world of fix where there is something substantially that needs to be changed in those businesses to position them for future growth and then you got some stuff that\u2019s kind of in the middle that you are really asking to hold their own in the marketplace and certainly win, but you are not asking for giant ambitions around growth. And so our process is really around differentiating where different businesses fit in that world and then investing and have expectations that are differential and that\u2019s how we think about our portfolio and that\u2019s how we think about driving performance. So \u2013 and those businesses that are in that fixed category, our expectation is really around total profit growth, right, expansion in margin and total profit growth. And those businesses that are in the growth category, it\u2019s around finding product in market entrants and application that you can drive it differentially. And so that\u2019s how we break it down and think of it not so much as a program or new process. Walter Liptak : Okay, got it. Okay, thank you. Andy Silvernail : Thanks, Walt. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Matt Summerville with Alembic Global. Please go ahead with your question. Matt Summerville : Thanks. Just a couple of things. First, just in terms of maybe talk about the underlying trends you are seeing as we think about bidding activity in oil, gas and chemical more of those process-oriented markets, just the absolute level, but also then the conversion rates that you are seeing now in terms of converting a bid to an order in an order to a shipment, forgetting the quarter end benefit that you guys have. If you can comment on that, that will be great? Andy Silvernail : Yes, sure. So Matt, as you know, we don\u2019t touch that very closely. It\u2019s a very, very, very small part of our business. You are talking 2%, 3% that plays in that world generally, yes, that\u2019s playing in that large scale bid world and so we don\u2019t have \u2013 we are not going to be the experts on visibility into that world. Except to say, for those places that we do touch it, there has not been a material increase, right. So, the benefits that we got at BAND-IT were around MRO as you saw kind of oil spike. In terms of the other small pieces where we play upstream, there has been no \u2013 nothing materially changed in overall activity rates. I know, rig counts have inched up here recently, but we haven\u2019t seen anything that would tell us that there is a significant turnaround on the near horizon. Matt Summerville : And then just lastly, you hit on this briefly with one of your recent responses, but how are you thinking about both the secular and cyclical factors that impact kind of the life sciences side of things and the water/muni side of things, what inning are we in, in each one of those? And I guess, this is more a question on not necessarily Q3, but just looking out over the next 12 to 18 months how to think about that? Andy Silvernail : So, Matt, when it comes to the life science side, the cycles tend to be driven more around new products than on kind of market demand. Market demand in many, many ways gets defined by new product introduction, right. So, as you are able to cure, to test, to develop new things with new technologies that tends to be the stimulant for demand around the life science world. And I think we are in a pretty good phase right now, where new products are launching. I think there is a pretty good cycle here in 2016, 2017. So, I expect it to be pretty decent. That being said, we have seen in the past as you get a bulk of new product introduction, sometimes you will see a quarter or so pause as they are ramping up to move through their channels. So, we keep an eye up for that. There is nothing that tells us that\u2019s eminent, but we definitely keep an eye up. But I think generally, we are still in the early to mid innings of that phase there. I think on the municipal side, Matt, we are still pretty early. And what I mean by that is you just got to remember how tight municipal spending was for so long. So, certainly in the Western world, what if you are in 2 years in to the expansion here for improvement and we think you have got another, at least 3 or so years, maybe even longer assuming you don\u2019t get a major macroeconomic shutdown. That would tighten budgets and that would tighten municipal spending, but there is still \u2013 there is a lot of backlog in municipal spending in the Western world right now. Matt Summerville : Great. Thanks a lot. Andy Silvernail : Thank you, Matt. Operator : The next question is from the line of Jim Foung with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead with your question. Jim Foung : Hi, good morning, Andy and Heath. Good quarter. Andy Silvernail : Hi, Jim. Thank you. Jim Foung : Just a couple of questions. So, on the Brexit impact, where would you see this, if the effects unfold not as good as expected? Andy Silvernail : Yes. So, I mean again, I am not as worried about the UK itself so to speak, because I feel like we are in a pretty good position where our \u2013 when you compare our revenue base and our cost base, I think we are in a pretty good spot. So, depending upon how dramatic currencies change, depending upon whether or not you start to see inflation in the UK, the places that you could see is we have got 5% of our business that\u2019s in the UK, you could see some inflation ramp up there, so you got to keep your head around that. And then the other partial there it\u2019s how demand switches patterns. I don\u2019t see a big issue with that again because of the hedges, the natural hedge that we have between where we build and where we sell. Again, Jim, I think the bigger concern for me is if this starts to roll itself through broader Europe. That\u2019s my bigger concern. Jim Foung : So you eventually just come down to the order rates, right. I mean, but you didn\u2019t see anything in the June order rate, right, because we saw kind of good numbers growing [indiscernible]? Andy Silvernail : We haven\u2019t seen anything yet. There is just a lot of noise. And so when you see that amount of noise and I am also realistic about the European Union. With everything that\u2019s going on, it\u2019s still \u2013 there is a lot of fragility to it. And a major player deciding it doesn\u2019t want to play anymore can have the effects of starting to unravel some pretty important pieces. Jim Foung : Are you currently seeing delay in potential orders where if we don\u2019t get the worst case scenario with Brexit some of these orders could... Andy Silvernail : Yes, Jim. No, we haven\u2019t seen anything yet. Jim Foung : Haven\u2019t seen anything, okay. And then just moving on just to the energy shipments, what drove the customers to take delivery in Q2? I mean, is it because of the confidence in the higher oil prices relative to the past or changing the budgets? Andy Silvernail : Ultimately, it\u2019s a little hard to tell. And these are things that require cash on hand and letter of credit, so nothing of note. Jim Foung : Okay, thank you very much. Andy Silvernail : Thank you, Jim. Operator : The next question is from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen & Company. Please go head with your questions. Joe Giordano : Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Andy Silvernail : Hey, how are you? Did we hit afternoon already? Joe Giordano : I guess we are getting there. Quick for me, I think you mentioned with Akron like a 500 basis point margin opportunity over the next 3 years. Would that get you to kind of where the segment is now or is that a little bit \u2013 gets you a little bit below where the second was? Andy Silvernail : It could be a little lower \u2013 to be a little lower, but it would be very attractive. Joe Giordano : Okay. And then just the capital deployment bent more recently towards Fire & Rescue, is that more indicative of just the valuation in that market or rather than like the necessarily the forward prospects, is that just where you are seeing the best long-term value based on what sellers are asking for? Andy Silvernail : Obviously, with both AWG and with Akron, we got \u2013 we bought the businesses at reasonable valuations. A lot of it has to do with what properties are available. And so obviously, with Akron, that was driven by the sellers need. And I think we have mentioned in the past, we had been talking to them and about that business for some time. And as they decided strategically what they needed to do, that really opened up the opportunity. And then of course, Akron was owned \u2013 excuse me, AWG was owned by a private equity firm. And as pieces and parts start to move in any one industry, it tends to catalyze other movement and that had been owned for a few years and whatnot and they had done some good things with it. And so I think our purchase of Akron probably started to open up that market a little bit and we were the natural buyer in both cases. Joe Giordano : It\u2019s another property of size in that market was to come available, is that something you pounce on just \u2013 you have put in a lot of capital into those markets over last year? Andy Silvernail : Personally, I don\u2019t see that happening. There is nothing \u2013 there is lots of little things, but there is nothing that would fit that definition today. So, I wouldn\u2019t expect it today. I mean, obviously, it\u2019s the greatest thing in the world at a very cheap price were to come up. Certainly, we would consider it. But as it looks right now, I don\u2019t see anything kind of on the immediate horizon like you have described. Joe Giordano : Well, thanks guys. Appreciate it. Andy Silvernail : Yes. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I will turn the floor back to Andrew Silvernail for any closing remarks. Andy Silvernail : Well, thank you all very much. I appreciate the questions here today and I appreciate your interest in IDEX and the support of the business. When it\u2019s all said and done, the conditions that remain today are very similar to what we have seen in the past year or so, with some benefits of some industrial stability here in the United States that we saw in the quarter. But mostly, it\u2019s really around the team\u2019s ability to execute and that\u2019s what I am most proud of is our ability to continue to drive performance in an environment that is still murky. And so I really appreciate my team and I thank them for all their performance. And I look forward to talking to you all again here in 90 days. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect your lines at this time.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Michael Yates, Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer for IDEX Corporation. Thank you. You may begin. Mike Yates : Thank you, Melissa. Good morning, everyone. This is Mike Yates, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer for IDEX Corporation. Thank you for joining us for our discussion of the IDEX third quarter financial highlights. Last night, we issued a press release outlining our company's financial and operating performance for the three-month period ending September 30, 2016. A press release, along with the presentation slides to be used during today's webcast, can be accessed on our company's Web site at www.idexcorp.com. Joining me today is Andy Silvernail, our Chairman and CEO. The format for our call today is as follows. We will begin with Andy providing an overview of the third quarter financial results. We will then provide an update on our markets and geographies and discuss our capital deployment. We will then walk you through the operating performance within each of our segments for the third quarter. And, finally, we will wrap up with our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2016. Following our prepared remarks, we will then open the call for your questions. If you should need to exit the call for any reason, you may access a complete replay beginning approximately two hours after the call concludes by dialing the toll-free number 877-660-6853 and entering the conference ID 13620008 or you simply may log on to our company's home page for the webcast replay. As we begin, a brief reminder, this call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the Safe Harbor language in today's press release and in IDEX's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I will turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Andy Silvernail. Andy Silvernail : Thanks Mike. Hey, I appreciate everybody joining us here for our third quarter conference call. As we get into the details here, I want to lay out a couple of very important messages. In the face of continuing macroeconomic challenges, I think there are three critical things to take away. The first is our execution has been outstanding. Whether it's profit execution or cash execution or focusing on our critical niche markets in our profit pools, our teams have done really an exceptional job around that. Second, I think we can note the power of our disciplined capital deployment, and I will go into that in detail as we walk through the call here. And, three, we are extremely well-positioned with our balance sheet and our cash flows to continue with our disciplined capital deployment to drive total shareholder return. And so as we go through the discussion today, I think those are the three key messages to keep in mind. In the quarter, we saw a ratable up tick in orders throughout the quarter, as we did in the second quarter. We delivered 2% organic growth, and that's the first time we've seen that in six quarters. And overall, the results were strong. Our orders were up 9%; our sales were up 5%. Again, organic orders were up 2%; organic sales were down 2%. We had adjusted EPS of $0.92, which was up $0.03 or 3%. But please keep in mind that included a $4.6 million inventory step-up charge related to AWG and the SFC acquisitions. Our adjusted operating margin was 20.9%. That was down 60 basis points from last year, but it was negatively impacted by that step-up that I just noted of $4.6 million. In the fourth quarter, we are going to have a remaining $5.2 million of step-up for the SFC acquisition, and I will go through that in more detail. But I think it is important to note that in the quarter, we saw an impact of about $0.04 a share in step-up, and it impacted our operating margin by 90 basis points. In the quarter, we had tremendous cash production $125 million of operating cash production and $114 million of free cash flow, which I will note is a record. We did close the two acquisitions in the quarter, AWG and SFC. AWG was on July 1 and SFC was on August 31. And we are delighted to have both of them as part of the IDEX family. And I will talk a minute more about how they fit and our outlook for those businesses. Additionally, we divested two non-strategic product lines in the quarter, and we did the third here in the first part of October. We also made the decision to utilize $125 million of our overseas cash to partially fund the acquisitions. That did come at a cost of about $5.2 million in the quarter and it raised our effective tax rate to 29.6% versus our guidance of 27%. That had a $0.03 negative impact on our adjusted EPS for the quarter. And, again, I'm going to -- in just a few minutes, I'm going to take some time and walk you through the puts and takes so you can get a clean sense of what our operating earnings were for the quarter and what you should expect going forward. Before I do that, however, let me talk a little bit about what we're seeing in our core markets and geographies. Really the trends remain the same from what we have been talking about for the last three quarters or so. In our energy world, demand does remain weak. It impacts our energy, our banded and ceiling solutions platforms, but it is certainly no worse than we have seen at any one time, and we have talked about stability in some of those markets. And that goes true for our industrial world, especially in industrial distribution. We have seen stability; we talked about that in the second quarter. And we have seen sequential stability from Q1 until today in certainly in our day rate business. On the ag side, ag prices continue to be depressed. We did see a little bit of upside here in the quarter for the first time in quite some time. And although we are certainly not calling an improvement here, we do believe that we've seen a bottom. Life science and scientific fluidics continues to outperform. This has been a great story for us for quite some time and it will be going forward. Our core markets of bio, analytical instrumentation and IBD are all doing well. With that said there has been some news lately about what's going on in the genetic sequencing world, so I want to take a second and just address that. First and foremost, that is a great segment of the market that is going to grow double-digit for the foreseeable future and is going to have legs for a long time to come. And so, we like our position in that market, we like our -- where we are positioned with customers in that market. But also remember we don't have a single customer within IDEX that represents more than 2% of our sales. And so there has been some -- we have seen some commentary lately suggesting that it is substantially higher than that, but I just want to make sure that we were accurate : that no customer represents more than 2% of our sales. We are bullish about these markets as we go forward, and we will continue to make bets aligned with those markets. Municipal, it remains solid, and we do expect to see modest increases going forward, as we've noted in the past discussions. Around certain regions, North America, the story here is really around what is happening around industrial and energy markets, principally around industrial distribution. And we expect that to be, as I just mentioned a minute ago, stable, but really no signs yet of recovery. Europe, obviously with what's going on in the U.K., it brings some volatility. We haven't seen any direct impact to our business in Europe. It has been positive for us this year, especially around our dispensing and our water businesses. In China -- or Asia, rather, China has been muted. And India has been a very good new story for us, especially around our fire, our rescue, our energy and our dispensing businesses. All right. Let me pivot for a moment and move from markets to talk about capital deployment because that's been a big piece of our story here in 2015 and now 2016. If you think about our value creation model, it is very much supported by a balanced and disciplined capital deployment strategy. And we're going to fully fund organic growth. We've always made a commitment to do that, and we will continue to do that. We are going to pay consistent shareholder dividends. We will buy back shares when it makes sense to create value, and we are going to focus on executing in M&A. We've got a great balance sheet, strong free cash flows and a good acquisition pipeline as we think about the balance of 2016 and certainly into the future. On M&A, we have put over $0.5 billion to work here this year including AWG, SFC and also Akron earlier in the year. If you think about AWG and Akron in particular, it has helped us build a terrific fire and safety platform. We have channel opportunities, we have innovation opportunities and we certainly have cost opportunities to drive this portfolio into the future. We also completed the acquisition of SFC Koenig on August 31. That cost us \u20ac217 million and we have got a great business here based in Switzerland. They are a global leader around highly engineered metal-per-metals seals. It really focuses on high pressure and high temperature and transportation to hydraulic markets, but it is very scalable. As I think about opportunities in their core business to take market share and in adjacent businesses around aerospace and medical, we have a terrific business in SFC. And we're delighted to have all three as part of the IDEX family. Other elements of capital deployment, this year we have spent $55 million buying back 739,000 shares at an average price of $74 a share. So I think we've executed that well. As I mentioned before, we are going to fully fund organic growth. We've taken an aggressive segmentation to our portfolio thinking about where we have great advantages in niches and where the profit pools are really attractive. And we continue to drive investment in that for above-market growth. And then finally on dividends, we have told you for a long time now our goal is 30% to 35% of net income, and we will continue to execute around that. The last element I want to talk about with capital deployment is really the position of our balance sheet. And I think this is critical as you think about our ability to drive total shareholder return for the long-term. As I noted earlier, we utilized $125 million of our global cash to fund our Q3 acquisitions. This did drive a higher than expected quarterly tax rate, but we thought it was prudent, given where the cash sat around the world, our ability to put money to work in attractive return versus sitting idle. And I think it's important to note that our long-term debt balance increased only $45 million when you compare September 30 to June 30, even while we invested $288 million of capital into AWG and SFC in the third quarter. And so we sit today at only around 2 times leveraged on an EBITDA basis -- on a gross EBITDA basis and we've got plenty of capital availability. We've got $450 million of revolver. And if you think about the last three years, we have averaged about $335 million of free cash flow. And we've got $240 million still sitting on our balance sheet. So as we think about our ability in the next three years to deploy $1 billion of capital, I feel very comfortable that we are able to do that. As I mentioned before, we have divested three product lines in 2016. Two of those happened in the third quarter and one just at the beginning of the fourth quarter. And this is really an emphasis around optimizing our portfolio. We have talked a little bit about this in the future. These are not big businesses, nor do we expect to divest large chunks of business. But we do want to always think about positioning our product portfolio as we go forward. I think it's important to note if you take the acquisitions that we've done and the small divestitures that we've done, I want you to think about the impact that we expect going forward into 2017. The bottom line is that we expect about $0.25 of incremental earnings in 2017 from the combination of our acquisitions minus the small impacted divestitures. So, again, $0.25 of incremental impact in 2017 compared to 2016. All right. With that, let's move to Slide 4, and we will start to talk about the results and then I will get into the segments. So, in the third quarter, we had orders were up $530 million -- or, excuse me, $530 million, up 9% -- 2% organically. And, again, that was the first improvement we have seen since the first quarter of 2015. Revenue was also $530 million. That was up 5%, but down 2% organically. And then operating margin for the quarter was at 20.5%. However, as I mentioned before, it was at 20.9% when you think about the net loss on the divestitures. And that was down 60 basis points year-over-year, but it was due to a 90-basis-points of pressure from the fair value inventory step-up that I walked you through earlier. Cash flow again was a great story -- $125 million of cash from operations, $114 million of free cash flow. That was 163% of net income and that was up $9 million, or 9%, from last year. Net income was $70 million. That delivered GAAP EPS of $0.91. If you take into account the loss in the divestitures, adjusted EPS was $0.92 and again, up $0.03 or up 3% from last year. All right. As I mentioned at my opening, I want to give you some color and some detail around the puts and takes of the quarter because I know there was a lot out there. And I think it's important to be able to link back to our guidance. We had guided adjusted EPS of $0.92 -- excuse me, $0.90 to $0.92. If you take the high-end of our guidance, here is the puts and takes that you should consider. We had $0.02 of pressure from the SFC acquisition. That was $0.03 of fair value inventory step-up offset by $0.01 of goodness from operations. We had $0.03 of pressure from the additional tax expense that I mentioned from our higher tax rate. We had $0.02 of favorability from FX. And we had a $0.03 -- overall, we had a $0.03 operational beat. So a way to look at this from a clean perspective on the operating power of the business in the quarter is we had a $0.95 operating quarter and we improved operating margins on an apples-for-apples basis. So as you think about what we delivered for the quarter, that is the clean view of what we delivered for the quarter. Okay, let's turn now to the segment discussions. I'm on Slide 6, and let's start with fluid metering. In the quarter, orders decreased 1% and organic sales were flat. Operating margin increased 340 basis points. That was driven primarily by the fair value inventory step-up that we had last year when we bought Alpha and that was a $2.5 million impact in the third quarter of last year. Our energy markets, I have already talked about generally. A little bit more detail. Aviation remains good for us. Obviously, the low fuel price and what we're doing to develop channels is helping us improve that market, but certainly being offset by what we're seeing in the mobile markets and in LPG, which remains challenged. Water has been a good story for us. The municipal markets remain solid, especially around water services. Industrial, I talked about quite a bit already. We are seeing sequential stability. Day rates are holding. I think that the biggest thing that we are seeing is that is a negative is we have seen projects -- not big projects because, as you know, we typically are not involved in big projects. But whether it is in FMT or the industrial aspects of HST, we have seen projects pushed out and delayed and/or canceled. And that is putting some pressure on the forward-looking point of view in terms of sales in the fourth quarter of this year. Ag, as I said, it still remains soft, but we have seen some positive movement here in the fourth quarter. Again, while we like the sustained improvement, we are certainly not ready to call it a significant turn. And so I think we're going to see a little bit better results than we've seen here in the past, but -- and we have hit a bottom, but I don't think it's too early to call for a major upturn. With that, let's turn to Slide 7, and we will talk about health and science. As I mentioned before, the life sciences and the scientific markets remain positive. These are businesses that have been on a nice growth trajectory here for quite some time and we're excited about where we sit in the marketplace. That has been offset by the industrial-facing portions of that segment. So about half of HST is traditionally scientific and life science related, and about half has an industrial aspect to it. And so we are seeing the offsets of the strength and the weakness in those markets. We did see 4% organic order growth in HST in the quarter. We did have organic sales that were down 1%. Operating margin decreased 140 basis points really from everything I've talked about with the fair value inventory step-up with SFC. In scientific fluidics, again, continues to be strong. The major end-markets are doing well and exceeding expectations. The three markets of analytical instrumentation, bio and IVD have all delivered at or above our expectations, and we expect that to remain throughout this year and continue to have a good story into next year. Ceiling solutions -- the scientific part of that that is going into semiconductor is doing well. The part that is in oil and gas obviously has been challenged. And we love what SFC brings to this part of our business. Industrial side, I already mentioned the weakness that's been there. We did see some weakness specifically around our industrial-facing businesses in HST, our gas, our micro pump business and the industrial parts of material process. And so we are keeping a close eye on those things going forward. And then finally, in MPT, our material process business, the pharma story continues to be good. But the longer-cycle CapEx has seen some pressure, as I mentioned before. All right. I'm on our final segment; I'm on Slide 8, and that's diversified. Organic orders increased 4% in the quarter, but it was down 6% in organic sales. Margins were down 750 basis points. They are exactly what we expected to happen. You had the impact of the step up from AWG and you also had the mixed impact that we would expect from new businesses coming in that have more amortization and bring down the overall portfolio mix. Going forward, we think an op margin in the 25% range is where we will sit today, but you should expect us to improve that over time as we bring AWG and Akron and those margins forward. We have talked about a 500 basis point improvement over time and there's no reason to believe that that won't happen. Our integration is going -- on both of those are just going well and we're happy with the progress. In terms of dispensing, it's been a fantastic story. The business continues to outperform. X-Smart has been a huge winner for us in this business. We are executing well in all three major regions and we expect that to be a good news story going forward. In fire and rescue, obviously the big news is bringing Akron and AWG into that portfolio, driving the synergies in the business. We are seeing some nice improvements already. Our integration is going well. We did here in early in the fourth quarter announce internally that we are doing some restructuring around facility consolidation and driving the benefits of this business. So you will see a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter, and we are doing exactly what we said we would do. In terms of Band-It, we are seeing strength in transportation. That business offset by weakness in oil and gas are really the same headwinds we've seen in the past. But they have just done, once again, a terrific job on profit execution, focusing on niche markets where they can go get some growth and we really like this business for the long-term. All right. I am on our final slide, I'm on Slide 9, and I want to talk about the fourth quarter and full-year guidance. So, in the fourth quarter, we estimate EPS to be in the range of $0.92 to $0.94. That allows us to maintain the midpoint of our guidance and for the year, $3.72 to $3.74 despite the headwinds that we've talked about. So, there has been a little bit of confusion about, again, the underlying operating earnings, so let me walk you through that a little bit. So we're guiding $0.92 to $0.94 of adjusted EPS. That's going to include about $0.02 of pressure from the SFC acquisition. So that's -- when we think about that, you are going to have some incremental step-up, and then, you're going to have the operating impact. So we're going to get about $0.03 of operating goodness from SFC in the quarter, but it's going to be offset by $0.05 of inventory step-up. So there's going to be $0.02 negative. And we're going to get another -- approximately $0.01 of pressure from the divestitures. So, again, while we're guiding $0.92 to $0.94, the operating -- underlying operating capability is more like $0.95 to $0.97. And you can see how that impacts the quarter and, again, what that looks like for real operating capability for the year. A few more modeling items. We expect organic revenue growth of approximately 1% in the quarter. Operating margins will be 19.5%, but, again, that includes the $5.2 million of step-up. So we're going to have a nice, strong operating profit margin on an ongoing basis as we think about the fourth quarter and exit rate into the year. You should expect the tax rate to be back to its 27% rate, so not at the 29.6% that you saw this quarter. All right. For the full year, we expect organic revenue to be down 1% and adjusted operating margin to come in at about 20.5%. So, really outstanding profit margin given all the things that we have discussed. We expect full-year CapEx to come in at $40 million, free cash flow to be about 120% of net income. And in total, we will reduce our share count by about 1% for the year, given what we have already executed in the year. As always, as we think about our guidance, we don't include anything from future acquisitions or divestitures, any charges related to pension settlements or any costs related to restructuring actions. So with that, let me turn it over to the operator, and we will open it up for questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo Advisors. Please proceed with your questions. Allison Poliniak : Hi, guys. Good morning. Andy Silvernail : Hi, Allison. Allison Poliniak : Andy, could you delve into the health and science a little bit more? I would say I guess one of your customers was talking about concerns of oversupply and obviously potentially NIH funding slowing, but obviously orders were strong. So I'm just trying to reconcile the differences in those comments. Andy Silvernail : Yes. So I want to be careful here. We never talk about any specific customer, right? Allison Poliniak : Sure. Andy Silvernail : So I think that generally if you step back and you look at that landscape. So whether it is -- you are looking at genetic sequencing, analytical instrumentation generally, in vitro diagnostics more broadly, we are seeing the trends continuing to be very good. And you see -- if you look at sequencing in particular, that is still going to be a double-digit growth market. It's a market that is going through change as it's moving from, call it, a research tool to a production tool or a commercial tool. And so you will see changes in the landscape there. But we are positioned exceptionally well across that customer base in that market. And, of course, our traditional markets in IVD and analytic instrumentation. What you can see across the board is strength. And if you look at funding that is expected, assuming that the funding trends that we have seen happen that's actually a pretty good news story. So when it's all said and done, as I look at those markets, over the next certainly year and more into the future, I think that's a very good news story for us. Allison Poliniak : That's great. Thanks. And then obviously, you guys have done very well on the capital deployment side, deployed a lot towards acquisitions this year. Just with the prolonged industrial malaise that we've experienced, have you noticed any sort of changes in the M&A environment? Whether people -- especially smaller business are trying -- are becoming more active in terms of setting themselves up for sale? Pricing declines or anything of that nature? Andy Silvernail : I don't think there's been a meaningful break yet in that. Meaning that some of the more expensive assets, are they -- are we seeing a more reasonable perspective on valuation. I wouldn't say that yet. When you look at the things that are in the energy markets, a lot of people -- they had outside the expectation some time ago, and now they're struggling with the reality of their operating capability and so they are not ready to part with those businesses and depressed multiples. But our pipeline looks like it has looked for a long time, right? So it's entirely a cultivated pipeline. We have been working on it actively. And so that really doesn't change quarter-to-quarter very much for us. What changes is the activity from the -- really the auction world. And what I would say is that from the auction world, that has slowed down here recently in the last two quarters. But that is not the principal piece of how we think about M&A anyway. But I do expect there to be more activity going forward in our marketplace as people rectify what their operating capabilities really are and prices. So we will keep working at the way we've done it and try to drive it at the same level that you would expect us to. Allison Poliniak : Great. Thanks so much. Andy Silvernail : Thanks Allison. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Steven Winoker : Thanks and good morning, Andy and Mike. Andy Silvernail : Good morning. Mike Yates : Good morning. Steven Winoker : Just a couple or a few quick questions. First, the exit rate for Q4, when you're thinking about that looking forward and talking about 1%, we had talked last quarter about the reasonableness of the expectations at the time that you might hit a 4% organic growth in the quarter. And the early reads if you think about it, I guess we talked about rescue tools, X-Smart, oil and gas, distribution. Maybe just give us a better sense for your Q4 read now. What are the biggest drivers of that change? Andy Silvernail : You mean looking at kind of a 3% or 4% up versus a 1% up? Is that what you mean, Steve? Steven Winoker : Yes, yes. Yes, exactly. Andy Silvernail : The biggest thing in there is really the day rates are actually -- are very much what we have looked at. There's not a lot of change in there. But when you think of things that have a bigger CapEx component to it, you are seeing those things get pushed out. And those aren't a big piece of our overall business. But they are -- if you look at the marketplace, and it doesn't really matter what segment you look in, they are absent right now. And so what I view is happening is kind of continued pause and hesitancy around anything with a larger ticket item associated with it. That is the biggest change. But if you look at general day rates, that looks like it has looked like for a long time. Steven Winoker : Okay, okay. And then if I sort of extend that -- I'm not asking for you guys to do this yet, but if I take the 1% exit -- 1% for the quarter, and talk about 1% to 2% organic next year, you guys usually talk about like a 30% to 35% incremental on 3% growth. So if I take 25% to 30% here, that would normally give me another $0.09 or $0.10 on the midpoint plus the -- almost the full $0.25 that you mentioned because there will be some overlap as that goes organic. That still gets me kind of 8% to 10% EPS growth next year. Am I missing any kind of big movers in either direction there? Andy Silvernail : No. I do think right when we come out with our guidance for the quarter, is it -- the pivot is going to be what do you think the underlying industrial growth rates are going to be, right? So your logic -- I understand your logic. It's not dissimilar to how we're thinking about it. I'm not prepared to make that call here today, but I think your logic is sound. Steven Winoker : Okay. Then one last just technical question, maybe more for Mike, I guess. Just help me understand why you didn't just borrow the money given interest rates today instead of repatriating back with the tax penalty and your low leverage levels. Mike Yates : Sure. Well, we've got -- went ahead and made a decision to bring the money back from all over the globe really to get the benefit today and optimize our balance sheet and to get it out of some of the areas in the world where -- we did bring about $50 million out of China, actually. So we wanted to get that money out of China, and it made a lot of sense to us. And there was -- that was the real driver in some of the costs that we incurred in the quarter. Steven Winoker : Okay, that makes more sense. Thank you. I will pass it on. Andy Silvernail : You bet. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Scott Graham : Hey, good morning, Andy. Good morning, Mike. Very nice quarter. Andy Silvernail : Thank you. Good morning, Scott. Scott Graham : I just want to maybe ask a previous question a little bit differently around organic growth. Maybe kind of getting to the exit rate is the endgame. But more importantly for the full quarter, if you are expecting organic up about 1% in the fourth quarter and we were kind of down 2% this quarter, could you maybe tell us the segments where you see that delta coming from? Andy Silvernail : It's -- so there actually isn't a lot of puts and takes. You've got some pretty consistent performance. We are not seeing one thing driving major differences. That being said, if you kind of look at how it's flowing, we've got about 2% incremental order growth in the quarter. And -- so I think we are in a pretty good position relative to delivering on the quarter, but it will be driven by the day rate business. Mike, anything you'd add? Mike Yates : No. I think SFC is a little stronger in Q4, that there's some strength there in the forecast. So that's part of it. Scott Graham : Let me maybe -- if I could just paraphrase this, sort of the better markets are kind of staying better and the weaker markets are getting last weak. Mike Yates : Well, I think -- I wouldn't say they're getting less week. I would just say they're stable. Now, they are getting less weak on a -- as you start to look at year-over-year comparisons. Scott Graham : Yes, that's what I mean. Yes. Mike Yates : But from a sequential standpoint, things are looking like they have looked like for quite some time. Scott Graham : I'm with you. My second question is maybe something we have -- I hope to get back to something we haven't talked about in a while. And your driving of the margin continues to impress. I guess in the past, you guys used to talk about a certain dollar level of productivity savings. And I know you think about that a little bit differently now, Andy. But if we -- for the sake of modeling, one of the things that I talked about with Heath from time to time was something north of $30 million, south of $40 million of productivity has been kind of last couple year goal. Is that still in the realm? Andy Silvernail : Well, I think -- how we've talked about it for a long time here now, Scott, is you start the year with, we'll call it, natural inflation. And today, given the kind of material prices, that is just not a big number right now. But you go into the year with just wage inflation and basic overhead inflation, it looks like kind of $15 million or so -- could be $15 million to $20 million, right? So to hold your own, you've got to cover that. That is the starting bogie. And then to drive incremental profitability and margin expansion, that's where you start to have to get north of $20 million. And that's been our consistent goal historically is to be able to drive productivity so we are getting net benefit. And so that's why we have always talked about our ability to drive incremental margins even in a low-growth environment. So even if you have a single -- a low single-digit organic growth environment, when you think about our ability to continue to get price, we would expect to see margin expansion. Mike Yates : And that allows price then, Scott, to flow through if we can get productivity to offset inflation and material inflation. Scott Graham : Yes, no, I get it. My number was a gross number, so I think we are on the same page. Thanks a lot. Andy Silvernail : You bet, Scott. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Nathan Jones : Good morning, guys. Andy Silvernail : Hi, Nathan. Good morning. Nathan Jones : Andy, I wonder if we could try and parse out a little bit more into the industrial end markets and where you have seen maybe things be better or less bad, and where you have seen things be maybe a little bit worse. I know it's hard seeing that a lot of it goes through distribution, but just any color you can provide there. Andy Silvernail : One of the surprising things in this marketplace is once we've got past the steep drop in the energy-related markets, then what you saw happen was this ripple effect that went across the general industrial landscape. And so it is a little bit of an unusual situation right now where you are seeing performance across the industrial landscape all look pretty similar, right? So if you were at look at, say, our gas business, our Viking business, Warren Rupp, Band-It, things that are kind of -- that sit centrally -- and I'm going to call it general industrial. It is surprising how evenly split across those different markets the malaise is. And so, again, we had to get past that commodity-driven issues. But I think one of the signals that that sends to me Nathan is, again, back to this -- I'm going to call this just -- it's a big pause that has been out there for quite some time. And people are looking for a catalyst. And so we see it up and down the supply chain. We see it from our customers back through how we are behaving and our supply chain. And everybody is at that pause, and you see it from how capital is being deployed, meaning big CapEx, to the interval of orders. So, where in the past you would see larger blanket orders in annual time frames and quarterly, a lot of that stuff has just gone away, and you are now dealing in a world with general releases. And so it's -- again, it's surprising how general this is. Obviously, I think the energy markets are still worse than anything with some -- volatility depends upon the price of oil. But across the rest of the industrial landscape, it is surprisingly cohesive what we're seeing. Nathan Jones : Surprisingly cohesive in a non-cohesive market? So I guess maybe a little philosophical question for you here that maybe talks a little bit about 2017. We have seen a lack of volatility in oil price over the last probably six months. Prices are high, things are better. Is that something that you would expect to play through as that general ripple effect across general industrial markets in a more positive way, if we can maintain that kind of at least stable and maybe improving energy prices? Andy Silvernail : The short answer to it is yes. I think that the magnitude is what you have to put your finger on. So if you see oil prices back in this $50 to $60 range, it's going to be a slow roll of how that impacts things over time. So you will get the impact of production happening, you will get the wellhead impact, but how that moves its way through the general economy, I think, will take some time. Nathan Jones : Fair enough. Could you just give any more color on the different parts of the water markets that you are playing in? There's been a few reports. There is one out this morning from a water player with not such great results -- just what you are seeing there. Andy Silvernail : The water services is where the strength is right now. If you look at that for us -- so as an example, our ABS business has had terrific results. Some of that, I think, is taking share. Some of that has been a decent spend in the municipal space. I think -- I've said in the past that I thought municipal was going to have some good legs here for the foreseeable future. I still believe that to be true. But let's make sure that we are watching that quarter-to-quarter and what happens there. But for us, water services has been the brightest spot. Nathan Jones : All right. Thanks very much. Andy Silvernail : Thanks Nathan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Brett Linzey : Hi, good morning, guys. Andy Silvernail : Hi. Mike Yates : Good morning. Brett Linzey : Great quarter. Hey, just wanted to circle back on the completed deals for this year. Clearly strong free cash flow generation in the quarter. Do those deals come into the mix neutral to free cash flow conversion? Just trying to get a sense as to what the opportunity is outside margins and growth, but more focused on free cash flow and the 120% conversion you are doing this year and expectations going forward. Andy Silvernail : Yes, I think -- I will let Mike comment on it this also. So generally, right, these are going to be accretive to free cash flow conversion because of the amortization effect, right? So you are going to see that positively, generally. And they are all asset-light businesses. None of these businesses that we brought on are heavy capital in any way. And so you would expect to see across them really improvements in working capital over time. Improvements in margin. No need to inject big CapEx, so they should be positive. Is that fair, Mike? Mike Yates : Yes, that's right. Both -- all three deals help cash flow in the quarter, right? Because -- they may not help earnings because of the step up in the amortization, but on a cash basis, it definitely helps free cash flow in the quarter. Brett Linzey : Okay, no. That helps. And I guess shifting gears to FMT, obviously very good margins there. Are you able to order-rank the contributors of that margin expansion between net restructuring carryover, mix, leverage? It just seems like a very big number just trying to understand the parts of the different pieces there. Andy Silvernail : Yes, three things happening there, right? The first one is some of our bigger businesses within there, they did restructuring last year and we have certainly seen the benefits of that. Second is you've got some positive mix -- that's not a big number. But third, and importantly we talked a lot about the impact of our fixed businesses and we've had great results from that and a bunch of those businesses sitting in the FMT portfolio. And I really should say -- I should add price. We continue to get positive price in FMT and those -- so really it's four things, not three, that really matter and continue to drive margin expansion. Brett Linzey : Okay, great. I will pass along. Thanks, guys. Andy Silvernail : Thanks Brett. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Andy Silvernail : Hi, Deane. Mike Yates : Hi, Deane. Deane Dray : I was hoping to stay in fluid metering for a moment. And Andy, if you could expand on the point about some of the push-outs you saw in the quarter, maybe this was all part of that general pause and some hesitancy on bigger-ticket items, but some context there. And are these pushed into 4Q or is it uncertain when they would actually come through? Andy Silvernail : I think it's uncertain, Deane. I think we've talked about this in a number of the past quarters that we have seen things get pushed, delayed, whatever. And my view is that until you get some confidence back in, these things are going to sit out there -- so anything with big-ticket CapEx associated with them. So if you look at energy as an example, you're going to see -- if you assume that energy prices are in that $50 to $60 range, you will see excess capacity get absorbed in 2017, and then you will see new CapEx coming in, in 2018. And while it tends to be more cyclical than the rest of the general industrial, I think it's a good proxy for what we're seeing across the industrial landscape. Deane Dray : Okay. That's real helpful. Then just make sure we have got the modeling set up for the fourth quarter, you mentioned a couple different charges. So there's restructuring in fire and safety, and there's also going to be a pension charge? Andy Silvernail : That's right. That's correct. We haven't put our arms around it exactly what those will look like. But obviously, we will provide the detail. So we will do some restructuring, as we expected we would when we did those acquisitions. And the pension will play itself out here in the fourth quarter. Deane Dray : And that's a mix of cash and non-cash? Andy Silvernail : That is all cash. The pension will be cash. About 75% of it will be cash, and then the restructuring will be mostly cash also. Mike Yates : Yes, yes. Deane Dray : Got it. And just a last question -- any update on the CFO search? Any timing expectations? Andy Silvernail : Our general expectation is -- these things take six months or so. And so if you focus in around the end of January, some time into February that would be our expectation for finalizing it. Deane Dray : Great. Thank you. Andy Silvernail : Thank you, Deane. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Mishan : Thank you. Good morning, Andy and Mike. Andy Silvernail : Good morning. Mike Yates : Hi, Matt. Matthew Mishan : I wanted to drill down a little bit further into life sciences. The orders were clearly very strong there in the quarter. But the customer that warned, they didn't really see it until late in 3Q and then really took down 4Q expectations. Couldn't that result in a bit of an inventory overhang for you? And then can you also talk a little bit about what you are seeing with some of your broader life science customers later in the quarter and early in the fourth quarter? And should we feel confident that it's a genomics or a single customer -- let's call it a transitory headwind and not a little bit broader? Andy Silvernail : Yes, so again, I want to be really, really careful. We don't comment on any specific customer. So, what -- we are -- where we sit in the food chain, what we experience in our numbers tends to be -- was already played out for us by the time it has played out in the markets for our customers generally. Just because of how that works in the supply chain and timing, et cetera. And so we don't see a major change in the fourth quarter based on anything you see out there in the marketplace. And also I think it's really important to note that this is -- we're talking about no customer being more than 2% of sales. So we don't have a single customer that is material to the IDEX results as we think about that in the portfolio. So with that said, as I think about the broader life sciences market, I think there's always bumps in there. Every six or so quarters, you'll see a bump in these marketplaces based on when products are shipping, et cetera, product life cycles, supply chain. But the story is a good news story. We have seen strength in those markets; we expect to see strength in those markets going forward and for those to be above the IDEX average in terms of growth. Matthew Mishan : Okay, great. And just a bigger-picture question for me on the type of -- on the projects that are being pulled. What do you think needs to happen for those to be given the thumbs up from your customers? Andy Silvernail : I think it's a combination of sustained improvement in a commodities world -- and this sounds like such a weak answer, but confidence. There is a general lack of confidence in spending money and putting yourself out forward and putting a lot of capital forward. And so I think that confidence is a combination of two years of a pretty soft market, a very uncertain political environment that people just aren't comfortable with how things are going to want to play out. And I think that really needs to happen. A little bit of improvement in the overall economic growth rate would go a long way. Certainly people are seeing this is starting to play through in wage inflation. And see what's going to happen in the global marketplace. So you are seeing some elements of it spark there, but in general, you are not seeing that catalyst that is going to push that forward. And as we think about our 2017 planning, we don't see a catalyst. We don't see that happening. We are well-positioned to deal with it if it does. We have always said time and again that we are very able to react on the upside and we never want to get caught on the downside. And so for our ability to mobilize and execute a faster environment, we feel really comfortable around that in terms of supply chain and our ability to produce. And at the same time, we think that this environment is going to continue here into 2017. Matthew Mishan : All right. Thank you very much. Andy Silvernail : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Liptak with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question. Walter Liptak : Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Andy Silvernail : Hey, Walt. Walter Liptak : I wanted to ask about the productivity gains that you're getting and wondering what inning you are in the process that you have been doing to get margins to where they are now. Andy Silvernail : You know, Walt, I feel really comfortable that we can continue to drive productivity. I'll tell you, what has accelerated our gains this year has been around the focus we've had on about a quarter of our portfolio that are fixed businesses. We told you earlier in the year that that makes up about 25% of our business. Into this year, we are almost 300 basis points better in profitability around those businesses. And so that has just been a very, very good news story. And let's keep in mind, too, that we are delivering this kind of margin profile with some of our bellwether, most profitable companies struggling that have really been hit most by this commodity and overall industrial distribution. So if you think about Viking, Warren Rupp, Band-It, Banjo and even rescue tools -- so rescue tools has -- it's a different struggle for rescue tools because of the weakness in emerging markets around sovereign budget. But if you look at those five businesses, those are big profit contributors to this company. And they have been hit squarely with the headwind. And what we have been able to do is be able to really deliver the quality of earnings in those businesses, continued -- very, very high quality of earnings in those businesses and cash flow and at the same time still drive overall margin potential with what we're doing in the rest of the business. So, when I think about our execution and our positioning for any kind of improvement, we are in a good spot. Walter Liptak : Okay, all right. That sounds great. Is there a number that we can think of -- I know you give the leverage number. But in terms of where you think you can get operating -- adjusted operating margins if you go a couple years out, is there a number that you think the whole business can get to? Andy Silvernail : Walt, with modest growth, a couple of points. We can get 50 plus -- Mike Yates : 50 to 80 basis points of margin improvement, Walt, is what we have kind of said. Andy Silvernail : Yes, with a couple of points growth. And that breakeven point, when I say breakeven point, I mean the point at which we can still expand margins has gone down substantially and our ability to drive productivity. And so if we continue to see a soft environment, we will still get better margins going forward. Walter Liptak : Okay, that's great. All right. Thanks, guys. Andy Silvernail : Thanks Walt. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Foung with Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your question. Jim Foung : Hi. Good morning, Andy. Andy Silvernail : Hi, Jim. Jim Foung : Good quarter -- quarter earnings here. Andy Silvernail : Thank you. Jim Foung : I want to ask you -- so pro forma for the recent acquisitions, how much of your businesses are now moving to book and ship versus capital projects? Andy Silvernail : The vast majority of our businesses are -- we are looking at book and ship. I'm not sure I can give you a specific number. But big capital projects, they have never been a big piece of our business. But they can swing -- they can certainly swing in terms of volatility in any one quarter and some of that we're seeing right now. But, historically we go into a quarter with half the quarter booked. And you've got to deliver a book and ship in the quarter of about half the business. And so that is what that kind of looks like. Now for us, no material difference. The difference is I think the larger CapEx really are the things that we have had in the past and were a buffer. Those have certainly been pushed or canceled. Jim Foung : Right. So at the margin, that can be a swing for you\u2026 Andy Silvernail : It can. If you look at where we stand today and our expectations for fourth quarter organic, that is the big pivot. But at the same time, we are finding ways to cover it. We are finding ways to still grow income and do a great job around cash. Jim Foung : Right, okay. And then could you just talk about that 500 basis point improvement from the acquisition, AWG and Akron? And I guess also maybe SFC, what kind of positive surprises you might see there? Andy Silvernail : I think -- let me talk about SFC first. That's a very high-margin business and that is really around a growth story. So that's our focus with SFC. And by the way, with AWG and Akron, growth is a critical component to the overall story. But recognizing that when we bought the businesses, we saw more opportunity to get the margin profile -- margin profiles in line with our core IDEX business -- and that's about 500 basis points in total. And Akron has been part of the portfolio a little bit longer. Back earlier in the year, we bought the business. We have had great results so far with it, and AWG is a terrific fit. You put that together with our other safety and rescue assets, there's a lot of opportunity to grow the business and to improve margin profile. Jim Foung : Any kind of timetable in terms of when you might see the margin improvement coming? Andy Silvernail : I think what we have said in the past and I wouldn't change it, is there is no reason you wouldn't see a couple hundred basis points out of the gate for those businesses and then the balance over three years. So I think it takes three years to get 500 basis points, but there's no reason you wouldn't see a couple hundred basis points in that first year. Jim Foung : Great. Thank you so much. That's all I have. Andy Silvernail : Thank you, Jim. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Giannakouros with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. Jim Giannakouros : Good morning, Andy and Mike. Thanks for taking my question. Andy Silvernail : Hi, Jim. Jim Giannakouros : Your comments on 4Q restructuring, were they isolated to integrating your recent acquisitions, or are there other restructuring actions potentially in play? Just noting that historically you have taken the opportunity to do some of that activity in other segments. Andy Silvernail : Yes, Jim, so the bulk of it is from the acquisitions, but there are a few other areas that we are taking the opportunity to do some consolidation and get some leverage. And so we will see some improvement in some other businesses also. Jim Giannakouros : Okay. And then to understand the divestitures, I know that they are small, but was there a certain growth profile that just didn't make your -- you didn't see the outlook as strong as you would like or a certain margin profile that just didn't make the cut? What drove the decision to divest those -- each of those? And did you mention -- and I missed it if you did -- what that third divestitures was in early October? Andy Silvernail : Yes, let me talk about the rationale behind it. When we think about these things, it's not necessarily just a growth profile that we're looking at. It is really around how are they going to be advantaged or disadvantaged long-term with us as the owners. And so with the things that we have sold, we have sold them principally to people who have one of two things; either a different expectation of long-term performance than we have, but, more importantly, the ability to better position that business with an asset that they own. And so -- and we have elected to not make the investment to get that competitive scale. So what you are seeing us do are sell relatively small things or very small things that don't have a unique advantage today that really need some kind of relative competitive scale. And we are selling those things that we don't -- we have decided that it's not worth the organic or inorganic investment to us, that the opportunities are elsewhere and that's really how we have been making those decisions. And also keep in mind things that are small and don't have the kind of advantage that we look for in business, they take a lot of management time. They are disproportionate in what they require from a management time and we would rather put those resources elsewhere. In terms of -- have we said what our -- the businesses -- their business? Mike Yates : No. Andy Silvernail : We have not published that yet, so we won't do so. But we're talking something that is small. You'll see it as things roll out here in the next few weeks. Jim Giannakouros : Got it, okay. And one last one if I may and I apologize if I did miss it. When you talk about FMT, you talk about general industrials being the swing factor there as far as your organic prospects. But did you comment specifically on CFP? And if not, could you get a little granular there on what you're seeing in those specific end-markets? Andy Silvernail : Yes, you are really talking about Viking and Warren Rupp for the most part. When you say CFP that is the bulk of it, right, Richter whatnot. Really the same factors we're talking about generally. Those are the big pieces of us -- of our FMT business is based in the general industrial world. And they have had a tough go in 2017. They have been hit disproportionately to the pressures that we are seeing in energy and the general industrial markets. But, again, all of those businesses have seen sequential stability in their day rate business with some incremental negative on the CapEx side. Jim Giannakouros : Got it. Thank you. Andy Silvernail : Thanks Jim. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charley Brady with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question. Charley Brady : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Just want to -- a quick one on the commentary on ag saying that you saw a slight up tick, I know you are not calling the market, but I can't recall anyone else saying ag is up. So -- Andy Silvernail : That's why we want to be very careful in saying I'm not going to call this an inflection point. I think that would be a mistake. We saw some improvement in the quarter. It's been a tough story overall. But, we did see some sequential improvement in the quarter and some year-over-year improvement in the quarter. But I think -- let's be hesitant on that one. It was good to see, but we've got to have a lot more data points before I make any commentary that I think it's -- we have seen a sustainable inflection. Charley Brady : Can you expand on what you think drove some of that strength even if it was only temporary, what was behind that? Mike Yates : Charley, it was probably depleted inventories just in channel and a pent-up demand for the replacement parts. It's been down for almost seven quarters. Andy Silvernail : Yes. I think its more replacement parts than it is equipment pick-up. There's still a lot of equipment in the channel. There is a lot of equipment in the field, there's a lot of equipment in the channel, so it's really a replacement part story versus a meaningful up tick in equipment. Charley Brady : Got it. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question. Joe Giordano : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. Andy Silvernail : Hi, Joe. Joe Giordano : In terms of orders at HST and fully appreciating your comments about the materiality of any specific customers, but that segment order has been down -- flat to down four of the last five quarters. So I was a little surprised that this would be the quarter that you start seeing it perk up here. Is that more of a function of comps just getting easier, or are you seeing anything specific in that market that is kind of driving that here? Andy Silvernail : Yes, I wouldn't say there's any major change. We did note that the back-half comp started to get easier. So, hey, we are glad to see it. It's good to see, but is no major inflection different from what we've talked about so far. Joe Giordano : Okay. And just related to the commentary you've heard from the major players in that space, do you get a sense that maybe like a slowdown in financing and just deal activity in that health care space is just putting a little bit of a crimp in just spending and capital spending there? Do you think it's deal-related in a way? Andy Silvernail : I'm not sure I understand the question, Joe. You're saying because\u2026 Joe Giordano : A lot of the sequencing is still on more of the research side. And the lack of just general, like, funding in the markets is capital funding for small companies in that space. Do you think that's impacting just overall demand there a little bit, like more of a temporary thing in that sense? Because I know you have this view -- a long-term view is very positive there. Andy Silvernail : No, I don't think so. I think you've got -- when you are talking about sequencing, you have got major product cycles that are critically important. And you have got this movement from, I will call it, the lab space into more of a commercial application. And so that is a move that everyone has expected to happen. And with that, you see a movement from very, very high-priced equipment down to more readily available lower-priced equipment that is more deployable into the field. I think -- when you step back and think about the potential for this industry and you look at the number of sequences that are sold per year compared to the number of mass spec or analytical instruments in ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography, it's tiny. I mean, it is absolutely tiny. And when you look at the applications and where those can go and land, and the number of potential units that can be sold into commercial applications -- and when I say commercial, I mean non-laboratory research, the number is huge. It is multiples of what is sold today. And so it's not going to be smooth; it's not going to be perfect. But if I think five years from now or 10 years from now compared to where we are today and the unit volume that you would expect, it's going to be much, much, much higher. That is the bet we're making. Joe Giordano : Okay. That's fair. Then if I could just sneak in one last one on the divestments. You mentioned that the stuff that you have been buying, a little bit more asset-light then maybe the average. Is there any consistent -- in divestments, is this a move to further asset-light the portfolio? Are these kind of on the high-end in terms of average? Andy Silvernail : No, I wouldn't read into that at all. Across our business, we are pretty asset-light. You're talking about 1.5%, 2% CapEx intensity for the businesses. We're not necessarily buying things that are lower than that or selling things that are higher than that. It is really around market positioning. Market positioning and what I would call relative competitive scale. So, what -- if you look at what really works for us, it is when we are in a niche that is big enough to be attractive, but small enough to not get the gorillas of the world if you wanted to compete for it. And then we have the attractive relative market share position. So we are a classic number one or number two. And that -- the profit pools in that scenario and the attractiveness is very, very high. When you are a distant three, four, five and you don't have a pathway, or if the niche is too small, that's where it's just not very attractive for us. Joe Giordano : Makes sense. Thanks, guys. Andy Silvernail : Thanks Joe. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back to Mr. Silvernail for final remarks. Andy Silvernail : Well, thank you very much and thank you, everybody, for joining us on the call today. I think as I open this up, my hope is that people will really focus in on what we've done to drive operating results and what we have the ability to do given this continued weak macro environment. And, again, I think our overall execution has been extremely strong. The underlying operating earnings of this company and our potential to drive earnings growth over time, I think is substantial. We have done a nice job with disciplined capital deployment and we've got a great balance sheet to continue to do that. So, look, we're going to have to continue to work through this murky macro environment that's going to be with us for a while, but we are exceptionally well-positioned to drive total shareholder return as we go forward. So, again, thank you for your questions today and thank you for your support of IDEX. And we will talk to you here in about 90 days. Take care. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Andy Silvernail. Andrew Silvernail : Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everybody. I appreciate you all joining us for the discussion of our 2016 fourth quarter and our full-year results. Before I get going, I want to introduce Bill Grogan, our new CFO. Bill, welcome to the senior executive team and the CFO chair. Bill has been with us for more than five years and most recently was Head of our Financial Group for Operations working side-by-side with Eric Ashleman. And so he really did an outstanding job there with building the teams, driving the operating model, and has been a key part to our overall success in terms of driving results in the last-half decade. So congratulations, Bill, and welcome to the team. A - William Grogan : Thanks, Andy. Andrew Silvernail : Also, I want to thank Mike Yates. Mike has really stepped in in the late summer when we had the interim chair open up and did an outstanding job. And I think it\u2019s a real testament to Mike that we did not miss a beat through this process and really we are incredibly fortunate to have somebody of Mike\u2019s caliber on our team and continuing on our team as we go forward. So thank you, again, Mike, very much, I appreciate it. Michael Yates : Very welcoming, Andy. Andrew Silvernail : So I\u2019m going to take a second here and just summarize 2016. As everyone knows, it was a difficult year in terms of the top line with challenging global industrial environment. At the same time, we did a really nice job on the bottom line and with cash flow. And so even with these mixed economic conditions throughout 2016, there were some bright spots and they were really around our Scientific Fluidics business, municipal and commercial markets, and all of those actually performed reasonably well in the year. And then we had some major headwinds really around the global industrial markets clearly within FMT and then the industrial pieces of HST. But I will say, as we had organic quarter growth in the third quarter and again organic growth in the fourth quarter and a promising start to January, we\u2019re cautiously optimistic that we\u2019re beginning to see a recovery. With that said, I\u2019m hesitant and I\u2019m hesitant, because I\u2019m not convinced yet that we\u2019re seeing a comprehensive turn and really I\u2019m not because the global economic environment and very much the global political environment is volatile and it\u2019s uncertain. And I think it\u2019s prudent at this stage to be more conservative than aggressive. And as we built our plan for this year, we took in mind all of the volatility that\u2019s out there. And as you guys full well know, we can respond very well on the upside. We have a very flexible operating model. We have a low overall labor content in our business. We really have no capacity constraints in terms of machinery equipment or facilities. So really it\u2019s supply chain that becomes the sticking point in the upside. So we can respond very quickly. We would have outstanding flow through in case that happened, but we\u2019re going to be prudent right now. And so as we exited 2016 and I look back, I\u2019m very proud of how our team executed. We drove productivity. We improved working capital, and we continue to invest in our teams and the culture of this business. And we come into 2017 with a very strong balance sheet. We have gross leverage of 1.8 times and obviously, net leverage significantly below that. Cash flow was strong and we\u2019re in a great position to exploit this via our capital deployment strategy. That\u2019s fundamentally unchanged here for almost a half decade that we\u2019ve been using and has been driving returns for us. As I mentioned, we did see positive order trends in the third and the fourth quarter. The initial signs in January are decent. And we\u2019re hoping that the global growth challenges are leveling off. And but as I said, we\u2019re going to remain cautious with the uncertain environment. We do believe that there\u2019s a backdrop of low growth as we think about planning our 2017. And so we\u2019re going to be prudent with this uncertainty of the economic and the political environments. As we look at the year, orders grew sequentially each month in the fourth quarter and the improvements were broad-based across our portfolio, so virtually every business saw improvements as we move through the quarter. And this resulted in organic order growth of 3%. In the second-half, half we had our first two sequential positive order growth quarters since the beginning of 2014. And so again, that\u2019s encouraging. We also deployed over $0.5 last year. We acquired three businesses, as you know, and we also divested four businesses, and I\u2019ll get into more detail here in a minute. But the four businesses that we divested weren\u2019t aligned with our strategic objectives, and I\u2019ll walk you through that here in just a little bit. As you know, deep segmentation has been a critical element of our success and really the fundamental, the foundation of our operating model. And the improvements in profitability, cash flow, and return on investment these past years have really been driven by these efforts. And over the last 18 months, we\u2019ve taken this segmentation, which really had \u2013 has been focused on the product line in the customer level, and we\u2019re thinking about our entire business portfolio. And we\u2019ve categorized our businesses into growth outperform and fix. And as we sit here today about 70% of our portfolio is in the growth category, 10% is in the outperform, and 20% is in the fix. And so our strategy here with all of the businesses within these different categorizations is to provide a complete clarity of mission of goals, resource deployment across the portfolio, that\u2019s going to allow us to drive innovation, improve customer service and satisfaction, drive profitability and improve return on investment. And so as we look at 2017, and I\u2019ll walk you through this in some detail here at towards the end of my remarks. But we\u2019re going to continue to invest aggressively around a series of areas and we think that\u2019s critical to our long-term success. So in our growth businesses, we\u2019re going to put about $0.10 or $0.11 of earnings so to speak into incremental investments in those businesses. And I think that\u2019s key \u2013 it\u2019s been key to us winning these past few years and it\u2019s going to be very important to us winning going forward. And then, our fixed businesses, which again, I said is about 20% of our portfolio. In 2016, these businesses improved by about 300 basis points in profitability. And so, it\u2019s been an important part of the profit execution seen across their businesses, in particular, in FMT, which you saw really strong margin improvement. And these businesses are either going to graduate to growth, or outperform, or eventually if we don\u2019t think we can move them out of the fix category, we would consider divesting some of them. But I will say that that 20% is largely on track to graduate here, and we kind of give it a two-year timeframe. So they\u2019re going to find growth in the future and our teams are executing very well around that. So with that let me pivot here and talk about our markets and some regions. So on the market side, energy \u2013 the trajectory is modestly better than it\u2019s been obviously with the improvement in the price of oil that certainly is helpful. But there\u2019s going to be headwinds, right. The CapEx cuts that came in the midstream and downstream are going to impact us this year and that\u2019s going to hit our energy platform Band-it and ceiling to some degree. The downhole business, I think will improve and we are starting to see that on the banded side in particular. But I do think that the LPG market is going to be soft here in 017. On the industrial side and that\u2019s really been the story for a couple of years now and the industrial markets remain challenged in 2016. We did see some stabilization towards the middle part of the year and as we move forward. And we are hopeful that we\u2019re turning a corner, but obviously, we\u2019re going to wait for more evidence before we\u2019re willing to make a bet on that. Ag, depressed commodity prices, low farm incomes have been a huge headwind there. We have seen a slight improvement and we think that\u2019s going to continue into 2017. Life sciences has been a real bright spot for us. It\u2019s been an \u2013 that was an outstanding year in that market. Our core markets in bio, analytical and IVD have all performed well, and we think that\u2019s going to continue to do so here in the future. And finally, municipal. All the indicators point towards continued modest growth in 2017. So we think that will be a plus. In terms of geographies in North America, the story goes back to the industrial recession that really existed here for a couple of years. And so, obviously, we\u2019re hopeful of the signs of recovery, but again, we\u2019re going to be cautious. Europe is really a mixed bag, depends on the country and it really depends on the business. Our dispensing and our water businesses, which are two of our bigger European-facing businesses have done quite well. But the performance across Europe is pretty spotty. And so we think that will probably continue in 2017. Asia, India has been terrific for us. We have \u2013 we really won in terms of market share and the business focus there. But China has been more difficult with really the industrial recession there also as they move from an investment-driven economy to a consumer economy. We do expect some improvement in China, however, in 2017. Let me turn to a little bit conversation on capital deployment. So, we\u2019ve had this balanced discipline capital deployment strategy for sometime, and I think it works very well. Our overall goal is to drive spiritual [ph] shareholder returns and we have four pillars of this strategy. We\u2019re going to fully fund organic growth. We\u2019re going to take assistant quarterly dividends. We\u2019re going to opportunistically repurchase stock and we\u2019re going to execute strategic M&A. And so here we are with a very strong balance sheet, strong free cash flow, and this is going to give us leverage as we go forward, and we use that leverage well in 2016. So as I mentioned before, we deployed over $0.5 billion in three acquisitions; Akron, AWG and SFC, and those hit two different markets in three different countries. So really spread nicely across our portfolio and our ability to manage and integrate those businesses. The Akron and AWG really changed the face of our fire and safety business, and SFC did the same for our ceiling group. The integrations across the Board are going well and so we\u2019re very positive about these acquisitions going forward and the benefits that we expect to see in 2017 are identical to what we talked about in the third quarter, and I\u2019ll detail that here in a little bit. We did decide to divest some businesses this year four relatively small businesses. Hydra-Stop and two Optics businesses; one in Japan and one in Korea, and then our IETG business, which is in the UK. In total, those businesses had about $40 million of revenue for us in 2016, which obviously will trade-off against the benefits of the three acquisitions that we did. And again, I\u2019ll walk you through the puts and takes of that here towards the end of my remarks. As we think about organic growth, we have continued to invest in organic growth across our businesses. But as we go into 2017, there are a few businesses that are going to get even more money and we\u2019re going to get more aggressive around it. And that\u2019s really around our bio, biopharma businesses, some product launches in water, next-generation of rescue tools, and local for local products in India, and then in some degree an increased investment in China, where we\u2019ve recently opened a facility. And so we\u2019re going to put money really it\u2019s about the future. And as you know, investments for us, it takes time to germinate. The markets move slowly, but you have to be committed and you have to invest year-in and year-out, and that\u2019s what will allow us to be successful in the long-term. On the capital deployment front, in 2016, we increased our dividend by 6% and we returned 38% of net income to our shareholders. And we also bought back 739,000 shares in the year at a cost of about $55 million, which is about 1 percentage here and that happened very early on in 2016. All right. I\u2019m now on the 2016 financial results. That slide four, if you will join me there. So just a reminder, these results exclude the impact of restructuring actions, the gain and loss in divestitures in 2016 and 2015, as well as the pension settlement. But I will detail all of those for folks, so they can get their modeling correct as we go forward. All right. For the full-year, orders and sales were $2.1 billion, up 6% and 5%, respectively. Orders were flat organically and sales were down 1% organically. Organic orders and sales were really pressured by the weak economy that I\u2019ve talked about in detail already around oil and gas in North American industrial. And then our margin actually this a good story. So we finished the year, but there\u2019s a lot of moving parts, let me take a minute here. We finished the year at 20.6%, which was down by 40 basis points year-over-year. But keep in mind that had $14.8 million of fair value step up versus $3.7 million in 2015. So obviously, that\u2019s a big impact. If you neutralize for that, our margins were up about 10 basis points year-over-year. But also keep in mind, that\u2019s diluted \u2013 that has a diluted impact of acquisitions. So if you look at apples-to-apples, so if you remove the acquisitions and look at the base business versus base business, 2016 versus 2015, margins were up 80 basis points to 22.5%, so that really shows terrific execution in the base business pre-acquisitions and demonstrates that operating model continues to work. Cash flow, a great story. Cash from operations was $400 million in the year, $362 million of free cash flow, and that was up 12% over last year and 125% of net income. GAAP EPS was $3.53, adjusted EPS is $3.75, that was up $0.20, or 6% on an adjusted basis. Let me take a second and walk you through that $0.22 between the adjusted and the GAAP EPS. So we had a $0.03 charge from restructuring actions, I\u2019ll talk about the benefits here in a moment. We had a $0.16 loss on the sale of four divested businesses and we had a $0.03 charge from the pension settlement. On a final note, of the $3.53 in GAAP EPS, there\u2019s also about a $0.04 related to a favorable transaction FX in regards to intercompany loan that we acquired when we bought SFC. So that was favorable by about $0.03 in the fourth quarter and $0.01 in the first quarter. We have hedged that loan and so we won\u2019t see the volatility here in the future. and so but it will be \u2013 those $0.04 will be a headwind as we think about 2017. All right. For the fourth quarter, organic orders were $547 million, that was up 10% overall and 3% organically, and we continue to see an uptick in those orders here that we started to talk about in the third quarter. Revenue was $530 million, up 6% flat organically, and organic sales were up slightly 0.3% in the fourth quarter. And although that certainly is modest, it\u2019s the first positive organic sales growth that we\u2019ve seen since the fourth quarter of 2014. Adjusted op margin for the quarter was 20.5%, that was down 50 basis points year-over-year, but again entirely due to the fair value inventory step up. And so exclusive of this charge, we actually improved margins by 40 basis points over last year. Fourth quarter free cash flow very strong, $106 million in the quarter, that was up 20$ from last year and a 143% of net income for the fourth quarter. GAAP EPS were $0.75, adjusted was $0.96, that was a $0.02 increase over last year. We had $0.21 between the Q4 adjusted and the GAAP EPS, and those are all the items that I mentioned before except there was a $0.01 of that that fell into the third quarter, so $0.21 fell into the fourth quarter. I will also note that we did have significant translational FX as we saw the dollar strengthened significantly in the quarter and that cost us about $0.02 in the fourth quarter. All right. So let me spend a few minutes here on the noise in the fourth quarter. I know there\u2019s a lot of moving parts and I want to make sure everybody has these pieces really clearly. So as I discussed earlier, the four divestitures, we incurred about a $20 million pre-tax loss on the two businesses that we sold in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s a $14 million net loss after the $6 million tax benefit that we realized. We also incurred a $3.6 million pension settlement in the fourth quarter. This charge was related to employees taking a lump sum distribution rather than future monthly pension payments. We did talk about this in the third quarter and it was on the low-end of our expectation. We also incurred about $3.7 million of restructuring costs. We noted that we were going to have some restructuring costs we talked about in the third quarter. These are related to severance and facility closures around acquisitions and plus an announced facility consolidation with our MPT platform. We will get about $4 million of benefit in 2017. Okay, let\u2019s pivot now and let\u2019s talk about the segments. I want to start with fluid metering, I\u2019m on Slide 5. So we finished 2016, organic orders were down 2% in the fourth quarter and down 3% for the full-year. Sales were flat in the quarter and down 1% for the full-year. Op margin was a great story, up 190 basis points for the quarter, up a 100 basis points for the year, really terrific execution around productivity and even with difficult market conditions maybe except for water people really got after the cost structure and right-sized their businesses and we had just outstanding margin improvement. And so, as I mentioned before, we had great improvement in our fixed businesses and many of those sit in FMT and we\u2019re a major portion of the margin improvement in the segment. In terms of some of the areas, water services has been strong. It was strong in the fourth quarter. Again, we think it will be solid as we \u2013 if you think about 2017. Industrial, the story I told already many times softness across the North American landscape. The impact of oil and gas have certainly been substantial and weakness in the chemical market in Europe also. So, while we do see some beginning signs of recovery, we\u2019re pretty cautious here around this marketplace. Energy, it remains a tough story. Our mobile business, the downstream portions of the business that CapEx cuts just started late last year. Those are going to play negatively to those businesses, I think in 2017, so they will be behind the curve relative to what you\u2019ll see in the downhole side, which I think will pick up faster and certainly some of our peers have seen that. But we will have some headwinds here early in 2017 around those markets. And finally, Ag, as I mentioned earlier, we have seen some positive indications, so we\u2019re looking for kind of very small improvement in 2017. Okay, let\u2019s turn to health and science, I\u2019m on Slide 10. At the end of the day no real changes in our perspective in the health and science markets. Our overall life sciences and scientific businesses are doing really well, and they\u2019ve been offset by weakness in industrial very similar to everything I\u2019ve talked about with FMT. We had a very strong organic order quarter, up 7%, excuse me, on the heels of also a strong order quarter in the third quarter. So this is promising. For the year, organic orders were up 2%, but certainly we finished very strong in the order front with HST. Our sales were down 1%, both in the fourth quarter and for the year, but obviously, we come into the year with momentum. On the op margin side and again, I think, there\u2019ll be a number of questions here on this. So let me take some time on this. They were down 330 basis points in the fourth quarter and down 100 basis points for the year. Both of these decreases were really primarily impacted by the step up in SFC. If you exclude that, margins would have been down a 100 basis points for the fourth quarter and 20 basis points for the year, and really all of that is due to mix. In 2015, we had a very strong overall profitability in our material processed business and that flipped around in the fourth quarter of this year and had relatively weak margins in MPT and that really accounts for that balance. We do expect margins in HST to be in that 23% range in 2017, so we expect that to rebound nicely as we go forward. In terms of the overall segments within health and science, industrial looks a lot like FMT, as I\u2019ve already talked about, and we have seen again some early signs of improvement, but cautiousness generally. Scientific Fluidics and Optics, as I said before, really strong overall performance. The markets are growing. We\u2019re winning share on new platforms. And so, overall, we have a lot of confidence in that business going forward around life sciences. Ceiling solutions is a mixed bag. Oil and gas has been weak, while the semiconductor market has been strong, and those two have really kind of balanced each other off. And then finally, MPT, as I mentioned has been mixed. This is a pretty lumpy business. It had a strong fourth quarter order book. So we think we\u2019ll come out of gates relatively strong with MPT. But it has been a mixed bag between pharma and industrial businesses. All right. I\u2019m on the last segment, diversified on Slide 11. Boy, it\u2019s just an outstanding year for the teams here in diversified. The two major acquisitions really change the landscape for our fire and rescue business, and so now it\u2019s all about driving the execution here. We finished very strong. Organic orders were up 9% in the fourth quarter, up 2% for the year. Our sales were down 3% for the year, but following orders, we had a strong finish at sales being up 3%. Op margin was down a 150 basis points, but entirely due to the step up that we had $7.5 million. So again, we are \u2013 this business is performing well and we expect to have really solid margin profile in 2017. Our dispensing was solid across North America, Europe and Asia. The X-Smart product line continues to have momentum and generally the dispensing outperformed. In fire and rescue, a nice uptick in the fourth quarter. As you know, this has been a business has been weak here for sometime and we saw strength across the markets and we had some nice wins in Asia, which we hadn\u2019t seen in quite sometime. The team did an outstanding job with new product launches and they\u2019re doing a nice job of integrating Akron and AWG and we\u2019re on track to hit our goals with those acquisitions. Excuse me. On Band-It, the transportation business was solid. We are seeing some modest improvements on the oil and gas side that would be a good sign here for Band-It going forward. All right. Couple more slides here and really all about guidance for the year and for the fourth quarter. I\u2019m on Slide 12. So we anticipate organic growth to be about 1% to 2% for the year and this should give us somewhere between $0.15 and $0.23 of incremental earnings for 2017. However, we\u2019re going to have a pretty significant $0.12 headwind from FX. The \u2013 as you know, the dollar has strengthened significantly. We have exposure to the euro, the Swiss franc, the Canadian dollar, and the pound. And so, those are meaningful headwinds. And as I mentioned before, that\u2019s broken down into about an $0.08 headwind on translational FX and the $0.04 that\u2019s related to the intercompany loan that I mentioned earlier that we\u2019ve hedged here going forward. But in total, as you guide into the back-half of the year and really sort of the back month or so of the year as the dollar strengthened, we lost a lot of ground, a $0.02 in the fourth quarter, and now in total, $0.12 of headwind for the year. As we look at acquisitions, last quarter we told you that that net of divestitures we thought that acquisitions would add about $0.25 to earnings incrementally. That number is now $0.24, but entirely due to the fact that we sold two other businesses in the fourth quarter. And so we\u2019re right on our expectations of what those businesses should add to our portfolio. Share count will creep a little bit and it\u2019s going to be a $0.03 headwind for us. The restructuring actions that I mentioned before are going to be a $0.03 tailwind, and they\u2019re really related to rooftop and severance consolidation \u2013 severance items. We did have a couple of one-time corporate items in 2016 that are not going to repeat in 2017. About $0.04 is from the earn-out reversal that we talked about in the first quarter of last year. So if you remember, in our first quarter earnings report of 2016, we had a really strong overall quarter and because we had about $0.04 benefit from that earn-out reversal that obviously we won\u2019t get again in 2017. And we did have a $0.02 of benefit coming from compensation-related items as the CFO change happened and some compensation was forfeited. We\u2019re get about $0.02 of benefit from productivity net of inflation, so our teams have done a really nice job of offsetting wage inflation and very modest material inflation, but we will get $0.02 of net benefit. And then, as I mentioned before, we\u2019re going to keep investing even with this backdrop of continued low growth. We think we need to continue to put money into our best bets and that\u2019s going to be kind of $0.10 or $0.11 in 2017 of incremental spend. All right. I\u2019m on our last page here on Slide 13, and a couple more items here on Q1 2017 and full-year 2017 guidance. So in the first quarter, we think EPS is going to be $0.91 to $0.93, organic growth kind of 1% to 2%, and operating margins ranging from 20.5% to 21%. The tax rate should be around 27%, and we are going to see kind of a 2% FX headwind here on the top line, and this is all based on the December 31, rate. So everything that I talked about relative to FX was based on the rates at the end of the year, which is our traditional practice. Corporate costs in the first quarter will be about $17 million. And if you look at the 2017 just a few more items. So full-year EPS should be $3.87 to $3.95, revenue growth 1% to 2%, and full-year operating margins at 21.5%. Again, we\u2019re going to have about a 2% FX headwind based on the December 31 rates. And we think corporate cost will be around $66 million for the year, and finally, the tax rate should be around 27.5% based on the current U.S. tax rates in the global tax rates. Always, as we think about these things, we exclude the impact of acquisitions, costs, or benefits associated with them or any further restructuring that they might have. So with that, let me pause here, and Doug, let\u2019s turn and open this up for questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mike Halloran from Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Mike Halloran : Hey, good morning, guys. Andrew Silvernail : Hey, Mike, good morning. Mike Halloran : And congrats on the new role I would say welcome aboard, but you\u2019ve been here for a while. So let\u2019s start on that bridge, obviously, super helpful providing the puts and takes, because there\u2019s a lot of them\u2026 Andrew Silvernail : Yes. Mike Halloran : Maybe you could frame the growth investment side. You said you\u2019re basically putting the foot down and really reinvesting this year. Twofold question there, one, frame that level of growth investment that you\u2019ve got in the 2017 bridge to what a typical year would look like? And then two, what the main focus areas look like? Is this to deal with a lot of the acquisition pieces? Is it relative to that 80% of the company that\u2019s really kind of in that growth mode, where the piece is going? Andrew Silvernail : So, Mike, this is \u2013 if you go back and you are to look in time, this is not a typical, right. So this is kind of how we thought about things over time. I think why it stands out a little bit now right is the backdrop of slower overall organic growth. And so, I guess, very importantly, we made a conscious decision that we were not going to trim back on those, given the backdrop. And for us, as you know, it takes an awful long time for these investments to germinate. And if we were to go and cut $10 million, $12 million of that cost, which you could easily do by the way, right. These are pretty variable cost you can take these out. We could have easily put up cover the FX headwind that developed here in the latter part of the year. And we just decided that was not the prudent thing to do and we should continue to invest. So very typical for us. I think the difference is Mike, is the \u2013 these are investments that are really, really targeted around a few mostly product-related areas. So in the bio, biopharma area that that whole life sciences world has taken off for us obviously and we\u2019ve got some very interesting new products that are going to take few years to germinate. But we\u2019re going to have to put several million dollars a year into those, while those takeoff. And so that fits right into the life sciences, fluidics and optics world, that\u2019s a good piece of the investment. We\u2019ve got a series of new product launches in our water world. And so if you look at our water business that\u2019s led by [indiscernible] they\u2019ve done a great job. They have been part of \u2013 a lot of those business have been in the fixed category and they have done an amazing job of changing that profile and have a whole series of new products that are going to come to market here over the next two years, now that\u2019s a major investment. In India, we are, as you know, we built two facilities in the last five, six years here in India with expansion and we\u2019re moving more and more for local needs. So a lot more product development is happening for the local markets. X-Smart has been a home run there. And what we really learned from our success and we were doing more like that. And then if you look at new product developments the next generation on rescue tools, as you know, hydraulic has been a big win for us. So we\u2019re going to continue to invest there. The StrongArm product line we\u2019ve mentioned before, that\u2019s going to continue to get investment. And then finally, around the AWG Akron acquisitions and the combination with our other fire assets, there are some really important product development opportunities around electronics, which is bringing together kind of all of the superior product capability that we have on a fire truck that links it together and creates a closed system that is going to get investment for us. So those are the major areas and they\u2019re all about growth. And so it\u2019s going to take time to germinate, but I think it\u2019s the right thing to do. Mike Halloran : And then seeing on the growth side then as we look through the year, obviously highlighted caution going into the year, which I think is prudent. Maybe one, give a sense for what you\u2019re seeing on the industrial side of your pieces once a little more short cycle maybe have some movement that could help the industrial side of Band-it, Viking Warren Rupp. Andrew Silvernail : Yes. Mike Halloran : Trends in the last couple of quarters have they been stable, slightly better, you\u2019re seeing some choppiness and what that lead into for the year? Andrew Silvernail : So, Mike, if you remember kind of back in the summer, I mentioned, we\u2019re seeing some stability, right, things had really been at a decelerating pace in the industrial or an accelerating decline in the industrial landscape up until kind of after the first quarter of 2016 and I mentioned some stability. What we saw in the third quarter was a kind of the back-end of the quarter got meaningfully better, but still spotty. It was still pretty spotty. What we saw in the fourth quarter was much more broad-based across recruitment across their businesses. And then I\u2019d say January has continued that trend. And let me be really candid. We have a lot of internal debate about the top line to market what number we\u2019re picking around the market. Mike Halloran : Yes. Andrew Silvernail : And everything that we\u2019re talking about here is based on market estimates because of what we think has really not been taken into account around the economic and the political volatility. And so our \u2013 we believe that we\u2019ll beat the markets by a point or two. And so again, it really kind of depends from what you think \u2013 what you\u2019re picking the markets to be and we\u2019ve got impressed on some of this commentary. And my point of view Mike is that, people have gotten a little over their skis on the positive sides of some of things that have been talked about and even experienced and not enough attention has really been put into the potential downsides. And so for us, we\u2019re really weighing this both sides of this equation, which has led us to be more conservative. I\u2019ll give you that, there\u2019s no doubt about it. And a lot of it comes down to, we know how our operating model flexes. And if things are better, we\u2019ll flex very quickly up and the incremental margins will be attractive. And if things are worse than some people are talking about right now, we\u2019re already positioned to deal with it. Mike Halloran : And then last and an easy one. If you just look at the guidance, is the underlying thought process here stability from current levels normal sequences as you look to the year, or are you embedding any improvement, it doesn\u2019t sound like you are, but I just want to clarify? Andrew Silvernail : Yes, so we\u2019re talking first quarter being up one to two no real big hockey stick built in. So we don\u2019t have, I think the first quarter is going to be telling for us to be candid with you, right. And so that\u2019s going to be an important barometer for how we think the rest of the year is going to play out, and January is decent. Mike Halloran : Okay. Thanks. I appreciate your time. Andrew Silvernail : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker from Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Steven Winoker : Hi, good morning, all. Andrew Silvernail : Hi, Steven, how are you? Steven Winoker : Good. Hey I\u2019d love to just start at a little higher level on capital deployment, Andy. Andrew Silvernail : Yes. Steven Winoker : So if you think about the pace that you are running at a $0.5 billion this past year based on what you are looking at in the pipeline, obviously you have the capacity. I mean, are your expectations for something as good this year? Andrew Silvernail : See, I think that would be a real challenge to be honest with you. When we at this time last year, we were really bullish on the overall ability to deploy. But we had line of sight at that point with a lot of confidence around a couple of things, while we have a very typical funnel right now. And so if we deployed $0.25 billion, that would be terrific. We don\u2019t have things kind of sitting right in front of us like we did this time last year. And so this feels more like a normal pipeline. That being said, it\u2019s a good pipeline. It\u2019s across the portfolio, and we have, obviously, we have the buyer power to do it, it\u2019s just going to be actionability, Steve. Steven Winoker : Okay. All right. And then on that 2017 guidance bridge, I would have thought maybe more than $0.02 on productivity net of inflation. Can you just talk through maybe the pieces there, what are you baking in? And why is it and a more? Andrew Silvernail : Yes, so you\u2019ve got about \u2013 what you have is, you\u2019ve got about $20 million of headwind plus or minus and that\u2019s mostly driven by wage inflation, which \u2013 it is not a lot of material inflation. Obviously, you\u2019ve got some metals here and there that have which seems a little bit on. We\u2019re in a really good position and obviously, we\u2019re really cognizant of potential inflation spikes something that we\u2019re paying a lot of attention to. But the material side should be modest. The wage side is very typical. So call it $20 million. So we\u2019ll get kind of $22 million of total productivity, and so that will net us or sorry a little bit more in that $23 million, $24 million, and that will net us kind of a $0.02 in total. Steven Winoker : Okay. All right, that sound. I guess\u2026 Andrew Silvernail : Again by the way right, that\u2019s \u2013 that does not include restructuring, right. So you\u2019ve got another $0.03, $0.04 on the restructuring side. So I would call all of that productivity, but we just happened to break it out specifically, because we called out restructuring charges. Steven Winoker : Right. No, and then normally that\u2019s how we\u2019d see it, so that\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thanks, guys. Andrew Silvernail : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Nathan Jones : Good morning, everyone. Andrew Silvernail : Hi, Nathan. Nathan Jones : Andy, I\u2019d like to go back to the growth investments for a minute, and you\u2019ve never been shy about funding growth investments in the company really regardless of the environment, $0.11 is a pretty big step up. Is this something that we should anticipate continuing at that level for the next few years? Will it step up again in 2018, step down in 2018? Andrew Silvernail : I think, it\u2019s what you would expect, right. And so the way I kind of think about the math that the math doesn\u2019t change here, right. So the incremental benefits that we\u2019ve always talked about that 30% to 35% even including these investments is there, right. So when you kind of work through all the puts and takes of all this and you look at it, you go okay, that \u2013 those incrementals are there, especially when you kind of step back and you think about the one-time thing that we benefited from in 2016. So we\u2019re not going to compress our incrementals by these kind of investments, Nathan. And but I think the variable here is obviously in a higher growth environment, you\u2019re going to get much better incrementals, in a lower growth environment you get more towards kind of the downside of where guided historically. Nathan Jones : Understood. I was more talking about the level of investment that you\u2019re putting in to the growth investments? Andrew Silvernail : ICS being really aggressive, Nathan. I think is, I think everybody \u2013 everyone we talk to and we spend time with, the differentiators is going to be organic growth, right. And even when you think about acquisitions, right, when you acquire the way you really drive overall returns, obviously we\u2019re very good at the cost out. But you\u2019ve got to deliver on the top line too, which means you\u2019ve got to deliver overall on the organic side. So these kind of investments I think are prudent and we\u2019re going to do it in good times and in difficult times. Nathan Jones : Understood. And you\u2019ve been pretty clear about that over many years. Andrew Silvernail : Yes. Nathan Jones : I\u2019m just wondering whether or not we should expect those growth investments to remain at the same level going forward or weather you will get more aggressive in 2018 and step up again, or just how you\u2019re thinking about that over just longer than 2017? Andrew Silvernail : Well, I\u2019m sorry, Nathan. Yes, so I would say that proportional to the size of our business, this feels about, right. Right, so as the business gets bigger, the dollars will get bigger, but I don\u2019t think and proportionally it\u2019s going to change dramatically from what we\u2019re talking about here. Nathan Jones : Okay. And then there\u2019s a $0.03 headwind from higher share count. I think IDEX typically looks to offset dilution, is that not the case this year? Andrew Silvernail : No, our practice has been to \u2013 we have a really disciplined process that we go through. And so we just said, hey, these levels will probably see some creep, but that could push one way or the other to be honest with you. We\u2019re just kind of basing on the activity that we\u2019ve had here in the last six months. But that that\u2019s one variable that could move throughout the year. Nathan Jones : Fair enough. And then just one on North American industrial, do you have any visibility into the parts of North American industrial, where you\u2019re seeing improvement or is this going through distribution and you lose visibility into it? Andrew Silvernail : Well, so I think the way I\u2019d say it, so you do lose some visibility going to distribution. But what I\u2019d say is, what we saw in the fourth quarter and what were seen early in January, and I want to be \u2013 the reason I\u2019m being so cautious here around this is \u2013 a few months does not make a trend, right. And so, but I will say that what we saw through the fourth quarter early in January it is pretty broad-based. And so whether you\u2019re talking about kind of classic distribution at Viking, or say gas as an example of Warren Rupp, or you\u2019re talking about more value-added distribution, or you\u2019re talking about even on the OE side, it\u2019s been pretty broad-based. Nathan Jones : All right. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks very much. Andrew Silvernail : Thanks, Nathan. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Mishan : Thank you and good morning. Andrew Silvernail : Good morning. Matthew Mishan : Hey, I just want to go back to the 2017 guidance bridge and maybe I missed it. But it seems like the incrementals from the $20 million to $40 million of organic growth going down to $0.15 and $0.23 of EPS seems very high. Can you talk about the incrementals you\u2019ve assumed on that? Andrew Silvernail : Yes. So you\u2019ve got to remember that includes price, right. So that that\u2019s not just volume, and so the price side of it flows through at a 100%. And so when you\u2019re looking at numbers that are that \u2013 that are 1% to 2% kind of that granular that the call it 7 to eight-tenths of a point that will get price in 2017 that that\u2019s going to flow through very high. Matthew Mishan : All right, got it. So assuming that, let\u2019s call it 80 basis points in price. What should we be thinking about if you were able to do as far as incremental go, if you were able to go from 1% or 2% growth to 3% or 4% like what would an additional incremental 100 basis points of growth give you? Andrew Silvernail : Yes, a really kind of simple rule of thumb for us is a point of organic growth, it\u2019s going to give us about $0.08 on earnings. Matthew Mishan : All right. And then on the health and science technology side, I\u2019m just curious what you\u2019re hearing from customers around the expectations for pharma and biotech in 2017. And if you saw any change in scientific fluidics in the fourth quarter? Andrew Silvernail : So, Matthew, if you recall even kind of two years ago at this time, we were talking about a product cycle \u2013 lifecycle \u2013 product cycle in the industry that was going to get a lot better starting in 2017. We said we had a lot of visibility to that and that\u2019s playing itself out now, right. So the product launches that we\u2019re seeing across the industry are pretty good and you could pick your submarket, right, they\u2019re generally \u2013 it\u2019s pretty healthy, and we\u2019re well-positioned in terms of content by platform. So we think that that 2017 and 2018 are going to be pretty good years here. If you look at the analytical instrument, IBD bio genomics, you pick your market, it\u2019s going to be pretty good. Obviously, we don\u2019t know how policy might impact that that\u2019s one wildcard that we really \u2013 everyone needs to pay attention to and just with the uncertainty that we\u2019ve seen early days we all know. But generally, in current conditions, we think both the industry is going to be pretty good and we\u2019re well-positioned. Matthew Mishan : Thank you very much. Andrew Silvernail : You bet, Matthew. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Krill : Thank you. Good morning. This is Andrew Krill on for Deane. Andrew Silvernail : Hi, Andrew. Andrew Krill : Hi, good morning. Thank you. So I want to ask, there\u2019s been a lot of speculation on tax reform in the U.S., can you comment on how IDEX might fair, given these various proposals, including the border adjustability please? Andrew Silvernail : It\u2019s really tough to put your finger on it. So let me kind of walk you a couple of things and Bill if you want to add some color to this. So obviously, if you just assumed that you had a 10 point U.S. tax cut, right a way to think of that is you can put some math on that again. We said 10 points. 10 \u2013 we have about $100 million pre-tax in the U.S. So you\u2019re talking $0.09, $0.10 of earnings impact if you went down to a 25% statutory tax rate in the U.S., right. So that\u2019s one way to put your finger on it. In terms of the cross-border issues, Bill, any commentary on that? William Grogan : Yes. I don\u2019t think we have any material risk if there were significant tariffs and replace of NAFTA. So I think for the most part, our production and supply chain is local for local, So not a lot of exposure there. Andrew Silvernail : Yes, and probably not a ton of negative. I mean, obviously, the thing that I\u2019m most worried about, Andrew, is trade war. I think everybody in my seat is nervous about that same possible reality. And one of the reasons why, frankly, we\u2019ve hedged our bets here going into 2017. Andrew Krill : Got it. Thank you. That will make sense. And there\u2019s a quick follow-up like in terms of a customer weighing with if there\u2019s any favorable repatriation holiday, can you remind us like how much of your cash is overseas and I guess maybe what this could be used for? William Grogan : Yes, I mean, there\u2019s about $200 million kind of overseas, primarily within Europe. So if there was a repatriation, we\u2019d have to look at that and t see we\u2019ve done several deals in Europe so to pay a 10%, the repatriation tax might not be worth it if we have line of sight some uses for that cash within Europe or abroad. Andrew Krill : Great. Thank you. Andrew Silvernail : Thank you, Andrew. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville from Alembic Global. Please proceed with your questions. Nicholas Chen : Hi, this is Nick Chen from Matt Summerville this morning. Thanks for taking our question. You guys touched on it a little bit before, but I just wanted to dig a little deeper into M&A. I was hoping you could talk about sort of some of the multiples you\u2019re seeing following the recent melt up in the market? And additionally, what verticals are seeing the most activity from your view? Andrew Silvernail : Yes. So, generally, Nick, the world has not changed that much that we look at right. So, excuse me. The biggest changes have really been around the public markets. And obviously, we don\u2019t play a time in that world we have. We bought some businesses from public companies in the past and whatnot. But \u2013 so that level of volatility so far we haven\u2019t seen it play itself through the broader M&A funnel that we look at. That being said, we\u2019re in the same position we\u2019ve been for an awful long time, which is things are expensive. There\u2019s no doubt about it. You\u2019ve got to be incredibly disciplined, and you\u2019ve got to be disciplined around price, but you also have to be really disciplined around what fits in your operating model. And so, we\u2019re \u2013 there\u2019s very few things that can make a deal go sour faster than overpaying and we\u2019re just not going to do that. And so, we like our funnel, but we\u2019re going to be very disciplined about prices in the marketplace, and that fundamentally hasn\u2019t changed here in the last few months. Nicholas Chen : Great. And then just finally, I was hoping you could talk about in terms of an improvement in energy in the industrial \u2013 general industrial markets? What\u2019s your guys view there? Andrew Silvernail : So I\u2019m going to call it cautious optimism, right. So, as I said before, we have seen some sequential improvement and it\u2019s relatively broad-based. The downhole-related things, which we don\u2019t have a lot of exposure to, right, it\u2019s kind of 2%, 3% of our total business. That has been, obviously, the much more volatile piece and where people are calling more potential upside, it\u2019s a really small piece for us. So I don\u2019t get too excited about that on one side or the other. The things that are further downstream from there, those CapEx cuts came a lot later in the cycle and they\u2019re still playing themselves out now. So I think we\u2019ll actually be behind that curve to some degree as that plays itself through and then we\u2019ll see if capital investment makes its way downstream, again. So I\u2019m cautious generally with industrial and oil and gas. I\u2019m more favorable in general industrial, I think, the oil and gas stuff will take more time to play itself through. Nicholas Chen : That\u2019s great. Thanks so much, guys. I\u2019ll jump back into the queue. Andrew Silvernail : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. Scott Graham : Hey, good morning, Andy, Mike, and welcome, Bill. William Grogan : Thank you, Scott. Scott Graham : Did you say, Eric was there as well? Andrew Silvernail : No he is not. Scott Graham : Oh, okay, all right. A lot of questions have been answered, but I do have a couple others. The acquisition divestiture, this is just a simple one. Is that sort of like a 75, 35, 80, 40 territory on the acquisition adds versus divestiture subtracts on revenue? William Grogan : Scott, I\u2019m not exactly sure what you mean? Scott Graham : The $40 million of incremental sales from acquisitions? William Grogan : Yes. Scott Graham : Yes. William Grogan : So the $40 million is the amount of revenue that we had in IDEX in 2016 from the businesses that we sold. So we had $40 million of revenue in those businesses. If you look at it kind of on an apples that if you look at it kind of on a trade-off basis incremental revenue of what we\u2019re going to lose from divestitures versus the incremental that we\u2019re going to get from the acquisitions because of where they landed in the year, you get somewhere around $40 million, $45 million of incremental good guy in revenue in 2017. Does that makes sense and that\u2019s all\u2026 Scott Graham : Yes, I was just looking for the two numbers that net? Andrew Silvernail : Yes. So you\u2019re talking about $40 million of divestiture that we won\u2019t get next year, right? Scott Graham : Okay. Andrew Silvernail : Against about $80 million, $85 million of revenue that will get incrementally this year netting out to call it plus $40 million to $45 million. Scott Graham : Yep, that\u2019s exactly what I was looking for. Andrew Silvernail : Yep. Scott Graham : So let\u2019s say things don\u2019t get better from here and your conservatism is valid on your organic side, Andy? Where you have flexibility down the bridge here, obviously, I\u2019m talking more specifically about, the restructuring savings, the corporate expenses, productivity, where can you flex up a little bit to make sure that you make the guidance maybe even at the high-end? Andrew Silvernail : Yes. It\u2019s a \u2013 I\u2019m not really worried about our ability to execute here, right. So, we\u2019ve proven our ability to manage these items operationally manage the investments. If the business were to slowdown, could we accelerate some restructuring? Yes, we could. Could we slowdown some timing of investments? Certainly, we could, and I think we\u2019ve demonstrated a pretty good ability to do that over time. Scott Graham : Fair enough. Last question on the M&A pipe. So, obviously, you had a big year in 2016, based on kind of where you sit today with things at various levels and in the funnel. Can you get halfway there? I mean kind of where is your head? Andrew Silvernail : At this stage, it\u2019s tough to say, because as I mentioned, I think it was Steve who asked the earlier question around this. We\u2019ve got a decent funnel. We don\u2019t have anything kind of imminent. And so, we could end up having a really big year or soft year. My hope would be that we get somewhere between. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s not something that I can peg at this point. Scott Graham : It\u2019s fine. Thanks. Andrew Silvernail : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Patrick [indiscernible] from SunTrust. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, I\u2019m standing in for Charlie Brady this morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Andrew Silvernail : You bet. Unidentified Analyst : Just one more, I guess for you guys on the growth investments, I know you guys have been talking about it quite a bit on the call. How should we think about sort of the margin impacts on each segment from these investments? And sort of I\u2019m looking at FMT right, the adjusted margin at 27.2%. Andrew Silvernail : Yes. Unidentified Analyst : It\u2019s a pretty peaked out, how should we think about that moving forward? Is there potential to move up? Andrew Silvernail : Yes, I don\u2019t \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t think about the growth investments kind of how they would impact, that is not going to be material so to speak. If you look at the overall margin performance that we expected in 2017 by segment, I think FMT for the year, it should be in the 25% range, maybe a little bit higher 26%. HST in that 22% to 23% range, and FSD in that kind of 25% range. At the segment operating level, that\u2019s what you should expect next year. So the investment should materially impact that. Again, as I answered before, even with the investments, we\u2019re still very much in line with our expectations for incremental operating margins. Unidentified Analyst : Gotcha. Thank you. And then just last one for me. What are you guys seeing sort of the \u2013 for the exit order rates in January? I mean, obviously, 2% growth in organic orders in 4Q is obviously welcoming sign. But and how do you guys sort of see January shaping up, and is that progressing more in February? Andrew Silvernail : Yes So far the January things have been decent. I think the trend that we saw at the back-half of the fourth quarter have continued. I \u2013 at this stage, again, I\u2019m hesitant to get more aggressive, because it\u2019s such a short period of time. And hey, the level of uncertainty that\u2019s out there economically and politically, it\u2019s prudent to be cautious. Unidentified Analyst : Right, thanks. That\u2019s all I have. Andrew Silvernail : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey from Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Brett Linzey : Hi, good morning, all. Andrew Silvernail : Good morning, Brett. Brett Linzey : Hey, just I wanted to come back to HST orders up 7%, you mentioned a large pharma order there. What was the contribution in the quarter. And then I guess, were you able to put a finer point on if you sort of unbundle that and look at the industrial related businesses within HST? Andrew Silvernail : Yes. Brett Linzey : What are the underlying order rates looking like there? Andrew Silvernail : Yes, so the strength that you mentioned that was within MPT, right, so we had some strength there in the MPT business. But even minus that orders were solid. We\u2019re good \u2013 very good in the life-sciences side and industrial similar to what we talked about in FMT. So some, I\u2019ll call it a few light spots, but not ready to call it, Semicon was strong. The general industrial gas micro pump still saw meaning kind of flattish, but certainly better than the trends that we\u2019re in the first-half or even in little bit later than that in 2016. Brett Linzey : Okay. And then fire and safety, I mean, orders are big there at 9% obviously pretty easy comp\u2026 Andrew Silvernail : Yes. Brett Linzey : You mentioned a lot of the close system opportunities and new product opportunities. But just in terms of the channel side, did you see any pull-through activity from AWG and Akron and then as we look forward here and you\u2019ve owned these now for about six months or how you feel about the cost side? Andrew Silvernail : So it\u2019s still very early days for any kind of what I would tell revenue synergies right, that\u2019s \u2013 those are things that take a meaningful time in those businesses, because you don\u2019t want to break it already very good channels. And so nothing meaningful there, nothing different than our expectations, but it\u2019s not like that\u2019s accelerating yet. On the cost side very much in line with our expectations, right. The restructuring charges that we took were related to that and both Akron and AWG are on track for what we committed. We talked about getting 500 basis point of improvement in those businesses over three years and I think we\u2019ll get there. Brett Linzey : Okay. And just one last one, you talked about the \u2013 having a difficulty obviously forecasting 2017 growth. You did mention, you\u2019d would like to outgrow those markets by 1 to 2 points\u2026 Andrew Silvernail : Yes. Brett Linzey : Are you assuming that for this year and implicitly does that mean you\u2019re basically kind of saying, the market is flattish in your view for 2017, and you get a little bit of outgrowth above that\u2026 Andrew Silvernail : Yes. Brett Linzey : Could you kind of square that for me? Andrew Silvernail : Yes, I mean that\u2019s the math, right, it\u2019s kind of flattish to modestly up, given the environment. Back at the Baird Conference, of course, I think I \u2013 my \u2013 I gave my talk on the on the day of the election. I said I thought that world was going to be kind of negative 1 to plus 1. And I\u2019m still kind of there maybe with even more volatility, given what\u2019s going on. So maybe I\u2019ll revert back to negative 2 to plus 2. But yes, my overall view has changed a lot obviously. The strengthening of the dollar plays into this and then obviously hit us as we think about 2017. And then there\u2019s just a lot of uncertainty right that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s really hard to peg. Brett Linzey : Yes. Okay, great. Thanks Andy. Andrew Silvernail : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano from Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question. Joseph Giordano : Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. Andrew Silvernail : You bet. Joseph Giordano : I just wanted to talk FMT orders a little bit here. I\u2019d strip out forget about like the year-on-year just looking sequentially pretty flat. I\u2019m trying to reconcile that with what some others have said on the short cycle a bit of a budget flush happened in 4Q. So would you have expected like how do that \u2013 how did the orders come in for that segment versus how you might have thought.? And then I appreciate your conservatism for 2007, as it\u2019s appropriate, but\u2026 Andrew Silvernail : Yes. So the energy business sequentially was down and that was really kind of tied to the LPG business. And so other than that, sequentially look pretty similar, not a lot of changes from what we saw in the third quarter. Joseph Giordano : Okay. And then on undiversified when you look at your dispensing business, obviously, you guys are outpunching that market\u2026 Andrew Silvernail : Yes. Joseph Giordano : But what are you thinking \u2013 but inherent in your guidance, what are you thinking for those markets that they \u2013 that those products play in like maybe slowing down\u2026 Andrew Silvernail : Yes, I think\u2026 Joseph Giordano : Maybe at your level when you think\u2026 Andrew Silvernail : Yes, I think you\u2019re right, Joe. I think those markets are going to slow here as we look at the underlying performance. I think the business will do well. We\u2019ve got a significant product launch that happens here a little bit later in the year that I think, it probably won\u2019t make a big impact in 2017, but I think will be a nice going forward. But I think those underlying markets are \u2013 the growth is going to moderate to kind of flattish to 2017. Joseph Giordano : And that\u2019s in your guided note? Andrew Silvernail : It is. Yes. Joseph Giordano : Okay. And maybe just last thinking on the diversified that order growth there made the comp is a little easy, but.. Andrew Silvernail : Yes. Joseph Giordano : How would you look at that regionally? Andrew Silvernail : Well, regionally, we are having some\u2026 William Grogan : Yes, I\u2019d say, we had throughout the year some softness in sort of our emerging markets and we saw a pick up in the fourth quarter. Andrew Silvernail : Yes. William Grogan : So some projects that have been kind of out a bit for a while finally went to official tender and\u2026 Andrew Silvernail : Mostly on rescue. Yes, that was kind of like\u2026 Joseph Giordano : Are you seeing like, how was China rescue like municipal spend over there, how is that kind of looking right now? Andrew Silvernail : Actually that was one of the big ones you\u2019ve got better, right. So, with the anticorruption probes, things really came to a screeching halt, right. And we finally saw some \u2013 that liberated a little bit here, and we actually had a very nice win in the rescue tool market in the fourth quarter with our Dinglee brand. Joseph Giordano : Great. Thanks, guys. Andrew Silvernail : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Dankert from Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question. Chris Dankert : Good morning, guys. Thanks for putting me in here. Andrew Silvernail : You bet. Chris Dankert : Just one quick question. I guess talking to some of the market players on the municipal water side, that\u2019s been an area, it\u2019s been identified by the incoming administration as kind of a spot for investment. Andrew Silvernail : Yes. Chris Dankert : There is some concern that we\u2019re going to see a bit of a pause on the state and local side hoping to get some clarity on when do the money flow through, how do we get, it cetera, is that conservative baked in, excuse me, conservatism baked into your guidance right now or have you heard anything on that front? Andrew Silvernail : We haven\u2019t heard it kind of specifically that people are having a big pause. Obviously, anything where things are \u2013 where moneys are coming from a government, we [indiscernible] conservatism around there, right. So, that obviously fits there certainly around the U.S. because there is so much uncertainty. It could be a bunch of money that flows there and frankly it could get caught. There is no clarity. And so we are \u2013 that is a piece of our hesitance. Chris Dankert : Got it, got it. And then just finally I guess, any kind of update on the footprint consolidation within diversified, how much is left to go there, any kind of timetables? Andrew Silvernail : We are kind of \u2013 stuff we\u2019ve announced, it\u2019s going well. For the most part, we should have everything done here by the end of the first quarter across the company. And so, we\u2019ve got some stuff in NPT as I mentioned before and then the specific work around the acquisitions, most of that\u2019s actually been done that we finished up in this year, so it\u2019s not a lot more to go. Chris Dankert : Got it. Great, thanks so much guys. Andrew Silvernail : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bhupender Bohra from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Bhupender Bohra : Hi, good morning, guys. Andrew Silvernail : Good morning. Bhupender Bohra : So, just wanted to, Andy, on your commentary on the press release here that you are seeing some encouraging indicators within North America, could you talk about that from the perspective of your customers capital spending versus maintenance spending plans, like, how do you think 2017 \u2013 any indications on the \u2013 I mean you talked about CapEx to be weak, but on the maintenance side, do you think that kind of picks up? Andrew Silvernail : I don\u2019t think that maintenance spend really took a big hit, right. In the world that we play in, those aren\u2019t really optional. It really is kind of the CapEx related stuff that has been \u2013 the bulk of what drove the industrial recession. And so I think that what we are seeing earlier here in this year and late last year are very modest improvements around CapEx. And so if \u2013 what\u2019s going to drive an acceleration is going to increases in CapEx. Bhupender Bohra : Okay. And the other question is on China here, I think somebody did ask, but I just wanted to \u2013 could you remind us how big China is and what are you hearing from that industrial land in China, especially with the \u2013 when you look at the ISM numbers, which have been inching like above 50 for the last few months now? Thanks. Andrew Silvernail : Yeah, so, it\u2019s \u2013 call it in the range of 5% of total business, right, so about half of that or so is done in China, for China, and another half comes from other places around the world, other businesses around the world. I would say there are certainly some modest improvements that you are seeing in China, that\u2019s really been a real struggle for everybody here with this transition from investment to consumer. And so it is, I\u2019m going to call it, modestly positive, but it\u2019s not like it\u2019s going to pick to where it was pre-2014. Bhupender Bohra : Okay, got it. Thank you. Andrew Silvernail : You bet. Operator : There are no further questions in queue. I would like to hand the call back over to management for closing comments. Andrew Silvernail : Well, thank you all very much for joining the call here today. And I know we had a lot of moving parts to talk about and I appreciate your patients and your good questions. Obviously as we think about 2017, we think about this much like the Apple the last couple of years, which is we need to make our own good fortune and I think we have positioned ourselves very well on the cost side, productivity, how we manage the balance sheet, how we deploy capital, and very importantly the growth investments that we are making for the future. And I think we are very, very well positioned regardless of what those markets do. And so, while we\u2019ve taken probably a more conservative view of the markets, we are in a great position to take advantage of that and to drive overall profitability and returns on investment and ideally that\u2019s going to translate into total reassurance for our shareholders. So, I want to thank our teams here at IDEX for continuing to execute extremely well and thank you all for your time and your interest in IDEX. And I look forward to talking to you here in 90 days. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Andy Silvernail. Andrew Silvernail : Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everybody. I appreciate you joining us here for our first quarter conference call. Obviously, I am pleased with the results here for the quarter. It\u2019s the first time and literally two years that we have had this kind of strong organic revenue growth, and we did see improvement overall throughout our businesses and the team is executing extremely well. As you know, we have been talking here for some time about the difficult market conditions, specifically in our industrial and in our energy markets. And I have been very pleased how our teams have tackled this over the last couple of years in this industrial recession. They have faced these pressures, they have delivered good results in the face of the challenges, and we are starting to see some recovery. In the first quarter, we saw evidence of this, really started in the third quarter of last year, we started to see a little bit of rebound in the late part of the third quarter, particularly in the North American industrial markets. And the improvements that we saw here in the first quarter was broad-based across most of our markets. This, on the industrial side, has been coupled with the continued strength in our life sciences, in our scientific businesses, and with this -- kind of all this coming together, we have a more favorable outlook for the balance of the year. Obviously, I am going to talk in depth here in a few minutes about what we are seeing inside of our businesses, but before that I thought I would take a look at what's going on in the markets and the regions. For the first quarter, we had -- I guess you get a really clear view of what we can deliver when you combine our ability to execute with some improved market conditions. We had organic revenue growth that was up 5%, really driven by outstanding execution in FMT which was up 6% organically, and HST which was up 5% and both of these delivered robust order growth as well. We had 5% order growth, organic order growth at FMT and 8% organic order growth at HST. FSD, a little bit of a different picture. We had 1% organic revenue growth. We had orders down 11% on an organic basis, but if you sieve [ph] through this, it's really due to some tough comps and the movement of some things late in the first quarter into the second quarter. So, overall, with FSD, no real concerns with the underlying order pattern. So, obviously, we are optimistic. We do remain a little bit cautious and I'm going to talk about that in a second. Some of the things that I think are out there that we just need to be mindful of. But our teams did a great job in the quarter. Overall, organic order growth was up 2% and organic revenue growth was up 5%, as I mentioned. Op margin was at 21.8%, which was up 120 basis points. Adjusted EPS was $1.03 which was up $0.14 or 16%. Cash flow was up 21% to $75 million, and I think importantly we did build $15 million of backlog in the quarter. Also in the quarter we did have about $5 million of restructuring cost, mainly around site consolidation, and this is all in support of the strategies that we have outlined about building some scale in our businesses and really driving long term competitive advantage, and our balance sheet is in great shape. We ended the quarter at about 1.7 times gross leverage and obviously very strong free cash flow. So taking a look at what's going on in the market in the regions around the world, first on the industrial side. As I mentioned, the industrial markets have improved across our regions. Importantly, in the North American industrial distribution, we had strength in the fourth quarter, late in the fourth quarter that has continued throughout the first quarter and really the first sustained rebound that we have seen here in some time. Energy remains somewhat mixed. Upstream has been good and we see that in our Band-It, in our sealing business, but as you know, that\u2019s a pretty small part of our overall business. The midstream has remained pretty muted. You will see strength in aviation, in our mobile business, but overall as you look at truck build, those are down, had a very warm winter, and so that\u2019s really been a mix. And that tends to lag anyway. Agriculture, we started to see signs of recovery. We started at the end of last year. I think it will be a slow pace, but generally the signs are positive. In scientific [fluidics] [ph], life sciences generally, continued strength in IVD, bio-analytical instrumentation and optics. And then finally on municipal. The trends have continued, kind of a steady Eddie market place and I think that will continue to be relatively decent for us. In terms of regions. North America really led the recovery. We saw strength across most businesses, most markets. And so those are favorable. In Europe, the conditions are also improved. Auto and housing have really been the two things that have led there. And generally we haven't seen any negative impact from Brexit, so a decent market in Europe. And then in Asia, the good story that we have had in India has continued and we did see some positive turn in China. So all this kind of adds up to some pretty good news and a more positive outlook certainly than we have had in some time, but I did want to talk about just a word of caution. So, obviously, we are happy with the broad-based improvements in the markets. Our team is executing very well. But I do want to be clear that I'm cautious about the overall outlook, and I am, as my personal view, is that the financial markets and the M&A markets have really fully priced in. That's good news. And the good news of improving demand, confidence levels are up. Obviously, low interest rates. And really up until the last week or so, I would say that the policy improvements of the U.S. had also been [prized] [ph], whether a tax reforms or infrastructure spending. While I don\u2019t think that a lot of the risks have really been fully accounted for the the potential issues that are out there, that could impact demand. And I think it's important to note, whether it's political conflict or policy gridlock in the U.S., or really what has turned into a regular unpredictable U.S. domestic and foreign policy. And the reason I mention this, it's not that we have any control and we are certainly not experts at any of this, but I think it creates volatility. So as I look at the back half of the year, it's still pretty hard to get your head around some of these major impacts that could happen out there. So I am pleased to the start with 2017. The outlook has improved. But I think we have to be mindful not to get over our skies for IDEX to control what we can control and understand both the upside and the downside of the full risk and reward basket. Okay. Let me talk a little bit about capital deployment. Obviously, it's a big piece to our overall story and our strategy remains the same with a focus on long-term organic growth investments, disciplined M&A, consistent dividends, and opportunistic share repurchases. On the organic growth side, we believe that we have meaningfully outpaced our markets obviously in this quarter but also during the industrial recession. We took share in many of our businesses. And so we have been committed to invest for long-term organic growth. That commitment is not going to change. We believe that superior organic growth is the key value driver in our company, and we are going to continue to invest in projects and people that make the most strategic sense to us. And that the series of investments that we talked about in detail on our last call, those have started. And we have really committed ourselves to making sure we are making the investments going forward. In terms of dividends, our policy of being in that 30% to 35% range. We are going to continue to be there over time. Share repurchases, we nibbled a little bit around the edges here in the first quarter, pretty small numbers, 82,000 shares that were bought back. And as you all know, we have a very disciplined methodology of how we think about share repurchases. It's about driving long-term value for our shareholders and we are going to keep that discipline. In terms of M&A, the M&A funnel is solid. Not different from what we talked about here a few months ago. And we are continuing to work that funnel. Prices obviously continue to be elevated and so we are going to be selective and targeted and make sure that we put money to work in ways that are going to create shareholder value. And obviously we are in a position with our balance sheet and our cash flow to execute that strategy fully here going forward. All right. Let me turn to the first quarter results. I am on Slide 4. Revenue in the quarter was $544 million, which was up 10% in total, 5% organically. As I mentioned, it was driven by 6% and 5% organic numbers in FMT and HST. It's worth mentioning, as I did earlier, this is the first time we have seen organic revenue growth since the end of 2014. So, obviously, I am very pleased by that. Orders were up 8% at $569 million, 2% organically. As I have mentioned earlier, FMT was up 5%, HST was up 8%. And so the underlying business have nice, strong order rates here as we move into the second quarter. We also have built $15 million of backlog in the quarter. The team did an excellent job of executing and March was a particularly strong month for us. And obviously you have seen with the flow through to the bottom line, they have done a nice job. When you adjust for $5 million of restructuring, op margin was at 21.8%, which was up 120 basis points. And obviously I am pleased with the strong execution by our teams. Cash flow was a great story. Up 21%, $75 million. Net income at $75 million or $0.99 on a GAAP basis and $1.03 or up $0.14, up 16% for the year on an adjusted basis. All right. Let me turn now to the different segments. I am on Slide 5 and we will start with fluid metering. So FMT had an excellent quarter. As I mentioned before, sales and orders were up 5% and 6% respectively. Op margin, when you adjust for $1.6 million of restructuring, was up 300 basis point in the quarter. Obviously great results and you are seeing the benefit of the restructure of that overall cost structure within FMT and the impacts that you get from the volume leverage when you see the business turn. Water continues to be a very good story. Municipal and industrial markets are solid. We are seeing some seasonal trends that point towards a good second quarter for that team. And in particular, I think they have done some of the best work in the company around new product development. So we have got a couple of new products here that have been launched that I think are going to be good news for water here throughout 2017 and into the future. In terms of industrial fluids. Obviously, all the trends that I talked about impact that business probably as much as any within IDEX. We have see nice increases in North American distribution. An uptick in upstream oil and gas, albeit a small piece. And then some firming in Europe in the gulf region. So a decent improvement there in industrial fluids. Energy, I already mentioned earlier. Aviation business, the project funnel is very healthy and the stationary market is doing well. The mobile market which is really around LPG, has been softer and really should be, we expect it will be through the balance of the year. And then Ag, as I mentioned before, nice start to the year. We have seen some improvements, it's a good sign. But we think that will be overall, relatively slow improvement. I am on Slide 6 now. Let talk about health and science. So like FMT, strong first quarter. Organic orders are up 8%. Revenue was up 5%. If you exclude the $3 million of restructuring charges, HST had a 90 basis point increase in the quarter. One of the questions I would assume we are going to get is why that actually wasn\u2019t a bigger increase in margins. And that\u2019s really due to the mix of businesses within that portfolio here in the second quarter. But still very nice performance obviously. Life science and optics. The analytical instrumentation business, bio IVD end markets, all continue to be solid. And we are seeing really nice business wins in new products through the combination of fluidics and optics. Sealing had a great quarter. Our acquisition of SFC has turned out quite nicely along with some very nice business wins in the semi-con market by our sealing team. We made a substantial investment a few years ago in new capacity in the United States, really to allow us to attack the semicon and the energy markets and that is paying off well. Just as kind of an interesting note, in terms of volume in our Brenham, Texas facility is up ten times what it was this time last year. Now, albeit that was a start up volume but they have just done terrific job of getting up the speed and servicing some very demanding and important customers. On the industrial side, much like FMT, a nice pickup in industrial distribution in North America in particular. And then in our materials process business, pharma and the nutrition markets have been decent and our consolidation of a number of those sites into one significant site in North America is going quite well. All right, our last segment. I am on Slide 7 and we will talk about diversified. Organic orders were down 11% in the quarter and sales were up 1%. Just, I think this is an important note because I am sure we will get some questions on this too. Really the order decrease was relative to a very strong order book last year in our dispensing business that we are going to comp against and the order that we expected to follow has got pushed into the second quarter. So you will see some lumpiness in here, both you will see in the order book here and then as we look at the second quarter, you will see some lumpiness on the sales side. So nothing from an underlying basis to be concerned about really this is the lumpiest segment that we have and that shows up from time to time. We did see a margin decrease of about 70 points, all due to the impact of acquisitions. So very much in line with what we expected. Dispensing obviously had a great year in 2016. Orders and sales are going to be down in dispensing. We are down in dispensing and as I mentioned, you see a large order got pushed into the second quarter. Generally the markets remain stable and we have just got a great competitive position in that business. Fire and safety had a really nice quarter. The overall project funnel is strong. OEM activity is strong. The combination of our legacy buyer business with Akron and AWG, that strategy is playing out. And Akron in particular has had just a really strong results here since we bought the business just about a year ago. Band-It. Band-It had a nice showing here. The energy business was up. Transportation was solid. Obviously the upstream improvement that helps us in Band-It. And then North American industrial market has seen improvements also like in other parts of our business. Okay. Let's conclude here with second quarter and full year guidance. I am on Slide 8. So for the second quarter, we are estimating EPS to be in the range of $1.04 to a $1.06. Revenue to be up 2% to 3% year-over-year. Margins, and again some of that has to do with the timing of some larger things that are getting pushed about quarter to quarter. Operating margins will be about 21.5% and the Q2 tax rate we except -- I see it to be very favorable at about 26.5%. In terms of full year. Based on our performance here in the first quarter and raising our outlook here a little bit for the second quarter. We are expecting $4 to $4.10 for the year in earnings. We are also increasing our overall growth rate expectations to 3% to 4% and margins to be at about 21.5%. We should have about one point of impact from FX for the year. Corporate costs would be around $66 million and no changes in expectation of conversion of free cash flow. Still should be about 120%. As always, our guidance doesn\u2019t include any impact of acquisitions or restructuring as we think about the balance of the year. So with that, Brenda, operator, I am going to stop here and turn it over for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Scott Graham with BMO. Please go ahead with your question. Unidentified Analyst : This is [Katya] [ph] for Scott Graham. Could you discuss a little bit about what pricing for the company in first quarter was? Andrew Silvernail : You know, very consistent, Katya, was what we have seen here in the past, which is about a point. So not a big deviation from what we have seen, and so pretty consistent with what we have seen over time. Unidentified Analyst : And what about the inflation offset? Andrew Silvernail : You know, actually we haven't seen a lot of inflation yet. I will note that obviously around some of the commodities have started to inch up. We do expect that that will start to be a bigger issue as we go through the year. Obviously, we have planned for it and we are mindful of the fact that with the improvement in outlook, you are likely to see some improvement or some increases in commodity prices. But generally, nothing has been a major offset yet. Bill, anything you would add on that? William Grogan : I mean as we continue to monitor about inflation, we look for opportunities to pass on the cost. Andrew Silvernail : Yes. We are really -- this is pretty high on our list, Katya about making sure we don\u2019t get behind an inflation curve if that starts to pick up. And our expectation is it is going to, right. And so that\u2019s something that is very high on our priority list as we look at the balance of 2017. Unidentified Analyst : Just one more question, sorry about that. Can you discuss -- it looks like corporate expenses looks lower for the rest of the year. Can you discuss why? Andrew Silvernail : No, it's pretty consistent. It is not meaningfully different from what we have talked about in the past. It's got 16 million-16.5 million in the quarter, plus or minus. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please go ahead with your question. Adam Farley : This is Adam Farley on for Nathan. Andrew Silvernail : You guys are all tricking us here this morning. Adam Farley : First question\u2019s on North American industrial. You called out in the press release that there was some improvement in larger capital projects. What markets are driving this improvement specifically related to the larger capital [projects] [ph]. Andrew Silvernail : It's actually pretty broad-based. Energy is a place that we have seen more of it, meaning upstream energy. We haven't started seeing it in the midstream yet, so to speak. But I think you are not seeing one place for your massive investment and not seeing in others. You are starting to see it. Now to be clear, right, it's not huge capital investment, it\u2019s things that are just their larger projects that are starting to move through the pipeline. Adam Farley : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Turning to gross margins. What are the sources of gross margin improvement? Is it COGS reduction, value pricing, maybe new product releases or all of the above. Andrew Silvernail : It's actually -- it is all of the above. Pricing is about what we expected it to be, plus or minus. I mentioned when Katya asked a question, a point. The math is actually a little bit less than a point in the first quarter. But that\u2019s about what we expected. You are getting some, obviously with our business, specifically FMT, you get a lot of volume leverage. These are very high contribution margin businesses, so you have seen the improvement there. And then just on an ongoing basis, the work that we have done around segmenting our portfolio and specifically our fixed businesses, we are getting more overall leverage in those businesses than we have in the past. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Mike Halloran with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead with your question. Mike Halloran : It's actually me. So first on sustainability here. Obviously, the confidence levels seems a lot higher , Andy, based on what you have seen over the last couple of quarters, I think three quarters in a row now of positive organic orders. Maybe take a layer deeper and just talk about how much you think is inventory replenishment, how much is going right to the end market demand? The project activity that you just commented on being broad-based seems favorable from a sustainability perspective, but maybe anything underneath there? And then also just how have things trended through the quarter through April? It sounds like March was good but some cadence on that too. Andrew Silvernail : Mike, let me -- and I will start there. So March was really good, to be clear. Right. So I think when we got here the last time, our last call, we had mentioned that January had started well. January was a strong month for us. To be honest with you, February was kind of muted. And so part of my cautionary tone in my earlier prepared comments is when you look at our order book over the last three quarters, it's not like through any quarter we have had kind of sustained strength. You still see spottiness. So I am mindful of that. But March was really strong both in terms of orders and our ability to execute frankly. In terms of overall, kind of peeling back the onion, so to speak. The improvements that we saw were pretty broad based. And so it's not a singular market, and so obviously our life sciences businesses have been taller here for a long time and what we really saw -- what we have seen here in the last two quarters, specifically this quarter, is improvement in the core industrial business, the general industrial is kind of the big difference between now and six months ago. And we are seeing that across different businesses. In terms of it being inventory, do I think that some of it is inventory? I think it is probably a little bit, but as I have mentioned in the past, the stocking and de-stocking, it doesn\u2019t impact us as much as it does I think in some other businesses. A lot of that has to do with -- we are doing a lot of value added stuff so we don\u2019t have a ton of general products, right, of off the shelf stuff. So we don\u2019t see that quite as much as maybe some others do. So I think it is more demand. That being said, what you do see in times likes these is people, where you do have [conbonds] [ph] customer [conbond] [ph]. You see them changing those levels, right. So they are going to take on more stock because they have got to meet more volatility of demand. So there is a little bit of that but I would say generally it's an improvement in market demand. Mike Halloran : Makes a lot of sense. And then on the margin side. Historically we have always talked about how organic -- as organic revenue accelerates so too does that drop through for you guys. Put a nice drop in the quarter. When you look at the rest of the year, 1Q margins on a op basis are a little bit ahead of what the median for '17 looks like. So maybe talk about how the margins you expect through the year? Was there something in the first quarter besides maybe really the mix? Something else that drove, something that\u2019s not repeatable as go -- moving forward? Or is there some level of conservatism being baked in? Some thoughts there would be great. Andrew Silvernail : You know, Mike, we are only about 30 bps off of what we are talking about for the year. So it's not a big number, right. Number one. And that can flex a lot. If you look at the FMT margins, the FMT margins were very positively impacted by mix in this quarter and so up 300 basis points too. We do think that that we have definitely taken a step function, or not step function but another step in where our sustainable margins are. We do think we have reached a new level there. But we did have pretty favorable mix in FMT. In HST actually we had kind of negative mix. Our ceiling business had a really strong quarter and that\u2019s from the lower end, still quite good, but it's on the lower end of margin mix. And so when I look at the year, that plus or minus 21.5%, that feels pretty good, the 21.8%. That\u2019s within striking distance of that 21.5%. Not a big difference. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Charlie Brady with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : This is actually [Patrick] [ph] standing on for Charles. Just wanted to touch a little bit on growth investments. I think the last quarter you got top line [indiscernible] investments are around 11%, sort of a headwind on the bottom line, I guess, was for '17. How much of that has been realized in the first quarter and how should we think about how that is progressing the management thinking. This can potentially change now with higher growth, organic growth expected with that. Andrew Silvernail : So we are right on track. The spending that we had planned in the first quarter to ramp that has happened. So nothing surprising there. And so I don\u2019t see us -- from those planned investments, they are going to happen very much like we have outlined. With a little bit better environment, obviously will push you harder around investments. And so if what we have seen here in the first quarter sustain, I would expect that some of the investments will increase over the year. Not big numbers, Patrick, but I would expect us to make some further investments. Unidentified Analyst : But I guess that number, the 11% number, probably would change even if you are thinking... Andrew Silvernail : No, no. Yes, in terms of how it impacts our margin structure, no. Unidentified Analyst : And can you maybe just talk a little bit more about, I guess sort of on that front. Some of the new product rollouts that you guys have. Maybe you have already done following the first quarter and sort of throughout the rest of the quarters here. Andrew Silvernail : Yes. So it's pretty broad-based, right. So if you look at new products, we have the whole host of products that are launching in conjunction with our customers scientific fluidics. And those are things that take years to develop, right. And so we expected those to really kick in in '17. We have seen that happen. In our water business we have two significant new product launches around -- one on the meter side and one on the sewer pipeline side. We have a new product investment in [indiscernible] coming from our Viking business, and in dispensing we have got the next generation. As you know, the X-Smart has been excellent and a great product for us. And we are launching kind of the next phase of that which is in to the next level up market segment that we have been playing again for some time. So those are all kind of moving ahead. And these are things that have been in the pipeline for a long time for us. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Great. That\u2019s good color. I guess just one more. I think you talked a little bit about sort of order rate, February being a little muted and March being probably little bit better than you expected. What is sort of the exit rate, I guess, for the orders coming out of March and what are these [indiscernible] are for the first, like 20 days of April. Andrew Silvernail : Yes. It's fine. Orders have been kind of in line with our expectation in April. So no big deviation. March was definitely stronger than we had expected but February was softer, right. And so month to month orders, we obviously pay attention to it. I think the thing matters more to me now is the fact that we still see the volatility. So we have obviously the tone here in both in our release and our prepared remarks and what not. Obviously the tone is more positive. But that\u2019s one of the reasons that I remain a little bit cautious is that volatility is still there. Certainly we are in a better position than we were 90 days ago in terms of our confidence level. But there is still volatility. Unidentified Analyst : And that orders that you mentioned in FST, that\u2019s being pushed into the second quarter. Is that -- I mean I know you said it's timing related, but what is the reason. Is that the customer has pulled back on that or? Andrew Silvernail : Yes. The customer chooses. It's a matter of their readiness. So it's nothing I am concerned about. It's just -- we don\u2019t have a lot of things that are on the larger side. And when things move by a few weeks, it has an impact. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Allison Poliniak : Can I just go back to the margin assumption question that somebody had had. You talked about mix in FMT being more favorable in Q1. How should we think of that for the rest of the year and with our specific vertical with that mix that was driving that? Andrew Silvernail : I don\u2019t know that it's going to be as good as that for the year. And some of it's mix versus expectations but ag was better than we thought it was going to be, Allison. And as you know that\u2019s very favorable for us. So that was kind of one that was better than expectation. And then when you peel back the business, as you know we have got a few brands that just have much higher contribution margins. I am thinking of the Viking and [indiscernible] is an example, right. And they had a better quarter. In terms of, for the balance of the year, again, I think in total we are in striking distance of kind of overall what we expected. Allison Poliniak : Okay. That\u2019s great. And then just your comments around obviously the rest out there. You bring forward the question about the sustainability or the early stage of the recovery. Obviously, order is great. You seem comfortable with the near-term outlook. But as you talk to your customers, is there a specific market that you are more concerned about the sustainability. I understand your concerns but I guess what are you seeing, I guess, from your customers that could be driving some of that. Andrew Silvernail : I don\u2019t have a specific -- I will not put my finger on anything specific. It's just much more -- I think your term early stage is a good way to put that in the industrial side. And there is we are literally six months out of a horrible industrial recession and so I am cautious about that and I am cautious about the [validity] [ph] of it. With a lot of things that are still pretty unpredictable out there and with a lot of positivity priced in, and I don\u2019t mean just in the stock market but priced into confidence. And even in the last couple of weeks we have seen some of that, the negative side of that. And I am just -- I feel better about what we are seeing, no doubt about it. But I think we are very prudent to continue to manage our business for expected volatility. Allison Poliniak : That\u2019s great. And then just on FMT and water. You highlighted a lot of the new products. Strong order growth there. I don\u2019t know, is there a way to parse out that. You are driving maybe above market order growth because of some of these new products. I don\u2019t know, how you...? Andrew Silvernail : I think so. So if you kind of take the -- let's just kind of take 5% growth and let's not take 5%, let's say 3% to 4% for the year, right. And you say how much of that you believe is just underlying market and how much of that is us outperforming the market. I think a combination of customer focus, meaning really around our segmentation work on new products, I think that\u2019s going to get us a point or two above the underlying market. And so if you are three to four, I think we are going to get one to two of that where we are going to outperform our new products and customer focus, and the balance of that is going to be how the market has performed. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Mishan : Starting off with HST. Could you maybe parse out a little bit around the order growth? What really drove the inflection to the 8% increase? Was it an increase in sealing, life sciences or like MPT? Andrew Silvernail : So the industrial side was decent. The most strength came out of sealing followed by scientific fluidics and optics. So those two were really the stronger pieces. Sealing was by far the strongest grower in the quarter and has a little bit of that negative mix I talked about. Still quite good, don\u2019t get me wrong. But just from an overall mix perspective, it's negative to the segment. Matthew Mishan : And then you have been talking about, I guess, very strong products like in fluidics and optics in 2017 and 2018. Can we maybe talk about some of the advancements that are driving that for your customers? Andrew Silvernail : The story is very very similar which is, it's really around our ability to bring an approved fluidic system into the whole host of customers. Whether it's IVD, bio, analytical instrumentation. You see those things the same but we are kind of taking more real estate and that is driven by really performance. And that\u2019s a combination of our ability to move smaller things at higher pressures, higher quality and then the integration of optics and fluidics. So those are really the things that come together. And obviously that was a piece of thesis many years ago in bringing those businesses together and we are seeing that play itself through. Matthew Mishan : Okay. Great. And then if I could just squeeze one last one. There was a large MPT order in 4Q. Did that ship in the first quarter and how much of the growth would be attributed to that? Andrew Silvernail : Most of the second quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with Alembic Global Advisors. Please go ahead with your question. Matt Summerville : Maybe just dig a little bit deeper into what you are seeing in the fire business. If you could part suppression versus safety and maybe provide a little bit of geographic color around that. I know in the last year there were some regions that were a bit more challenged than others. And then also can you speak to -- kind of provide an update on the fire acquisitions you made during 2016. I know you have kind of anniversaried Akron Brass at this point. So how you are performing in terms of driving margin improvement integration etcetera. Andrew Silvernail : Matt, maybe I will start there. So the Akron integration has gone really well and certainly we are little bit better than our expectation and we had pretty aggressive expectations. And that\u2019s gone well. That\u2019s gone well on a number of levels. The product side, the channel side, obviously an improved cost structure. We are -- the thesis there, if you recall, was really bringing together, you know to close the loop with high value content on a fire truck and then electronics will increasingly play a bigger role. That\u2019s not big yet but it will be an important piece of that. So that\u2019s certainly at or above our expectation. In terms of the overall growth probably the biggest, I would say net positive compared to our expectations is the Chinese business has improved. Tenders which have been held off for quite some time have been released and we have won those. And by the way we have won competitive share there. So that\u2019s probably the biggest thing in that overall fire and safety business. Matt Summerville : And then just one more follow up on FMT. I know you kind of talked about the margins a little bit. Maybe I will use the term that you sort of back off a little bit and the step function. If you go back 12 to 24 months ago, you are in the 23% to 24% margin bandwidth. And now for the last two quarters you have been above 27%. I guess when you think about the mix dynamics in the business, what you deal going forward is the right sort of high low bandwidth on that business. Andrew Silvernail : Yes. So I think in that 26%, 27% around FMT, that\u2019s probably a bigger number here assuming kind of constant volumes generally. I think we are that range now. And you are right. The reason I corrected myself because I think step function is too greater term. But we have definitely made some movement. And that\u2019s happened around a couple of things. Number one, as you know we had those businesses that we define as fixed. Probably the greatest proportion of those sat by FMT and that team really led by [indiscernible]. They have done a great job. There is lot of buying, they have done a terrific job. And by the way, they have done while launching new product, right. So very, very happy with that. But also within some of our bigger brands. If you look at the Viking brand or the [indiscernible] brand or even to a degree if you look at [indiscernible] that had a huge headwind. They held their own with pretty big headwind. And so we have made improvements in those businesses while they were facing peak to trough double digit headwinds, right. And they held their own. And so when you get to volume back in those things, it flows through to the bottom. So I will give Eric Ashleman, who is there COO, an awful lot of credit here with really driving that focus in the FMT businesses and helping them get to the kind of margin structure we expect. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead with your question. Brett Linzey : Just wanted to come back to the 2017 guide. So you are taking up the organic growth forecast, maintaining the point estimate on margins. Surprising, you are not getting a little bit better leverage there. If were to just adjust for investments in some of the M&A noise, where are the volume based incrementals that you are assuming for the business for 2017. Andrew Silvernail : Boy, I would have to parse that through, right, in total. Separating out the new investments versus, as if you didn\u2019t do new investments, what you get for leverage. That\u2019s a tough one, right, to parse out. I think that the overall flow throughs that we are getting are very much in line with our expectations. I don\u2019t see any big deviation from what we have thought about, talked about over time. Brett Linzey : Okay. And then just back to some of the energy commentary. It sounds like it's still relatively muted overall. Could you just talk about what the order flow rates were in the quarter here into April, and was that total oil and gas business up in the quarter on a sales basis. Andrew Silvernail : Well, Brett, you got to break that down a little bit because when we talk about energy, we have got our businesses that are -- liquid controls is an example. Our [indiscernible] brands. And those are by and large that all they do is energy. And then you have got pieces of sealing, of Band-It, of Viking that were in rough. That all touched that. So let me kind of break it down into what's kind of happening in the segment of the energy business. What I mean is, upstream, very strong, right. It doesn\u2019t matter kind of what part of our business we are touching. But that\u2019s only 2%, 3% of our IDEX volume. But that\u2019s been up very very nicely. The midstream side is the part that\u2019s much more muted and that\u2019s really around LPG and that has to do with truck build. That\u2019s the part that\u2019s still soft and given what we see and the outlook of truck build, and we are pretty close to those customers, that\u2019s not going to get better here and we don\u2019t think for the balance of this year. So that\u2019s how I would separate it out. Brett Linzey : Okay. No, that helps. And just one more. Back to FS and DP. Do you have any sense as to or could you maybe quantify what the delta impact was on orders on those large projects last year. How large they were and then-- Andrew Silvernail : You mean comparison? Brett Linzey : Yes, the comparison. And then also what was the size of these projects that got shifted from Q1 into Q2? Andrew Silvernail : So you are talking -- it's of $10 million in total, right. And I am talking about what the comp and the push. So the tough comp to last year and the push to this year. That\u2019s the kind of magnitude you are talking about. Brett Linzey : Okay. So underlying orders were still relatively okay. Andrew Silvernail : Good. Bill, will you add to that? William Grogan : Yes. No, I would say fire and rescue was strong for the quarter as well as Band-It. Dispensing was the outlier relative to just host couple of projects that moved. So underlying order rates if you excluded that will be in line with the balance of the portfolio. Brett Linzey : And Brett also when you look at the second quarter and you go, why is your organic point going to be 2 to 3 after coming off of 5. That\u2019s part of what you are going to comp against. It's you are going to have that lumpiness is going to -- you got kind an orders lumpiness that hits you here and then you get a sales lumpiness that hits you in the second quarter. They will be creative on the order side from that in the second quarter but we are going to be hit on the sales side. That\u2019s where we have put them, Bill. Operator : Our next question comes from Bhupender Bohra with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Bhupender Bohra : So just a question on -- when we look at the margins here, especially FMT, we have 300 bps improvement year-over-year. And historically, I think even in this release you guys talked about product activity. Can you give us some clarity like how much mix was? How much product activity actually benefitted margins overall in that particular business. I think you have pointed that as one of the margin improvements. Andrew Silvernail : So it's the -- no, go ahead. William Grogan : Maybe I would say, we have seen ratable improvement within our FMT margins over the last six months. As Andy talked about, some of the focused actions we have taken on some of the fixed business. So I think our underlying target is probably close to that 27% rate and then you are going to fluctuate off of that based upon the mix within the portfolio. So I think kind of fundamental improvements have gotten us close to that 27% and the mix will vary slightly off of that. Andrew Silvernail : But in terms of splitting it between productivity and volume leverage, the [indiscernible] hand is in. Right. So you are talking about a business that in general is north of 65% contribution margin. And the key is as the volume comes back, we don\u2019t have to add fixed cost at nearly the rate. Right. And that really kind of comes into productivity in and of itself. So they really go hand in hand, Bhupender. Bhupender Bohra : Okay. So if I had to bucket that 300 bps improvement year-over-year, you would say like two-third kind of top line volume leverage and mix, and then one-third would be productivity kind of thing. Would that be fair? William Grogan : You get price in their too, so. Bhupender Bohra : Okay. Andrew Silvernail : Yes. It's pricing in there. Honestly, we are probably getting to fine a level of detail to share probably. We don\u2019t really get into that level of detail. But I think generally, right, the big impact here in the quarter that\u2019s different from what you have seen in the last year is that change in leverage. Bhupender Bohra : Okay. Got it. And as we go into the rest of 2017, as you have improved your organic guidance here, could you just talk about some of the end markets from all the three business perspective where you think -- which you think are going to be more -- little bit more positive from your perspective. You think there will be some incremental improvement or where you see headwind, if any, basically? Andrew Silvernail : I think that the biggest difference from where we talked about a couple of months ago here, it's really around North American industrial. That\u2019s the biggest inflection of anything that we have. And that shows up in FMT and in HST, right. It shows up, you see kind of the strength. The other place that obviously was a big differentiator for us within HST was of course the wins with semicon. And semicon has been good for us generally, the market has been decent. But the team has done an exceptional job of focusing in on a handful of core customers and on applications where we can really differentiate. And we have backed that up with major investment, right. So when we opened our new facility in Texas here a couple of years ago, it was all about our ability to win in the North American semicon and North American energy market. And obviously energy has been tough in the last few years but that thesis and that strategy has played itself out. So they are winning and they are winning well there. And that what's been a little bit loss in the shuffle. Although I did touch on it earlier. You know the team in scientific fluidics and optics, they saw this refresh. This 2017-2018 product cycle refresh years ago. And what they have done, what that team has done to be inside our customers to have concurrent engineering happening, we told you that\u2019s about a year and half ago that this was going to happen and it's happening. And so the growth that they are getting is really from years and years of executing their strategy of more high value content by solving those customers critical problems. So they have just done a terrific job and it's paying out. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC. Please go ahead with your question. Unidentified Analyst : This is [Jeff Reeve] [ph] on for Deane Dray. My question is more about your M&A pipeline. I am just curious how it's looking and which segments you are primarily focused on and if you have any other divestitures or portfolio pruning actions in pipeline. Andrew Silvernail : Well, Jeff, maybe we will start there. So we don\u2019t ever really get into the specifics about pruning but as I said in the past, we have done the vast majority of things that we are going to do from that perspective. And I think it's played out well and so generally I don\u2019t expect to see us in the divestiture again in any major way here going forward. In terms of the M&A pipeline, it looks really similar to what it did back when we talked about the fourth quarter. You know it's robust in the sense that we have got a lot of target that we are working. I would say the private equity side, that\u2019s been strong, which obviously gives you a little bit of caution because if the amount of stuff that\u2019s been sold. And then prices are elevated. As markets improves, people's expectations raise and I think that being very very disciplined here is smart for us. So having a balanced capital allocation strategy is very important in these kind of markets. And buying businesses like SXT, like Akron, like AWG, that are in our sweet spot. And working those things really consistently, that\u2019s how we are going to be successful. And so we are going to be very disciplined and we are going to be very consistent and over time we are going to put our balance sheet and our cash flows to work but it is going to be in a very disciplined way. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And a final follow on to that with equity valuation elevated as you said. Could we possibly see more acquisitions utilizing your own equity? Andrew Silvernail : I guess, maybe I will answer that in a very big picture. I am not wholly against this. We would use equity if it made sense. The number of situations where I can possibly see us doing that are really really small. And obviously we have got the balance sheet and free cash flow that it would have to be a pretty special situation and obviously if we get more leverage by using our balance sheet. And so that would obviously be our first choice. But to say I would never use equity, that would be too strong. I would use it in the right situation. Operator : Thank you. At this time we have no further questions. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Andy Silvernail for closing comments. Andrew Silvernail : Well, thank you all again for joining us here in our first quarter conference call. Obviously, I am really proud of how our teams have executed. They have done a terrific job when we had headwinds here for two, two and half years. I am really proud of what they have got done. And, yes, we are seeing some improvement in outlook and I am glad we have had the ability to raise our guidance and our expectation. I still remain cautious and I think we are all, it's all smart of us to not get it over our skis and our job is to execute for our shareholders. I appreciate the ownership, I appreciate the focus and we look forward to talk to you here in 90 days. Take care. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.",

With that, I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Andy Silvernail. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us here in our second quarter conference call. Look, the first and second quarters were very positive, and they produced strong results here in the first half of the year. And I'm pleased with the way the team continues to capitalize on the rebounding economy and successfully execute our growth strategy and is setting us up for what we think is going to be mid-single-digit organic growth here for all of 2017. In the second quarter, we had pretty broad-based overall performance. There are only a couple of pockets that were soft. But really as we think about the strength so far in our businesses and the sustained economic outlook, we think the operating results for the balance of the year are going to be very solid. As I mentioned, there are a few pockets of weakness in our portfolio, primarily around Midstream Energy. We've talked about this quite a bit in the last couple of calls, where the midstream really lagged the improvement in upstream. We are seeing \u2013 we have continued to see improvement in the upstream, but the midstream is still soft. But I will say that there's some evidence of a bottoming, and we're prepared for the market here to improve in the second half of the year. I'll provide more details as I walk through the markets and the segments here in a little bit. But overall, look, it was a strong quarter and we're very pleased with the results for the first half. Orders were really strong in all three segments. They were up 11% overall, 9% organically. HST delivered organic order growth of 11%, FMT had organic order growth of 9%, and FSD had organic growth of 7%. So all three segments really showing a nice order progress. We also built $12 million of backlog in the second quarter. And for those of you who have known the story for a long time, you'll know that, that is not typical for us. We typically burn our backlog in the second quarter. So this sets us up well here going into the second half. Organic revenue was up 3%, driven by HST, which was up 6% organically. And FMT, which was up 4% organically. FSD was down 1% organically in terms of sales for the quarter, but that was really entirely due to a project delay in the North American dispensing market. We did see a nice ratable increase in sales and orders throughout the quarter, and it's what we like to see as we move through the quarter, and we saw that strength as we moved from April to May to June. Flow through was 36.8% when we adjusted for the $2.6 million of net charges compared to the prior year. And look, the teams did an excellent job in the second quarter, and we saw that in the results. As I mentioned, organic orders and sales were up 9% and 3%, respectively. Op margin was 21.8%, which was up 110 basis points. EPS was $1.08, which was up $0.09 or 9% for the quarter, and free cash flow was $78 million. We increased our gross margin by 40 basis points to 44.8%. However, if we back out the $3.6 million of fair value inventory step-up compared to prior period, it was down about 30 basis points, and this is due to some increased investments in engineering that we had in the quarter, really, around accelerating growth and some \u2013 a few pockets of inefficiencies in our supply chain. That I'll talk about here in a few moments. We also increased our quarterly dividend by 9% to $0.37 in the second quarter. Let me take a minute here and as I usually do talk about what we're seeing in our markets and in the regions around the world. Industrial distribution, look, it continues to be steady. We see continuous signs of recovery, really, in all markets around the globe. Energy, as I mentioned, a minute ago, was a mixed bag. Upstream is strong, if you look at our BAND-IT and our Sealing businesses. But in FMT, in the midstream applications, it has generally lagged. And as I said, I think we're seeing a bottom, and I believe we'll see some improvement here in the back half. Ag has been a great story. Our Banjo business has been very strong, up double-digits so a really nice recovery. Life sciences \u2013 Scientific Fluidics and Optics continues to be a market stronghold for us. We've talked about a lot that the nice product cycle is moving through that industry right now, and we're doing well within that. Semicon has also been strong, and we're winning share there. Municipal end markets in both Water and Fire continue to be positive. If we turn to the regional look; North America, I think we all know that the silliness that we're seeing in the political landscape in the U.S., kind of regardless of that, we're continuing to lead the recovery around the world. We've seen strength in most of our markets including transportation, semicon, industrial distribution, agriculture, life sciences, and upstream oil and gas. Europe continues to improve. There are some pressures from the strengthening U.S. dollar, but generally in the core markets, those are doing well. Same can be said for Asia. There have been some stumbles in India with the change in tax laws, but we think that's a short-term thing, and we benefit from this going forward. So just a few comments on capital deployment before I get into the operating results and the segment discussions. Our strategy remains the same. We have an emphasis on long-term organic growth, disciplined M&A, consistent dividends, and opportunistic share repurchases. On the organic growth side, I think you're seeing the benefits of the investments we've been making. The teams have done an excellent job in terms of executing our strategies, around targeted growth and new product development, and we've seen strong organic growth certainly in the orders side for the first half of the year, and we think that plays out into the second half. Dividends, as I mentioned, we increased our dividend by 9% to $0.37 a quarter here in April. Share repurchases, we bought back about $2 million of stock in the quarter, 24,000 shares. And as you know, we think of share repurchases as a tool for driving long-term shareholder value for the company, and we'll do so when that makes sense. In terms of M&A, our funnel of opportunities is good, and has actually improved a little bit here through the second quarter, and we'll continue to look for and execute on deals that are going to drive long-term shareholder value. Our financial position is outstanding. We paid off our U.S. revolver here in the second quarter. Our debt-to-cap is 28%, our net leverage is 1.2 times, our gross leverage is 1.5 times. So you combine our balance sheet and our strong cash flows, and we are in a very nice position around capital deployment. Okay, let's switch gears here. Let's turn to Page 4, and let's talk to the financial results. In Q2, we had revenue that was $573 million. As I've mentioned, that was 4% \u2013 up 4% overall, 3% organically. That's driven by HST, which was up 6%, in terms of organic growth in FMT, which was up 4%. Orders were $586 million, which up 11% overall, 9% organically. As I mentioned before, all three segments delivered organic order growth : HST, up 11%; FMT, up 9%; FSD, up 7%. Q2 net income was $84 million. It was made for $1.08 a share, which was up $0.09 or 9% from the prior year. As we discussed in January, look, we're making growth investments, and we're committed to new product development and funding our growth initiatives around the world. In the first half, if you look at our engineering spend, which includes all aspects of engineering including R&D, our product engineering and applications engineering, that spend was up 14% year-over-year. Op margin was 21.8% for the quarter, up 110 basis points. And as I mentioned, this was really driven by volume leverage, benefits of our prior restructuring, and we did have also the benefit of a $2.6 million in cost from last year that we did not have this year. Free cash flow was $78 million, which was at 93% of net income. This was down slightly from the second quarter of last year compared \u2013 if you just look at the impact that were around tax payments. We had higher tax payments this second quarter versus last year. We did have a little bit of higher working capital as we're seeing some growth, although, our capital efficiency remains quite good. And we did have some increased CapEx. And just \u2013 I ask you to remember that on a year-to-date basis, our free cash flow was up 8% year-over-year. Okay, let's turn to the segment discussions. And we'll start with Fluid & Metering. I'm on Slide 5. For the second quarter in a row, FMT had a very solid quarter. Organic orders and sales were up 9% and 4%, respectively. Op margin was up 270 basis points, primarily due to volume leverage on the organic growth, some impacts of our restructuring savings and also little bit lower amortization. Water remains a good story; we have strength in our U.S. distribution and municipal end markets. Sales were actually up on an apples-to-apples basis, but on a reported basis, they were down a little bit. Just remember, we did have some divestitures in that area. The team has done just an outstanding job around new product development, which continues to drive the organic growth success. If you look at industrial fluids, the Pump businesses, the Viking and Warren Rupp, in particular, very strong double-digit increases year-over-year. Our targeted growth initiatives around LACT skids in upstream oil and gas with the Viking brands has been just outstanding and the industrial markets overall are solid. The Valves business is stable and improving. We have seen orders and sales growth a little bit offset by FX as the dollar has strengthened against the euro. Energy, I've already talked about. But in particular, the LPG mobile market, we have seen softness. We are seeing what we believe is a bottom there. So we think we will see some improvement here in the second half. And our aviation project funnel is in really good shape, and I think positions the business well here in the back half of 2017. Agriculture, a good story through the second quarter, it got better in the first quarter \u2013 rather it got better in the second. And we think we're going to continue to see strong global demand and double-digit orders and sales growth. With that, let's turn to Health & Science. I'm on Slide 6. Similar to FMT, HST had two strong \u2013 has had two strong quarters in a row of organic order growth, it was up 11% in the quarter and sales were up 6% over last year. Op margin was up 60 basis points, mainly due to restructuring activities and higher volume. The Life Science and Optics businesses, Fluids and Optics, really strong across our major markets, AI, Bio IVD and DNA sequencing. As we've talked about, there's a nice overall new product funnel that is coming into the marketplace, and we have won share on most major platforms; so it's a good story for us. Our Sealings business, we're seeing record levels of production in our Blackburn facility in England. We've had organic orders and revenues up double digits there. The SFC acquisition is exceeding our plan, and we're ahead of our original deal model. As I mentioned, the semicon market continues to be strong as is oil and gas and our investment in a new facility in Texas here has proven to be a winner for us. And we are seeing some life in the heavy-equipment market, so some improvement there. HST industrial overall, that marketplace is stable and the Material Process technology, we're seeing strength in pharma and nutrition. We have finished our site consolidation, which did drive some inefficiencies here in the second quarter, but we think we cleaned that up going into the third quarter and the back-end of the year and really start to pivot towards growth in those businesses. I'm on the last segment, Diversified, I'm on Slide 7, had organic orders up 7% for the quarter. Organic sales were down 1% and really, entirely due to a delay in an order in dispensing. Operating margins were up 80 basis points, primarily due to the inventory step-up for Akron Brass, partially offset by dilutive impact to margins \u2013 excuse me, from the dilutive impact of margins from prior year acquisitions. In terms of dispensing, we did have a relatively large order. We talked about last quarter, it got pushed out, and so we did not recognize that order or sales in the second quarter. And we have seen the X-SMART product start to plateau. That's has been really a home run for us, but we are starting to see reaching peak levels there. And so as we look at our new product initiatives that are coming out in the back half of the year, that should help us accelerate growth in this platform in the future. The Asian and European markets are performing better than expected in dispensing, although we are seeing some impact from FX. In terms of Fire & Safety, excellent wins in rescue tools and fire pumps. Another strong quarter here for this group. OEM and municipal markets, while they are solid themselves, we are absolutely winning share. The European market has had some recovery. In the Akron Brass and AWG, we are well on our way of delivering on our promise of 500 basis points of margin improvement in those businesses. And then, finally, BAND-IT. Look, we had really good quarter for BAND-IT. We saw a rebound in energy, and we've continued to win share. Transportation and the industrial markets have done well, and so we're seeing a nice bounce back here for BAND-IT. All right. I'm on final slide here, Slide 8, and I'll give you an update on Q3 and full year guidance. So for Q3, we think EPS is going to be $1.04 to $1.06. Organic revenue is expected to be about 6%, operating margin's around 21.8%. The Q3 tax rate should be about 26.5%. FX we think will be flat for the quarter, and corporate costs should be about $17 million. For the year, based on the first half performance, the strength of our order intake in Q2 and I think a solid overall rebound in the markets. We're expecting to take our full-year guidance up. We were at $4 to $4.10, and we're taking that now, $4.18 to $4.23. We're also increasing our full-year organic revenue expectations to 5%, and full-year operating margin to about 21.8%. We expect FX to have less than 1% headwind for us for the year. Corporate costs should be around $68 million and free cash flow at about 120% of net income. Finally, as always, we have not included the impact of any future acquisitions or potential cost of restructurings that may happen here in the future. With that, let me pause, Doug, operator, I'll turn it over to you, and we'll open it up to questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, guys. Good morning. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Hey, Allison. Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Andy, just want to talk \u2013 you talked or mentioned quite a bit, market share gains driving some of that order acceleration pretty much across all the segments, and you guys have done a lot of investing over the years to get to this point. Is there any way to help us understand, I mean, I know it might be a little difficult, in terms of market share gains, is it 1%, is it 2% above market? Any generalization or color that you can give us there? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yeah. I think we actually did a little bit of work here, maybe a little bit deeper than we had in the past, in advance to this call, we assume that this would be something people want to talk about. From an order perspective, if we \u2013 we broke it down along our major businesses, and what we are estimating is about half of what we're seeing in order growth is coming from market and about half is discrete win that we can put our finger on, kind of, really clearly that we can walk through. You've got some big ones around \u2013 some big wins that have happened in \u2013 around Life Sciences, in the Scientific Fluidics & Optics. You've got some other big wins around Viking, the LACT skids investment has been a big win for us, our Water businesses generally. There, it's more kind of singles, buns and singles that we're winning. It's not one big new product but you add that up together, and those are some good numbers. So those three areas, in particular, are the big drivers. But right now, if you look at that 9% organic order growth, we think about half of it is market and about half of it is discretely from our initiatives. Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : That's great. And then, as I look to the segment margins in the context of your overall corporate margin targets out there for the \u2013 your outlook, is there any mix \u2013 outside of volume, any mix issues either way by segment that we should be wary of as we do our models here? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: I don't think so, Allison. It was \u2013 the overall mix equation was pretty stable for the most part. So if you kind of look at how few things played out, it had some pretty big puts and takes within HST. And what I mean by that is, you had really strong growth in life sciences, which is better-than-average margins, and you also had really strong growth in Sealing, which is a little bit lower, just because they have more amortization there. And then we did have some inefficiencies, as I said in supply chain. If you look at where those came to, it was about $3 million of inefficiencies that we can put our finger on as we saw some growth accelerate, and we had to do some catch up in supply chain, mostly around HST. But we think we'll get those cleaned up through the balance of the year. Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great, thanks. That's helpful. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yeah. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Hi, Nathan. Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I'm going to follow-up a little bit on Allison's growth investment questions there. Last couple three years, you guys have made a concerted effort to invest more in these growth initiatives. Is there more that you can do there, are you constrained by manpower, are you constrained by manufacturing capability, given that you're going to have higher growth here, you're going to generate more cash, are you looking at making more investments to try and drive these growth rates higher? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: You know, Nathan, part of what you saw in the engineering expenses for the year, that was actually a little bit above our expectation as the year has gone on and we performed better than our earlier expectations. We have put \u2013 we put even more money there. I don't see huge constraints in the intermediate-term. In the short term, you may have some constraints around people and engineering, just capacity. And so we're starting to alleviate some of that. But I think we've really taken the point of view consistently that we're going to fully fund. And so it's not something we really \u2013 we've backed off on. So manufacturing constraints, I don't see that very much. Maybe some short-term around engineering that we're working to alleviate. And then I think supply chain, as we've talked about, really though, last quarter, we started talking about it, maybe even the quarter before. Supply chain, I think, will become, it will become the kind of bottleneck. It's something that we're all going to be able to get our arms around. And certainly in areas that we start growing over and above the 9% in order growth, we have seen some strains there. And we got to make sure that we stay ahead of that curve. William K. Grogan - IDEX Corp.: And Nathan, this is Bill. The only thing I'd add is, right. Obviously, we want to go very deep on a limited number of initiatives. I think we've seen the success based upon prioritizing the critical few. So there's a lot around our focus around a small number of initiatives versus expanding the funnel and putting our toe on a bunch of different pools. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Good point, very good point. Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Over the years, Andy, you've always said that it's easy to ramp your business up than it is to ramp it down? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yes. Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And you're in an area here now, which is increased organic growth outlook where you're going to have to ramp the business up a little bit. Are there any costs that you need to add back in that might depress incrementals a little bit in the short-term or anything like that? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yes. I mean, a little bit, Nathan, but I wouldn't expect us to be underneath that 35% target. I can't see why that would be the case. So if you constrain \u2013 I said this many times, if you constrain your spending, and you get a quick ramp up, then, obviously, the incrementals can be big. I think we have enough visibility, and we are targeting enough areas that we should see incrementals to be healthy, north of that 35% range. But I don't want to hamper our spending to get five more points of incremental in the quarter when we're really kind of thinking about the long-term here. Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: You've said the incrementals go higher as the organic revenue growth goes higher. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yes. Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Now that we're getting into that 6% range, is there the potential for us to start pushing towards the number that's starts with a 4? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: It's possible, again, Nathan, I'm not \u2013 if I've got to make trade-offs, right, which I'm making sure that we're continuing to reach investment, to maximize our investment around very, very high return projects, we're delivering a 45% incremental, I'll trade of the investments, right, because I'll take that very attractive 35% with promise for greater long-term growth than a short term 40% or 45%. Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Fair enough. That's helpful. Thanks very much. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: You bet, Nathan. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran from Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Good morning, Mike. Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: So, last few quarters, you've kind of grown increasingly positive or at least increasingly constructive on the environment, but there's always been that cautionary note, uncertainty in the forward look. This quarter seems like other than maybe a comment on the political landscape here, not much uncertainty tingeing your comments. So some thoughts on sustainability as you see it going forward from here, obviously, a lot of momentum in the short-term... Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yeah. Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: ...but you clearly pulled your commentary more positive. So, some thoughts going from here? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yeah. So if you remember last quarter, my hesitancy was really around two things. One was, what I'll call the geopolitical risks that are out there; and the second was really around that we had not started to see sustained investments in larger things. Those are the two things that kind of gave me caution. I would put the geopolitical silliness at the exact same level than before. I don't think it's gotten better and I don't think it's gotten particularly worse. What I would say is, we are starting to see some more structural investment by industrially, not necessarily via governments, but we are starting to see some of that. And so that gives me some more confidence. And we're starting to see some of the businesses that had lagged bottom. I think the midstream energy is a good example of that. And so I do \u2013 I feel better that the balance of this year and probably into early 2018, there's more visibility than I think we had six months ago. Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: And what was the cadence like through the quarter? Pretty consistent or did you see a ramp that was different from seasonality? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: It was the normal ramp that we would see, Mike, but it wasn't a big hockey stick, which is good, right? Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: And so it was \u2013 if you actually went through, it was the orders were $183 million, $196 million, $207 million. That's how they went April, May, June. And sales were $174 million, $189 million, $210 million. And so that's a very normal pattern for us. And so that's a pretty good sign. If it was $150 million then $250 million at either ends of the barbell, you might be a little more worried. But that was a good pattern. Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: That makes sense. Last one then, just how do you view the actionability of your acquisition pipeline right now? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: It's good question, Mike. We've got more in the pipeline and there's more things further down than we've had in a little while. The thing that gives me pause is a number of things we've seen. We've seen prices really run at the last minute. And you just know how we feel about that. And so this is more stuff further down than we were talking here 90 days ago, but I think there's still a lot of volatility in getting things over the line just because of the nature of the marketplace. Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Makes sense. Appreciate the time. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: You bet, Mike. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Jeffrey Reive - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi, good morning. This is Jeff on for Deane. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Good morning. Jeffrey Reive - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Can you touch on the dispensing order that was delayed? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yeah. Jeffrey Reive - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Could you possibly size that, and do you expect to see that come in the third quarter or the fourth quarter? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yes, we talked about it in the last quarter. It's in the $5 million range, plus or minus. So it's certainly meaningful to the overall dispensing business and meaningful to the FSD segment. Obviously, it's less meaningful to the company as a whole. But we expected that. We're 90 days behind where we thought would be, to be honest with you, and we're hoping that will \u2013 there's no reason we believe it won't happen. But this is where we've got to work with our customers for what's best for them in terms of their own timing. So there's no reason to believe the order won't happen, and it won't turn into sales, but the timing is delayed. Jeffrey Reive - RBC Capital Markets LLC : All right. And then maybe when you guys look at your forward-looking indicators, what are you most optimistic about going forward for the second half of the year and into 2018? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yes. I'll say three things. One is the broad-based nature, right? So, because if you look at our portfolio, we are so diversified and we touch so many end markets that when you see it as broad-based at this, that's a good sign, right? It's a good sign of a healthy and improving economy; that's number one. Number two, we can very clearly pick out where we are driving incremental revenue, and where we're seeing the wins coming from, discrete actions that have been in place for a long period of time. So for me, that's very important. And then the final one is the work that we've done around segmenting our businesses and really understanding how and where we're going to compete. It makes me believe, and actually know, that the revenue that we're looking at is high-quality revenue. It's high return, high-margin, high return revenue. And I think it's a good overall story for IDEX within what I'll call an improving environment. Jeffrey Reive - RBC Capital Markets LLC : All right. Thank you. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey, good morning, all. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Good morning, Scott. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Very nice work. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Thank you. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): So the two questions I have, the first is on pricing. Would you kind of size that for us, Andy, and maybe also indicate which businesses were sort of above that or below that kind of thing? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yes, Scott, the story is really not different than what's been. We're still between 0.5 and 1 point in price across our businesses. The FMT businesses have done \u2013 typically get more price. HST, we've got larger customer concentration, a lot of multi-year contracts. And so we tend not to get as much price, so it will be negligible. It'll be positive, but negligible. And then FSD is kind of in the middle. So that pattern really hasn't changed. There's nothing materially different. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Got you. And then the other question is on sort of the fixed businesses, and I know that number we've thrown around at about 25% in sales. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yes. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I'm just kind of wondering where the margins are in some of those individual businesses to where you think that there might be a sales funding opportunity perhaps later this year, 2018, and which businesses would those be? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: You mean to sell the businesses? R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): No, no. You were \u2013 it doesn't sound like you're going to sell much more. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: No, no. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): So we're going to move into funding of those businesses? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Ohh. I'm sorry, I got it. I apologize I didn't understand that. So look, we've made great progress. We look at this monthly in terms of the discrete actions of improving profitability, and we are at/or ahead of plan in terms of our profit improvement for those businesses. As you know, we graduated a bunch of businesses last year into \u2013 out of that bucket and into one or the other growth buckets. And I expect we'll do that, again, this year. So we're making a lot of progress. To answer your question, look, we're on/or ahead of schedule in terms of margin improvement in those, and we expect to graduate some and move them into growth category or the outperformed category. As you know, we've kind of said, look, you only get two years in that bucket. So Bill, anything you would add there? William K. Grogan - IDEX Corp.: Yes, just a reminder, about a third of that bucket is our new acquisitions, right? So we continue to deal, you always see that fixed bucket as a certain percentage of our businesses and the two Fire assets that we bought last year are both on track, that 500 basis points. So about year and a half in on Akron and about a year in on AWG, and those are progressing nicely. And SFC is really more about growth story. We're implementing the operating model. Just to capture a few efficiencies on their side. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Absolutely. William K. Grogan - IDEX Corp.: So we'll probably see those three graduate here at the end of the year. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yes, yes. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): And if we were to look at, let's say, first quarter of next year, what would that percent of fixed would be down to? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: I'd need to look at that. William K. Grogan - IDEX Corp.: And plus it's going to vary depending on how many deals we can potentially close this year. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: If you \u2013 Scott, don't hold me to this, but if you neutralized for no more acquisitions, let's just say you didn't add it, you're probably somewhere \u2013 it goes into the 15% to 20% range. So call it 10 points or so of that bucket move out into one of the other buckets. So we're making the progress we had hoped to make. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Very good. Thank you. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Thank you, Scott. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey from Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hi. Good morning, all. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Good morning. Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hey, just wanted to come back to Akron Brass and the AWG. I mean it sounds like you're making good margin progression on those businesses. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yes. Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC : But if you are just to isolate those two assets, how did or how has the organic growth profile been over the front half of the year? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: It's actually been really good. It's exceeded our expectations compared to what we went to with the model. So now it's a little bit hard to discretely pick out the organic growth because we have started to put together the sales channels, and you are starting to put the businesses together. So as we go forward, it will get more difficult to pick out exactly what's the difference between Fire \u2013 our legacy fire and Akron-AWG because they're going to be coming together. So probably by the end of this year, we actually won't talk discreetly about those. But there are at/or above our expectations. Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay, great. And then Andy, maybe just speaking to the M&A question a little bit different. I mean, in terms of the funnel, and as you look at the strategic pillars between private equity to the carve-outs, the internally cultivated, how does the funnel compare and contrast between those particular areas, and where do you see the most opportunity? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: So the most volatility \u2013 but when you look at over time, right, and you say how much do one of those pillars change in terms of going into the funnel, the work that we do with private companies remains really steady, right? That doesn't change very much regardless of the environment. And the reason for that is typically the impetus for selling is a family event rather than an economic event. And so, you see less volatility there. So what we see, specifically, in our funnel now is you're seeing more private equity. That's the biggest change, meaning private equity folks coming to market. And selectively more corporates looking at some small divestitures. Those would be the two biggest things that have changed over time, and those are more driven by market conditions, right? So improvement in their overall businesses and strength in the seller's environment. Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay, great. And then just one little cleanup here. What was the size of the contingent consideration? I know these aren't abnormal... William K. Grogan - IDEX Corp.: It was $1 million. Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC : It was $1 million. William K. Grogan - IDEX Corp.: Yeah, yeah. Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Is that in the corporate books or the segment level? William K. Grogan - IDEX Corp.: No, that was last year, the contingent consideration. Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. I see. So you're... William K. Grogan - IDEX Corp.: Yeah. Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC : You're calling out the comp. Okay. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC : That's all for me. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville from Alembic Global Advisors. Please proceed with your question. Matt J. Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Thanks. A couple questions. First on FMT, when you look at, kind of, the absolute revenue level in the second quarter of this year versus last, pretty similar operating profit power, about $6 million, which, margins up very nicely as well. Can you sort of talk about what that step function improvement is being driven by? Is it a combination \u2013 obviously you have higher volume? Were the divestitures really not making money so you have accretion there? I guess, I'm trying to get a sense for is this a new baseline? We've had four quarters in a row, who will say average 27%. Is this a new baseline for that segment? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yes, it is. I think the 27% is a good new baseline. You've got a few things that have happened in there that have driven it. And it's a nice combination. So the divestitures were lower margin, overall. So that certainly did help to some degree. But it was small. The big things you have is you've got the impact of the fix businesses, and you've got the rebound in Warren Rupp, Viking and Banjo that are all very nice businesses in terms of their profit profile and contribution. So you put those three things together, and that's the difference. Matt J. Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : And then, with respect to the HST business, you mentioned a couple times in your prepared remarks how the industry is going through, sort of, a new product cycle, if you will. Can you \u2013 is there a way to describe how significant that is to IDEX over what timeframe you see this kind of ramping up, and then at some point I would imagine there's sort of a leveling off. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yeah. Matt J. Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : How we should expect that to manifest itself? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yeah, the way I would characterize it, you're talking about plus or minus about 15% of our business, right, that's kind of square in that area, that's looking against that new product cycle. I think it's pretty \u2013 from our visibility, it's pretty healthy year 2017, 2018 and even into 2019, assuming commercial success, right? We're assuming that our customers are going to have commercial success, and if you assume that, you can see some pretty good picture for us. Not at this kind of rates, right? So double digit organic growth in that area, that's too high. That was an anomaly in those businesses, but we do expect to see north of mid-single-digit organic growth on a compounded basis here for a little while. So that's kind of the impact. The driver of that is, you've got a lot happening in each of those worlds, whether it's the impact of mass spec on analytical instrumentation, the impact of the amount of testing and the exactness of testing in In Vitro Diagnostics and Bio and certainly, DNA sequencing. Those all have good trends compared to say maybe the last three or four years, where that was a little more soft. So hopefully that will dimensionalize it for you. Matt J. Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yeah. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Charley Brady with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question. Patrick Wu - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi, guys. This is actually Patrick Wu standing in for Charley. Thanks for taking my question. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Hi, Patrick. Patrick Wu - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Just I wanted to visit the margin profiles a little bit, each of the segments. Obviously, you guys laid out sort of the ranges, I think a couple of quarters ago. With organic growth sort of improving, I don't know if it's to the expectations that you guys have also orders \u2013 organic orders up 9% this quarter. Is it time you guys think that want to revisit the targets and things like that? Is there a room for maybe on the higher end of that to exit the year or maybe even be sort of, I guess, above that range? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: I don't think so. I think what we've laid out is very consistent, right? We've kind of said, FMT, we're talking somewhere in that 27% range; HST is 23%, and FSD 25%, plus or minus. I think our expectations through the year \u2013 they capture what we believe will be the flow-through that allows us to invest at the rate we want to and still get incremental margin expansion at a healthy rate. I don't think there's \u2013 I don't believe there's a big upside here that you guys and we haven't captured to any degree. Patrick Wu - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay, that's fair. And obviously, I think you touched upon a little bit in the last question. With a lot of focus on organic investments even throughout the downturn, what percentage of your sales are from new product developed over the last 12 to 18 months now? And sort of where do you guys see that number going, let's say in 2018? William K. Grogan - IDEX Corp.: Yeah, so, Patrick, we actually spend very little time looking at that. And I've actually pushed really hard to eliminate what a lot of people call vitality index. And the reason I do is that our business actually thrives because we have very long product life cycles and the defensibility of that is really tremendous. And so I think in the nature of our business, when you put in targets like that, what happens is people start to chase an artificial metric versus thinking about the long term and building the business. And so if you just kind of think of the equation for winning for IDEX, if we outpace our underlying markets by north of 200 basis points on an ongoing basis, the compounding effect of that, the impact of earnings and margins and return on capital is just outstanding. And so our focus is how do we invest to beat our markets by a couple hundred basis points a year. And if we do that consistently, we got a winner. Patrick Wu - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got it. And just one final housekeeping one. Maybe I have missed it earlier, but the dispensing order that got pushed out, was that captured in the order growth for the segment this quarter? Or was that not in there yet? William K. Grogan - IDEX Corp.: No, that was not. Patrick Wu - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. William K. Grogan - IDEX Corp.: Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Good morning. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Hey, Joe. William K. Grogan - IDEX Corp.: Good morning. Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Just wanted to catch up maybe on China a little bit. A lot of headlines about the housing sector there and maybe some curves trying to go into restraint pricing and investment. How do you view the level of activity there? How sustainable do you think it is? And how are you guys trying to position yourselves ahead of maybe some government regulations that might be going in over there? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yes, so China generally has improved for us. We'd had a couple of soft years in China. And overall, it's actually done a little bit better. In terms of major regulations that are going to impact it, there's nothing that we see there's going to be a major driver. And remember, when all said and done, we're talking about 5% to 6% of sales. So I don't think it's going to be a huge driver to overall success, but I don't see a major inflection point. Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Anything specifically on some of your, like, Fire businesses or anything like that on the municipal side over there? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yes, yes. So we've actually had real success here this year, specifically in our Rescue business. As you know, the Rescue business had been soft for really two years. And this year, we've seen some significant improvement. We are actually launching a series of new products for the Fire business out of our Dinglee business, and we think those will be quite successful. But I think we're still early days. Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks, guys. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: You bet. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brett Kearney from Gabelli. Please proceed with your question. Brett Kearney - GAMCO Investors, Inc.: Hi, guys. Good morning. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Good morning. Brett Kearney - GAMCO Investors, Inc.: Thanks for taking my call. Just want to ask at a high level how you guys are thinking about your capital allocation priority in this current environment, I guess, given the robust acquisition pipeline you mentioned, kind of balanced against the new product opportunities that you guys have right now. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yes, one of the things that I feel very passionate about, and also very fortunate, is we're not capital constrained when it comes to growth investments, organic growth investments. We do not hold back, we fully fund our organic growth investments, fortunate to have the kind of free cash flow. So through thick and thin, we're going to maximize that and push as hard as we can to drive new market development, new product development, et cetera. And so that's going to be priority one, and it's always going to be priority one in our business because the returns on capital are outstanding and the defensibility of those cash flows long term are outstanding. Secondly, we want you guys to have a consistent view of what dividends are going to be, so kind of 30%, 35% of net income. And then it really comes down to M&A and share repurchase. And so our first priority after those things is going to be, hey, how do we put money to work strategically around building our platforms of businesses that are going to have the same kind of characteristics that we have today. And then, if the market presents the opportunity, to buy back our shares and drive shareholder value in a differentiated way, we'll do so. So we pivot back and forth there. But with all that, patience, to me, is absolutely critical. And so when you're in a marketplace of very high valuations and what I think is oftentimes irrationality around pricing, being patient, being willing to build cash for a period of time and then taking advantage of opportunities when they present themselves aggressively, I think, is the way to do it. So there'll be times when we'll build cash, when it's prudent to do and there'll be times when we get really aggressive, and we deploy capital towards acquisitions or share repurchase when it makes sense. Brett Kearney - GAMCO Investors, Inc.: Great. Thanks very much, Andy. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bhupender Bohra with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC : Hey, good morning, guys. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Good morning, Bhupender. Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC : My question is around HST. Now, I believe that business, about 30% to 40% of the business is kind of industrial focused here. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yes. Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC : Could you give us some color on the \u2013 I mean, the orders have been pretty nice and strong for this quarter, like 11% and if you can give us some color on the industrial part of the business, how MPT and some of the sealing platform businesses are doing? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yes. So if you kind look at, if i were going to rack and stack the orders in the second quarter, kind of who did what in that world, the life sciences group was \u2013 well, actually Sealing and Life Sciences are kind of neck and neck both in the double-digit territory, and we had a pretty tough comp around MPT, but also remember, we told you when we did that facility consolidation with our Materials Process, there was a good chunk of business, around $10 million a year that we're going to walk from. And we saw that here in the quarter as we expected it. And then the industrial stuff is kind of in the middle, right, in the middle between those two things but generally pretty good across the board and certainly, at/or above our expectations. Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC : And how was the cadence of the orders like? If you can just talk about HST, and maybe the FMT and FSD through the quarter and if you're seeing any different like in July we are \u2013 like three weeks in July right now, so... Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yes, nothing different from what I answered before. I'm not sure if you heard when I think Mike asked the question earlier. So we saw an order pattern that was what you'd expect throughout the quarter and nothing surprising. No big hockey stick, which is good, and July, generally, is at our expectation, Bill, nothing really surprising, right? William K. Grogan - IDEX Corp.: No. Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC : Okay, got it. Thanks a lot. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jim Giannakouros with Oppenheimer & Co. Please proceed with your question. Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Hi, Jim. William K. Grogan - IDEX Corp.: Hi Jim. Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Sorry, I hopped on a little late here so sorry if you've covered it, so I fully understand you're seeing broad-based strength across your portfolio and, obviously, that's a nice anchor to your, I guess, your confidence in just your organic progression going forward. But how would you rank order major end markets by your confidence level in, I guess, sustainable growth, appreciating we're in very different innings of different cycles, whether it be Water, Muni, Ag, General, Industrial or Gas, etcetera? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yes, well, I guess, you want to talk sustainability and level, right? Because those two things could be different. So as an example, I think that if you look at Muni, I think the sustainability is going to be pretty good, right, but it's going to be at lower levels. I think the life sciences based businesses; they probably have the longest lights that we can see here a little bit. Our Sealing business is really well-positioned. If you look at how they are winning, yes, some of their markets are improving but they are winning some really nice chunks of market share that should be sustainable going out. And then you got some things that are more cyclically driven, although we are doing our own. So if you look at what's going on with Banjo, Warren Rupp, those are more cyclically driven. What's happening to Viking is cyclical, but also we're winning some big chunks of business from discrete actions. So, there is a little bit \u2013 then the energy stuff is \u2013 we're really kind of at this \u2013 at cyclical point where I think we get some improvement in the midstream. That's how I break it down. Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: You bet. Operator : There are no further questions in queue. I'd like to hand the call back over to management for closing comments. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Well, thank you all very much. As we come to a close of this call, obviously, we've had some strength specifically in our order book and, I think, good results. And just acknowledging the team here throughout IDEX, and our 7000-plus associates have done a great job of really grabbing onto a differentiated way of running this business, which is thinking about deep segmentation, making focused investments to grow the business and then real rigor around capital deployment, all kind of within the values that we've laid out here at IDEX and how we execute with our operating model. I just want to thank them for a great job, and I think positioning ourselves for success in the long-term. And also thank you to each of you, the analysts and our investors; I appreciate your time and attention to the company and understanding the company and your support. And we look forward to talking to here in 90 days. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Andy Silvernail. Andy Silvernail : Hey, thanks Mike. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us here to discuss our third quarter results. Overall I\u2019m very pleased with the results and how our year is shaping up. We\u2019ve now experienced three straight quarters of strong order, sales and earnings and we\u2019re expecting this trend to continue in the fourth quarter, which will lead to a record for the year for the company. Organic growth in both orders and sales are a direct result of our ability to capitalize on the strengthening economy and our ability to execute on our growth initiatives. Our effort segment in our portfolio continued to pay dividends and drive exceptional results for IDEX. We\u2019re experiencing broad based strength within a majority of our end markets including Life Science, Semicon, Water, Ag and Industrial. Over the last few quarters we\u2019re had pockets of concerns in the portfolio, specifically around mid-stream energy and dispensing and I\u2019ll tell you that both are showing nice signs of improvement and I\u2019ll talk about that a little bit later on.  As always I\u2019ll walk through some of the specific details in regards to the markets and the segments shortly, but overall I am very pleased with how the company is performing. Our operating results to-date have been outstanding and above expectations and I expect this to continue for the rest of the year. Orders remain strong across all three segments, delivering third quarter overall growth of 8%, up 7% organically. FSD was up 10% and FMT and HST were each up 6%. Revenue grew 8% overall, 7% organically as well, driven by strength in all three segments. HST was up 10%, FMT was up 7%, FST was up 4%. We saw a nice ratable increase in both orders and sales throughout the quarter. It looked very much like we have in the last two quarters.  The team once again delivered very solid results. Gross margins were 44.9% that was up 140 basis points. Adjusting for the inventory step up from last year gross margin was up 50 basis points. We\u2019re pleased with the expansion, at the same time we are still having some inefficiencies that we mentioned last quarter and we expect those to be completed by the end of the year.  We had Op margin of 22%, that was up 130 basis points compared to prior year and I want to take a minute and talk about this in a little bit of detail. I know there are some questions here on flow-through, probably one of the bigger questions of the day, and let me start by saying our operating flow-through was very strong. If you look at the 130 basis points improvement and then the 10 basis points compared to prior year, we had almost $6 million of variable comp expense that hit us in the quarter.  We had our CFO depart last year, which was a positive to last year but created a headwind for this year and we had our strong performances turned into strong variable comps. So again, on an apples-to-apples basis, our flow-through was just over 36% and our margin expansion is at 110 basis points on the operating line. EPS of a $1.08 was up $0.16 or 17% compared to last year; it was a record for the quarter. Free cash flow was $115 million at 138% conversion which obviously is a very strong quarter.  Now let me take a minute and talk about what we\u2019re seeing in our core markets and geographies. In agriculture we continue to see improvement in this market and we\u2019re going to finish strong with 2017 and it\u2019s going to bode well for 2018. We\u2019re seeing strength in both OEM and distribution. Municipal end markets in both water and fire continue to see positive momentum. Our mid-stream oil and gas business is starting to see signs of recovery. As you know we talked about that and we believe we start to see that at the end of the year and we are, and upstream continues to do well. In our Scientific Fluidics and Optics business, the markets remain one of our best performers and we\u2019re seeing strength in IVD Bio, analytical instrumentation and DNA sequencing; all of these continue to outperform. Semicon demand remains strong and we expect it to continue through the balance of the year and into next year, really driven by new products and new market entry of our teams, and in industrial we continue to see tailwinds from the industrial rebound across our businesses. If you look at the regions, North America is leading the rebound in the global recovery and we expect that to continue going forward. Europe also has had some real strength. We do have some tailwinds from FX, but across the board in Europe we\u2019re seeing improvement in auto and in housing and these really bode well for our continued expansion in Europe. In Asia, we\u2019re getting volume increases. We had some large project orders that have come through here in the year, but we\u2019re also seeing strong distribution performance in China, which is a nice sign. If we turn now to capital deployment, we\u2019re committed to the strategy that we\u2019ve laid out for some years now and the results have really proved out the strategy, and I want to take a few minutes to walk through each element of that strategy. In terms of organic growth, I\u2019m obviously very pleased with our performance, 6% organic growth and 5% organic sales growth for the year is outstanding, so year-to-date really great results.  7% organic growth in the quarter is our strongest since the third quarter of 2014 and we\u2019ve been very consistent that organic investments are going to be our number one priority. We believe that our business segmentation coupled with funding those best organic initiatives is leading to a very strong performance. The 7% organic orders growth achieved in the quarter is about \u2013 or sales growth rather is about half market and about half our initiatives and we are very pleased with those results. We\u2019re trying to build a culture of growth here at the company and we are very excited about the journey that we\u2019re on. In terms of dividends the practice that we\u2019ve laid out for the last few years remains consistent. On September 14 our Directors approved our 92th consecutive dividend, which is $0.37 a share. In the quarter we bought back about $14 million worth of shares, 116,000 shares of our stock. Year-to-date we bought back about 200,000 at a cost of about $24 million and although we\u2019re not purchasing as many shares as we had in the past few years, we remain very committed to the strategy and we\u2019ll continue to deploy capital as it makes sense and we drive shareholder value with our share repurchases. In terms of M&A, it\u2019s our number one priority inorganically and we\u2019ll continue to drive the strategy. Our funnel is solid. We\u2019re working on various opportunities. But with that said, you know look, we all know, valuations are high and we\u2019re going to be incredibly disciplined with how we deploy capital to drive value for shareholders. Our balance sheet is in great shape and we have great free cash flow. At the end of the month we had net leverage is about one times and we had growth leverage at about 1.5 times, so we have a great abundance of capital to deploy for our strategies. Let me transition now. I\u2019m on slide five and I\u2019m going to talk about the third quarter results. Q3 revenue of $574 million was a third quarter record. It was up 8% overall, 7% organically. It was driven by growth within all three segments; HST up 10%, FMT up 7% and FST up 4%. I\u2019d like to point out that we didn\u2019t burn any backlog in the quarter as orders were also $574 million. Operating margin as I said was 22% up 130 basis points and again on an apples-to-apples basis up 110 basis points. I\u2019d like to provide some details relative to our Q3 effective tax rate also. In 2017 in the quarter we had a 26.4% tax rate compared to 29.6% in 2016. This is 320 basis points less than last year and was really associated with our reparation of cash from China that was used for our SFC acquisition. This drop in the rate was expected and the reason we guided a 26.5% ETR three months ago. Q3 had income of $84 million, resulted in an EPS of $1.08. This is a record for the third quarter. It was up $0.16 or 17% from the adjusted prior period. Free cash flow for the quarter was strong at $115 million, again converted to 138%. Alright, let\u2019s turn to slide six. We\u2019ll now walk into the segment discussions. I\u2019m going to start with Fluid & Metering. For the third quarter in a row, FMC was solid. We had organic order and sales growth of 6% and 7% respectively. Op margin was up 130 basis points primarily due to higher volume, cost savings from prior year and our restructuring activities. In water we\u2019re experiencing strong demand in the US distribution for our new products and the municipal markets continue to grow. We\u2019ve also had terrific new product development, this is come out in this area and we\u2019re getting some project wins in Asia. In industrial fluids, our pump business had another great quarter. We had double digit increases in orders and sales. US distributors are optimistic about the rest of 2017 and we continue to have some wind at our back caused by the oil and gas businesses across the US and Europe and really globally. Valve business continues to be strong. We\u2019ve had a nice increase in sales and orders and we\u2019re seeing stability in the large chemical customers around the world. Our midstream energy business as I mentioned has been improving. We\u2019ve been keeping an eye on that here really for the balance of the year. We\u2019ve seen that improving. Specifically we\u2019re seeing truck build for LPG increase, which bodes well for 2018. The LPG mobile market in Europe has also improved and we\u2019re seeing share gains by some of our larger customers. Overall there still remain challenges in this piece of our business, but we are seeing a recovery and again this positions us well looking at next year. Ag has been a great story this year. We\u2019ve got consecutive quarters of double digit order and sales increase and optimism continues as we look at 2018, really as we see the pre-build season upon us and we\u2019re seeing strength in both OEMs and distributors. Alright, let\u2019s turn to slide seven and we\u2019ll talk about Health & Science. Similar to FMT, HST has experienced three strong quarters in a row with organic orders up 6% and organic sales up 10% over the last year. Operating margin increased 190 basis points for the third quarter, mainly due to higher volume and inclusion of the fair value inventory step up from last year. Although I\u2019m happy with 190 basis point increase for the quarter, we have had some inefficiencies that were seen mostly within HST that we feel very confident will be done by the end of the year. In Scientific Fluidics and Optics, AI, Bio IVD and DNA sequencing are all seeing strong demand and we expect that to continue. Our optics businesses are now fully integrated with our life science and our fluidics business and we\u2019re seeing our thesis come to life here, specifically the combination of optic solutions and fluid solutions driving significant competitive advantage for us.  We also announced in the third quarter our decision to build an optical center of excellence in Rochester New York. By the end of 2018 we\u2019ll consolidate three of our optics businesses into one state of the art facility that will be a huge win for our customers and for our people. We continue to make long term investments in this market and will bear fruit down the road. In sealing solutions it was really a phenomenal quarter, double digit organic order and revenue growth primarily driven by strength in the semicon market and we\u2019re seeing SFC nicely integrate into our sealing platform and delivering on the promises of that acquisition. HST industrial results are strong, particularly in the US, UK and some new business wins in China. MPT, we had some large orders in the quarter and our pipeline for future orders looks good. We did \u2013 we haven\u2019t finalized our site consolidation and we think as we get into 2018 the benefits of that site consolidation to be fully in play. Okay, I\u2019m on our last segment, slide eight for diversified. Organic orders were up 10% in the quarter and organic sales increased 4%. Operating margin was up 130 basis points in the third quarter, primarily due to volume and the inclusion of fair value inventory step up from last year.  Dispensing, you know we\u2019ve talked a little bit about plateauing here in the last few quarters, but in the third quarter we secured three nice sized dispensing orders. We have order strength across the globe and nice order for X-SMART in emerging markets and two relatively large DIY orders in North America, including the order that we\u2019ve been talking about here that\u2019s been pushed a couple of quarters. So this has really been the big factor driving the 10% order growth in FST. Additionally we are launching some new products in dispensing in Europe that I think are going to position us well for 2018. In Fire & Safety the North American markets remain solid with both fire and rescue. The muni markets are outperforming expectations and the rescue business in particular in North America has been exceptionally strong. Our eDRAULIC tools continue to capture share. We are gaining the synergy that we expected from the integration of Akron and AWG. I\u2019m excited by the potential that these give us going forward. They are absolutely meeting our expectations. And then finally BAND-IT had a strong quarter; high single digit revenue growth in the quarter. We\u2019re seeing nice share wins in auto, a rebound in energy as well as an uptick in industrial. Okay, I\u2019m on our last slide, slide nine. Let\u2019s talk about the fourth quarter and full year 2017 guidance. For the fourth quarter we estimate EPS in $1.06 to $1.08. Organic revenue growth at about 6%, operating margins at about 22%, the tax rate should be about 28%, FX will provide about a 3% tailwind and corporate costs should be about $17 million. For the year, as we look at our outlook, we look at the solid results we\u2019ve had to-date, obviously a very strong third quarter. We're going to raise our EPS guidance. We\u2019re now going to be $4.25 to $4.27, which will be a record for IDEX. We continue to expect full year organic revenue growth to be a little over 5%, the full year operating margin at about 22%, FX will be a headwind of a little less than 1% for the full year. Our corporate costs should be around $70 million and our free cash flow should be 120% of net income. As always, none of these forward-looking statements include the impact of acquisitions or potential restructuring. And with that, let me pause here and Doug, I\u2019ll turn it over to you for questions from those on the phones. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Mike Halloran : Good morning, everyone. Andy Silvernai : Good morning, Mike. Mike Halloran : So, you know Andy if I think over the last few quarters here, you know particularly starting last year, numerous headwinds from a growth perspective and each quarter it seems like you\u2019re picking a few of those off and negative markets are starting to turn more positive or at least flattening and now you\u2019re listening to the dialogue here and not sure I heard any markets where you were sounding overly concerned, right. Even some of the midstream markets which have lagged from a recovery perspective are starting to turn a little bit. So maybe comment broadly on if there are any markets out there that you\u2019re looking at that you\u2019re concerned about and if anything changes you would look to the quarter on that side. Andy Silvernai : Mike, you\u2019ve definitely hit it on the head here. You know the two of it that have been lingering are really mid-stream energy and dispensing. I would say from a mid-stream energy, we are definitely starting to see that alleviate, the entire market alleviate, which is obviously positive as we head into the fourth quarter and into next year, so I think that\u2019s good news. Dispensing, I would say the market trends haven\u2019t changed from what we\u2019ve talked about. The wins in the quarter and what I think will be wins next year are really driven by our actions. You know the wins at the two [DIY] [ph] that I talked about, those are things that we\u2019ve been working on for an awful long time. You know we work on it constantly really and you know the large X-SMART order that we got are things that we\u2019ve been you know working in our sales funnel for a long time.  But I don\u2019t think the markets have changed. I think those will still be relatively flat as we think about you know the fourth quarter and going into next year. But broadly Mike, you\u2019re right; things have continued to firm as I think through how this year has progressed and what I think is going to \u2013 2015 is going to turn into unless we have some you know exogenous event. I think we\u2019ll continue to see a firming of markets and some improvements, some momentum. Mike Halloran : So then let\u2019s translate that into early thoughts on next year and more focused on momentum and then timing of the capital side. Andy Silvernai : Yeah. Mike Halloran : So obviously a lot of shot cycle momentum that we\u2019ve seen here. On the capital side it\u2019s more a dispensing side and things that have been healthy for a while, just maybe plateauing at a nice level. Maybe talk about the short cycle progression as you work into next year and then more importantly has your thought process on timing of larger CapEx from an industry perspective changed at all? Is that getting pulled forward or is it still pretty similar? Andy Silvernai : I don\u2019t think it\u2019s changed very much. I think that as we move through this quarter, some larger capital spend, if you see good numbers I think you\u2019ll start to see some improvement in large capital spend. But I think what\u2019s going to play out here now are two things; number one, you know we\u2019re seeing what I\u2019ll call \u2013 you know they are definitely projects, but they are small projects. We\u2019ve definitely seen improvement of that throughout this year.  I do think you\u2019re going to start to see some larger stuff come into play as we get into \u201915, as people are planning now for \u201915, I think you\u2019ll start to see \u2013 sorry, for \u201918, \u201915, God! I\u2019m losing it. In \u201818 I think you\u2019ll start to see some of those come into play. To be clear, we haven\u2019t seen those in our work yet and so this is a belief of mine, but I think you will start to see that into \u201818 and importantly, distribution improving. The momentum in distribution is a good sign and we are seeing that across our portfolio. So you pick the business, distribution is getting better, which typically is a good overall indicator. Mike Halloran : One follow-up on that last point. Where \u2013 no, the second last point there. Where would you most see in your portfolio, the larger CapEx items start coming through? Andy Silvernai : Well, you see them in a couple of places right. So FMT would be the biggest place you would see it. But then you also see it a little bit in Fire & Rescue, right. So the governments will release funds and you will start to see it in Rescue a little bit, but FMT mostly is where you would see that pop-up and also in MPT a little bit, right. You see some of the larger pharma projects in MPT. Mike Halloran : It makes sense. Thanks Andy. I appreciate it. Andy Silvernai : You bet Mike. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Allison Poliniak : Hi guys, good morning. Andy Silvernai : Good morning Allison. Allison Poliniak : I just want to touch on the organic investment. Obviously you have seen a lot of success out of that. How are you thinking about organic investments not with you know obviously more comfort in the growth. Are we accelerating it here where it could hold back incrementals, you know not a bad thing. But you know how should we think about I guess that investment at this point in the cycle sale? Andy Silvernai : So let me answer your direct question, and then answer \u2013 I\u2019m going to be a politician and answer the question I want to answer, how about that? Allison Poliniak : Sounds good. Andy Silvernai : So one is no. We are investing fully. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to drag down our incrementals. You know we have talked a lot about that 35% range that we believe we can achieve that even investing at the right kind of rate. If we wanted to pull back, obviously we can get some more. But we are going to fully fund it, the kind of rates that we are at and so I feel good about that. So I have a lot of confidence that we\u2019ll continue to invest at the rates that we want to and need to and still provide attractive incrementals.  You know I think one of the important questions on this call is really around that margin profile and the fall through and I wanted to provide some clarity in my comments, but it\u2019s a really important one, right, which is when you dig into that you say hey, what\u2019s really happening at the operating level of the fall-through at IDEX. It\u2019s a really good story. It\u2019s between 35% and 40% for the quarter and you have some noise in there. You got the step-up, we sold a business last year, you got variable comp, there is a lot of pieces in there. But when you wash that through and you say what\u2019s happening operating-to-operating, it\u2019s a really good story. We are delivering exactly where we said we would at the levels of increased revenue. Allison Poliniak : No, that\u2019s great, that\u2019s helpful. And then the inefficiencies in HST, remind me, that\u2019s the site consolidation and is it just dragging a little further than what you would have thought I guess? Andy Silvernai : Well remember we said last question, we said it was about $3 million and we said we\u2019d get through about half of it, so we\u2019d be at a run-rate of about $1.5 million and then we\u2019d get rid of the rest of it as we get into the fourth quarter, and we actually experienced about $2 million versus $1.5 million, so it\u2019s about $0.5 million less than we through. Part of it is site consolidation at MPT and then part of it is frankly the rate of growth within Life Sciences, right.  So that\u2019s just been really strong and we\u2019ve got a couple of sites that have \u2013 that struggle to meet demand. We\u2019ve got our eyes on it. We know how to solve it. It just takes a little bit of time and we\u2019d rather eat a little bit here than disappoint our customers. And so even with that we are able to deliver on the kind of flow-through that we are talking about. So you now obviously we get some of the stuff cleaned up and the underlying earnings power is pretty good. Allison Poliniak : No, that\u2019s great and just one last one on the corporate cost line. It seemed to be a little higher this quarter and then obviously you raised the outlook for this year. I mean what\u2019s going on there? What should I think about that? Andy Silvernai : Yes Allison, that goes right back to the variable comp statement. Allison Poliniak : Got it. Andy Silvernai : So you got two things going on. One, you know last year our CFO moved on and we had some, you get some benefit from that, right. And then this year our variable comp, our bonus payments are going to be substantially higher because of the very strong performance that we\u2019ve had this year. So you put those two things together and it\u2019s not a small number right; literally it\u2019s $6 million in the quarter, those two things together. So that\u2019s why if you look at apples-to-apples and you say okay, lets wash this stuff out. If you take out that variable comp impact margins end up being up 110 basis points, op margins 110, and flow-through at north of 36%. Allison Poliniak : Great, thank you. Andy Silvernai : You bet, Allison, thanks. Operator : Out next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Adam Farley : Hey, this is Adam Farley on for Nathan. Andy Silvernai : Hey Adam, how are you? Adam Farley : Doing well, doing well. I thought you called out continued momentum and strength in agriculture, but the \u2013 oh yeah and the distribution. Could you just provide a little more color there, like what\u2019s driving that? Andy Silvernai : Well, you know we actually, we just finished our strat cycle and one of the things that we were really digging into is kind of the difference between you know kind of pharma earnings, pharma income right and cash income and those are two very different things right. And what you have seen happen here is you\u2019ve actually seen cash income accelerate ahead of pharma income and we are seeing people reinvest, so that\u2019s the principal driver.  And then you had two years that they were pretty tough, right. So you had this great run-up, you had two very tough years. So I think you are seeing a rebound generally from some latent activity that probably needed to happen, and you have an increase in cash income, and that\u2019s showing up at the OEMs and at the distributors. Adam Farley : All right, that\u2019s helpful. And then just turning to the muni markets, you said there was positive momentum there as well. What\u2019s driving that? Is that more government funds or a little more details? Andy Silvernai : Yeah, you are seeing more headcounts. You got \u2013 I\u2019m not sure if this is a good thing or not, the government is growing. So you are seeing continued spend and continued employment and so generally these aren\u2019t huge numbers, but they continue to be positive. Adam Farley : All right great, thank you. Andy Silvernai : Thanks Adam. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with Alembic Global Advisors. Please proceed with your question. Q \u2013 Matt Summerville : Thanks, good morning. A couple of questions; first, just on the consolidation activities, I thought you mentioned something \u2013 well, two actually pertaining to HST; one in Optics, three facilities getting combined into a new facility in Rochester and then the things that are ongoing I believe with respect to MPT. If you kind of net those two together what should we be looking at from a restructuring or a cost saving stand point in 2018 and then I have a follow-up? Andy Silvernai : Yes. So the MPT stuff is done, right. So we did that this year, you\u2019ve already seen the restructuring cost, those have already flowed through, so that\u2019s there in the first quarter. So now it\u2019s just kind of getting that fully up to speed. The optics center of excellence just to level set everybody, our two big life science Optics businesses are actually sitting in Rochester today. So they are in Rochester today and what we are going to do is we are going to build a new state-of-the-art facility that\u2019s going to give us the ability to expand and very importantly modernize a few things in a part of the business. So we will be able to really invest in there, and that\u2019s the bulk of it, and then we have some smaller things moving over from other facility, from a smaller facility. And so the total restructuring cost and bill for next year \u2013 for us this year, what do you think that will be? Bill Grogan : That\u2019s a couple of million bucks. Andy Silvernai : It\u2019s not big, it\u2019s not big Matt. it\u2019s a couple of million and the benefits of this are you will get a little bit cost savings, it\u2019s not a ton, but the benefits of this are really our ability to drive growth and productivity and modernize those facilities. These are the business where we are seeing Fluidics and Optics you know really come together, that strategy, that thesis we talked about for a long time. It allows us to expedite that and service the large OEMs that are out there that we have great partnerships with them. Q \u2013 Matt Summerville : And then just in terms of the M&A pipeline, can you speak to the actionability. You guys I think it\u2019s a been a little over a year since you have done a deal and maybe speak to whether or not you think multiples at this point are just completely prohibitive or whether you are perhaps a bit more optimistic looking forward? Thank you. Andy Silvernai : So let me answer that in two ways. One I\u2019ll just kind of talk about the funnel generally, which is again I\u2019m sounded like a broken record, but it looks a lot like it\u2019s going to historically look. There is nothing surprising in our funnel, either positively or negatively.  In terms of the stuff we are seeing right now, we are looking at some things right now that are absolutely actionable, there is no doubt and we are constantly in these discussions and we are in several discussion as we speak. The question becomes, can you get over the finish line and the biggest issue today of getting over the finish line is around valuation and so we have certainly seen valuations creep up, we\u2019ve certainly seen some very aggressive bidders in the market place and we are, we are disciplined.  We know where it makes sense for us and our shareholders and if we have to choose between building cash and doing bad expensive deal, we\u2019ll chose to build cash and eventually it will break our way. I think patience really pays off here with owning the kind of companies that are IDEX like companies, that you guys enjoy, that have real defensible models, our ability to drive incremental growth, our ability to expand margins and drive high returns on capital, and we are going to be patient. Q \u2013 Matt Summerville : Thanks Andy. Andy Silvernai : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Steven Winoker : Thanks. Good morning Andy, Bill. Andy Silvernai : Good morning. Good to hear your voice. Steven Winoker : It\u2019s good to be here. I wanted to just follow up on the last question that you talked about or maybe just make it a little broader. Andy, how has your thinking continued to evolve given you are now seeing 7% organic growth rate that you mentioned? How has your thinking evolved from the scope of the business that IDEX, you know this has been an ongoing thought process for a lot of years. Where are you in that thought process? Andy Silvernai : You mean in terms of our ability to drive organic growth Steve. Steven Winoker : Yes, I think relative to that scope and the question of simplification and across \u2013 and optimization across the portfolio. Andy Silvernai : You know I still think we have a long way to go Steve. You know we have come a long way, but it\u2019s almost like you kind of peal back that layer and you find something else that\u2019s interesting. And I think you know the early phases were eliminating a lot of waste, right, that was the first phase of eliminating a lot of waste, a lot of non-value added activity and getting people just focused, you know just on a handful on things.  The second phase was moving that more deeply into the customer, meaning that we were more present at the customer, more people, more spending and that\u2019s kind of the phase that we are in now and that\u2019s why you are hearing us talk so much more about new product development and it\u2019s not that we were bad at new product development in the past. We\u2019ve just \u2013 we\u2019ve reached a new level where I think we are closer to our customers and we are choosing where we want to play in a much more focused and intense way frankly, right. We are putting more people in resources on a smaller handful or areas.  The next phase that we are going to move into here is really around how do we accelerate the different points of connections across IDEX and we are seeing that \u2013 if you see the different areas that work for us; so if you look at our integrated growth, so IDEX Health & Science building the center of excellence, right. We are now getting a scale in a handful of areas in Optics that are going to allow us to merge our Optics and Fluidics in this really unique value proposition as an example, that\u2019s going to allow us to continue to growth that business faster.  What we did at MPT and bringing those businesses together, again we\u2019ve gone and we found scale in places that we didn\u2019t have scale before. So we now have more engineering resources to focus on really two markets, pharma and food, where we were all over the place before and we are able to double down on some of those things. So I think we are entering that phase now Steve, where we are finding more and frankly bigger opportunities because we are simply closer to the customer, the noise is lower and we are making some bigger bets. Steven Winoker : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just as a follow-up as you think about that model evolving, the sustainability of these incremental margins, particularly around pricing power and the wage inflation challenges that you are -- not the temporary one, but sort of the broader one. How can \u2013 what\u2019s your thinking in terms of convincing investors of the sustainability of that? Andy Silvernai : You know I think our pricing power, our pricing equation is excellent and I think it will be excellent over time. You know historically we\u2019ve done a really good job of getting half a point to a point of price, and then ultimately the delta, the difference between pricing and inflation, that\u2019s been a really, that\u2019s been a pretty constant number for us; that spread has been pretty constant.  You know one of the things that we have been experiencing in the last year is lower pricing and we are starting to see that inflation come up a bit and so we needed to make sure we stay ahead of that and we\u2019ve done a good job with that. That has come down a little bit. That delta, that spread has come down a little bit, but I actually think that we\u2019ll maintain our historical spread.  If anything, one of the things that this amount of segmentation does, and the amount of focus that we are talking about, it pushes you into businesses where you are likely to increase that spread, not decrease that spread. And so if I think long term, if I think three to five years from now, do I think we\u2019ll still get the spread? Yes, I do. Do I think the probability of it being higher versus lower is better? I do Steve, and a lot of it comes down to playing in markets where we have a definitive advantage; where the mode is wider, the mode is deeper and we frankly have more ability to command price, because we bring tremendous value to those customers. Steven Winoker : Okay, and then\u2026 Bill Grogan : And even in the businesses we\u2019ve seen inflation spike a little bit this year, we\u2019ve been able to go out in the third quarter proactively with incremental pricing to get ahead of it. So I think the businesses are well positioned to keep that spread as we move forward here over the next 12 to 24 months. Steven Winoker : Okay, great. And just one last one, are you seeing any signs of any of your OEs or others in the market attempting to back with vertical integrator experiment with places that you are historically strong? Andy Silvernai : You know that tends to happen when you get off the technology curve. The places, the only places where you really see that as a risk right, and we obviously think a lot about it and when you look at the Life Science world, that\u2019s a pretty consolidated world, and we are very mindful of that, and if you lose your technology development, then there would be a risk of that or if you start to play and say build the print sort of stuff, then you are in a difficult spot. But if you are working with them, you are building, you are consistently building your next level of technology you are in pretty good shape. Steven Winoker : Okay, great. Thanks. Andy Silvernai : Thanks Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Jeffrey Reive : Hi, this is Jeffrey on for Deane Dray. I was wondering if the mid stream oil recovery has been all price related or if there\u2019s been competitive dynamic changes? Andy Silvernai : No real competitive dynamic changes and I wouldn\u2019t say that you are starting to see \u2013 if I understand your question right, we are not getting a bunch of price there. What you are seeing is you are seeing the market come back in terms of capital spend around mobile kind of truck builds in the LPG mobile markets, that\u2019s been the biggest so far. Jeffrey Reive : All right, and then switching gears a little bit on your water market, can you talk to how municipal budgets are looking. Andy Silvernai : Yeah, I think that they are healthy, right. So if you look at the expected spend; if you look at head count that we track, all those point in the right direction. Bill Grogan : Yeah, the surveys we\u2019ve down with our metro markets show low single improvement over the next 12 months. Andy Silvernai : Yeah. Jeffrey Reive : All right, thank you. Andy Silvernai : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Charley Brady from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question. Charley Brady : Thanks. Good morning guys. Andy Silvernai : Hey Charley. Charley Brady : Hey, could you just talk about raw material cost pressure that you are seeing. I didn\u2019t hear any \u2013 maybe I missed it, but I didn\u2019t hear any mention of that on the call. Obviously what you are seeing is it\u2019s not hurting the margins, but I\u2019m just kind of \u2013 maybe drill down on that a little bit, where you are seeing it, to what degree? Bill Grogan : No, I mean we\u2019ve seen some pockets in the more commodity based raw materials, but nothing material overall to the portfolio. I think I mentioned it a little bit earlier, I think in the areas of some of the industrial businesses where we have seen a little bit increase in the commodity prices we\u2019ve been able to go out proactively with incremental price increases. So again, keeping ahead of that price cost curve. Andy Silvernai : We expect to see it Charley, right. So we expect to see material and labor inflation as we get into \u201918. It\u2019s fully our view that that\u2019s coming, and if anything I think that the expectations of it are low. I think we are in a very tight scenario, tighter than most people fully appreciate around the supply chain and around labor and that I think the light switch is going to happen. It\u2019s going to be faster and it\u2019s going to be brighter and that\u2019s what we are playing for. So all of our work around productivity and all of our work around our outbound pricing is with that as a backdrop. Charley Brady : And that assumption is backed into your incremental outlook of 35% incremental margin expectation, right? Andy Silvernai : It is. Charley Brady : Just one more follow-up. On the dispensing orders you got, particularly the large one, what\u2019s the timing on when that ought to ship out? Bill Grogan : Well, we got, most of it in the fourth quarter. Andy Silvernai : There is some that goes into \u201918 but most of it goes into the fourth quarter. And if you think about it, what that means Charley is that our fourth quarter is plus or minus ratable of the third quarter, right, if you just kind of back into the numbers we gave you. It means that the third and the fourth quarter sequentially look flat. Bill Grogan : Yes. Charley Brady : Got it. Great, thanks. Andy Silvernai : You bet Charley. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey of Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Brett Linzey : Hi, good morning all. Andy Silvernai : Good morning Brett. Brett Linzey : Hey, back to FMC, a really nice quarter on the margin there, all time highs. I guess structurally as you look at the business, the mix, you know new products and some of the restructuring you\u2019ve done. What\u2019s really the margin entitlement of that business? And then I guess as we look into \u201918, are there costs that need to come back as you look to meet some of these order increases? Andy Silvernai : Yeah, you know so I think we are targeting kind of 27 area plus or minus here in FMT. In terms of cost coming back materially there will be some, right. You know we\u2019ve had a pretty strong rebound; we\u2019ve got some double digit growers, and there are some places where in terms of more people capacity, it\u2019s not plant and equipment but people capacity, we will do some of that, but it won\u2019t get in the way of healthy incremental and so we will do that. We are going through our budgeting cycle now and there is nothing that\u2019s shocking in any of that stuff so far, but there will be some ads that we got to do to make sure that we can keep up with the improvement. And then we should be able to deliver the kind of the incrementals you\u2019d expect. Brett Linzey : And maybe just back to the strat cycle. I mean obviously the lens here is turning to 2018 and you know I know you don\u2019t want to provide too much color. But based on product momentum, the channel development, a lot of the things you touch on. Do you think the H2 run rate is a decent place order for 2018 and maybe half that market, half that self help, but any early framework that teams are providing as part of that planning cycle? Andy Silvernai : You know I actually, I haven\u2019t looked at it like that, right, so kind of saying second half becomes first half. I think that\u2019s probably a little too high. I have to look at how that actually layers out. But generally I think the way I would expect it is in terms of seasonality, I expect it to look like it historically looked like. I don\u2019t think there is going to be any major bumps on the road you know.  US industrial production, the latest estimates right now are coming in at you know 2% to 2.5% plus or minus, right, and that\u2019s going to be 50%, 60% of our businesses, and so as I think about what our underlying markets are likely to look like, that feels about right, if you look at it in the US and then on a global basis. And then obviously our goal is to beat that in a meaningful way. We\u2019ve talked about our long term objective is how do you get 200 basis points better. And so as we go into the year, you should not expect out story to change. Brett Linzey : Okay, great. Thanks guys. Andy Silvernai : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano from Cowen & Co. Please proceed with your question. Joe Giordano : Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. When I look at FMT, and we\u2019ve seen a lot of people talk about aftermarket people servicing each other\u2019s products and other cheaper low cost countries being able to produce things better now than they used to. I know your margin structure seems to less of an issue, but can you talk about how you look at your portfolio overall in that context like on a, like a continuous basis. Andy Silvernai : Yeah, I think Joe what your really referencing tend to be the bigger iron commoditized products where people need incredible reach to get to their customers and they have service cycles that have a lot of intensity to them. And by the way, not very many skews and lots of volume. We don\u2019t fit that model at all, right. We tend to be very nitchy. There is a lot of specification and customization that goes into working with the customer and so that mix and that customization tends to really become a barrier to entry for your classic sort of low cost, more commoditized pieces of business and how those competitors compete. So we don\u2019t see that a lot. I don\u2019t expect to see that a lot. You see it around the edges, but you are going to see it much more with the folks that we compete with. We are not \u2013 and that\u2019s right, we are in market where we don\u2019t compete with, that are much more commoditized. That\u2019s where I think that risk really stems from. Joe Giordano : That\u2019s fair rough. And then just I wanted to clarify on some of the incremental discussion we\u2019ve had. Is the variable cost that we are talking about, is that all coming through the corporate line? And when you are talking about your certified guide, is that on the \u2013 are we talking just like on a segment basis? Bill Grogan : So there is some incorporated and it\u2019s on that segmented out to each of the individual segments. Andy Silvernai : Yeah sorry, I misspoke, but in total for the quarter, again it\u2019s almost $6 million. Joe Giordano : Right, we are talking like of the 35% guide that you are like on a normalize basis. Do you mean that like a segment level or like a total\u2026 Andy Silvernai : Total company, total company. Joe Giordano : Okay. Andy Silvernai : Yeah, sorry. Joe Giordano : Cool, I just wanted to clarify that. And then just last from me, your comments on muni I think we\u2019re pretty clear. I guess we had some conflicting data points from our a few companies this morning. So the strength that you are seeing there, you are not seeing that as just an IDEX specific aspect or maybe you are outperforming a little bit and you think the underlying markets kind of that you are playing globally look pretty strong, are pretty consistent right now. Andy Silvernai : I think the underling markets are good as Bill referenced. You know we are talking kind of low since digits, but they are certainly not rolling over so they continue to robust and we are winning. We got some really good new product development that\u2019s going into those markets and we are seeing strength. Joe Giordano : Great, thanks guys. Andy Silvernai : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Katja Jancic from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Katja Jancic : Hi. Thank you for talking my questions. Andy Silvernai : Good morning. Katja Jancic : Incrementals in HSTs were lower than in first half. Is that completely because of inefficiencies or is there something else? Andy Silvernai : It\u2019s all the inefficiencies right. So the bulk of what we saw in the quarter happened for the whole company but they were in HST, it\u2019s all tied to that. Katja Jancic : Okay. Can you rank sales growth by end market and FMT and also in FSD? Andy Silvernai : That would be tough to do. Its \u2013 obviously -- I\u2019ll do my best, I\u2019ll do my best and Bill. So the industrial stuff, the cyclical stuff that\u2019s picked up is going to be the highest right. So if you look at what\u2019s happening in the industrial FMT that\u2019s going to be the highest. Banjo and Ag is going to be strong, there is no doubt about that. They are going to be close and then you got water within FMT.  You go over to HST, obviously what we are seeing within Life Sciences is going to be strong. Sealing actually might even be a little bit better that than, but they are close, they are both in that double digit range, so those are doing well.  You know the Sealing story is a great story. That\u2019s a place where we made multiple acquisitions, we built a platform, we made a greenfield investment in the US to penetrate the US market and we are really seeing some nice wins there. If you move over to you know to Diversified and BAND-IT has been really strong, right. BAND-IT has been strong and obviously found the dispensing business we had, nice order growth there in the quarter. But it\u2019s hard to, if you were to look at every business, if you guys had access to that the signals across the portfolio are pretty good. Katja Jancic : Now I\u2019m not sure if you mentioned this, but what were water sales \u2013 what was water sales growth? Andy Silvernai : We don\u2019t call that out specifically. Katja Jancic : Okay. Now I know you made a couple of divestitures in \u201916. Are those impact on sales complete or should we still look at that? Bill Grogan : In the fourth quarter we\u2019ll have\u2026 Michael Yates : We sold IETG in the fourth quarter and the Korean... Andy Silvernai : How much is that going to be, total for the fourth quarter? Bill Grogan : That\u2019s a couple of million bucks. Andy Silvernai : It\u2019s not a big number, but yeah there will be a little bit. Katja Jancic : Okay, and I know historically you talked about your fixed businesses. Can you talk a little bit about the margin progression there? Are there any businesses that you still expect to graduate from that group? Andy Silvernai : Oh yeah! We\u2019ll definitely graduate some this year. As you know we\u2019ve talked about the idea that you kind of get two years in that bucket and so I expect that we are going to graduate some folks out of that bucket this year. You know if we do any acquisitions, you know those obviously go into that automatically, but we continue to see nice margin expansion and frankly growth out of those businesses. You know it\u2019s been unexpectedly strong. So the focus that we are doing there is both improving top line and improving the bottom line. Katja Jancic : Perfect. Thank you very much. Andy Silvernai : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brett Kearney from Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your question. Brett Kearney : Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. Andy Silvernai : You bet Brett. Brett Kearney : I just had a question of your pumps businesses. The double digit growth you are seeing in those businesses, would you say that also breaks down about half end market growth and half discreet wins and can you comment at all\u2026 Andy Silvernai : Yeah, it\u2019s not materially different. Brett Kearney : Okay. Can you comment at all on who you might be getting share from or kind of the specific maybe product lines where you are seeing the wins there? Andy Silvernai : Yeah, one of the big wins for us has been in the lease custody transfer market which is called LACT, where our Viking business has \u2013 they are a new product development and really market development. They just had a great year and they won some really large chunks of businesses. In terms of talking about competitors specifically, I won\u2019t get into that, but that\u2019s been a big win for them. And then again if you look at what\u2019s happened, you know kind of across our portfolio with the cyclical upturn of those businesses have done well. But specifically within the pumps businesses, LACT has been a big driver for us. Brett Kearney : Okay, great. Thank you. Andy Silvernai : You bet. Operator : There are no further questions in the queue. I\u2019d like to hand the call back over to management for closing comments. Andy Silvernail : Well, as always we appreciate your interest in IDEX. I am obviously very pleased with how our teams are performing, whether talking about our focus on organic growth, our discipline in utilizing our capital, our ability to drive margin expansion and cash flow, the team is just doing an outstanding job. So I look forward to talking to you here, to talk about the fourth quarter results in 90 days or so. I expect that we\u2019ll finish the fourth quarter strong and look forward to position ourselves well for 2018. So again, thanks for your time and your support and we\u2019ll talk to you in 90 days. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

This call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbor language in today\u2019s press release and in IDEX\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I\u2019ll now turn this call over to our Chairman and CEO, Andy Silvernail. Andy Silvernail : Thanks, Mike. Hey, good morning, everybody. I appreciate you joining us to talk about the 2017 full year and, obviously, our fourth quarter results. I\u2019m going to start with a brief overview of 2017 and what we expect to see here in 2018. Look, 2017 was a record for IDEX. Market conditions around the globe continued to improve throughout the year, and our team is positioned very, very well to capitalize on the strength. We delivered organic revenue and order growth in all four quarters as well as all-time quarter and annual highs in orders, sales, operating margin, EPS and free cash flow. I\u2019m extremely pleased with the team\u2019s ability to execute our targeted growth initiatives, which really contributed to this record results for the year. The strength is broad-based across almost the entire portfolio, which I\u2019ll elaborate on here in a minute. And our balance sheet is extremely strong. Our gross debt leverage ratio is 1.4 times, and our net debt leverage ratio is 0.8 times. If you combine our strong balance sheet with the $700 million of availability on our revolver plus our free cash flow in 2018, we\u2019ll have the ability to deploy over $1 billion in the next 12 months. Of course, we remain very disciplined and ensure that we get our best returns for our shareholders not only in the short-term but, most importantly, in the long term. Speaking of which, I\u2019d like to take the opportunity to welcome our newest acquisition, thinXXS, to the IDEX family. We\u2019ll talk more about the acquisition in a bit, but we\u2019re very happy to have this innovative team as part of our organization. Given the sustained strength in the back half of the year, we remain optimistic about our ability to continue to grow. We\u2019re projecting 5% organic growth in 2018, with full year EPS in the range of $4.19 to $5.10 a share. Using the midpoint of our 2018 EPS guidance, $5, EPS is up $0.69 or 16% compared with 2017 adjusted EPS of $4.31. About 60% of the increase is due to targeted growth and operational initiatives, with the remaining 40% coming from the expected 2018 effective tax rate that will be in the range of 22% to 23%. Now I\u2019d like to take a moment to talk about what we\u2019ve seen across the markets we serve and the regions we do business in. The industrial markets have really showed continued worldwide momentum throughout the year and provided a nice finish here in 2017. More project opportunities are providing indications of continued strength in 2018, and I see this really as a release of more CapEx into the marketplace. The IVD/BIO, analytical instrumentation and DNA sequencing markets were great all last year, and we expect strength to continue. We continue to leverage our differentiated position as a market leader in Fluidics and in Optics, specifically within Life Sciences. The ag market, really, has been strong throughout 2017, and we expect it to continue into 2018 based on the good pre-order season we saw in the fourth quarter. The upstream energy market has been strong all year. As a reminder, our exposure in this market is minimal, but the strength in the upstream market does provide a lift across general industrial markets, and we\u2019re definitely seeing that in our pump businesses in FMT. The midstream energy market is stable, and we\u2019re optimistic as this market has continued to show signs of improvement on the back of a cold winter. Municipal end markets in both fire and water continued to see positive demand throughout the year, and we will continue with new product development in water and investments in emerging markets within fire to capitalize on this demand. We experienced strength across all of our regions in 2017. The North American region continues to be strong and is the leading in the recovery for us. The European market gained strength throughout the year, and we expect market growth to continue. And increased government funding and initiatives in Asia are driving strength across many markets, including environmental and water treatment, transportation, pharma and fire and rescue. I want to take a minute here and recap our commitment to our capital deployment strategy. I think what\u2019s most important to note is we have set a capital deployment framework, which we believe very strongly in. And even with the changes in the tax rates in the U.S., we don\u2019t expect to have to change how we think about deploying capital, but rather to continue to be aggressive within that framework. As I mentioned earlier, in December, we acquired thinXXS, a leader in the design, manufacture and sale of microfluidic components in the life science markets. We anticipate that the synergies between thinXXS and our existing microfluidics technologies in our Scientific Fluidics & Optics businesses will position us well in the next generation of microfluidics technologies as they\u2019re deployed. Once again, we welcome thinXXS to our team. We also took the opportunity to divest our Faure Herman business within the Energy group. The divestiture is consistent with our segmentation strategy. We sold Faure Herman for $21.8 million, which resulted in a $9.3 million gain. We will continue to invest in the best organic growth opportunities, and I\u2019m extremely pleased with both the fourth quarter and full year organic growth rates in orders and sales across the company. This is the result of our team\u2019s dedication to our targeted growth initiatives and our segmentation strategy, and organic growth remains our top priority within the company. We remain committed to opportunistically repurchasing shares, and that will not change in 2018. In 2017, we repurchased 266,000 shares for $29 million or an average purchase price of $109 a share. We increased our dividend 9% in 2017. And in 2018, subject to board approval, we intend to increase our dividend 15% to 18%, which will allow us to hit the high end of our goal to distribute 30% to 35% of earnings to our shareholders. Okay. Before I get into the IDEX financial results for the fourth quarter and full year, I\u2019d like to provide a few comments regarding the impact to IDEX of Tax Reform in the United States. Tax Reform will no doubt bolster our already strong financial profile by providing additional earnings, cash flow and capital availability. We intend to put this additional capital to work consistent with our balanced capital deployment strategy, as I just outlined. All in, the net impact from Tax Reform in 2017 were basically awash. However, we did have various puts and takes related to this. The remeasurement of our U.S. deferred taxes at the lower enacted corporate tax rate of 21% provided us with a $40.6 million tax benefit. However, this benefit was almost entirely offset by a $30.2 million of repatriation tax expense as well as $10.3 million of additional tax expense tied to tax planning strategies that we implemented in the fourth quarter and were tied to the enactment of the Tax Act. This additional charge of $10.3 million will provide us flexibility and access to our cash across the globe. All right. Let\u2019s switch gears here. Let\u2019s talk about the 2017 financial results. I\u2019m on Slide 5. As noted on this slide, the GAAP results were adjusted for restructuring in both 2017 and 2016 as well as the gain on sale of business in 2017 and net loss on sale of businesses in 2016. And as I mentioned a moment ago, the Tax Reform is essentially awash, and we did not adjust for the results for any impact from it. I\u2019ll start with full year results. Order growth for the year was 9%, with organic orders up 7%. FSD finished the year with double-digit organic growth in both the third and the fourth quarters. FMT and HST delivered robust organic order growth consistent throughout the entire year. For the full year, we had $2.3 billion of revenue, which was up 8% compared to prior year, up 6% organically. All three segments contributed to organic revenue growth for the year. FMT was up 6%, HST was up 8%, and FSD was up 4%. Gross margin was 44.9% for the year, which was up 90 basis points. Adjusting for the prior year inventory step-up charges, gross margin was up 20 basis points. Op margin, adjusted for the gain on divestiture and restructuring expense, was 21.9% for the year, up 120 basis points compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher volume and productivity initiatives as well as the dilutive impact of the inventory step-up charge in the prior year. Excluding the impact from prior inventory step-up charges, adjusted operating margin was up 50 basis points for the year. Full year EPS was $4.36, while adjusted EPS was $4.31. That was up $0.56 or 15% compared to the adjusted prior year EPS. Our full year effective tax rate was 25.9%, and that included the impact from the gain on the divestiture and restructuring expenses. Our adjusted full year effective tax rate excluding the impact of these items was 26.6%. Free cash flow of $389 million was a record for IDEX and converted into 170% of net income compared to prior year. For the fourth quarter results, they\u2019re really strong here. Orders were very strong across all three segments in the fourth quarter, resulting in overall growth for the company at 10% and organic growth of 9%. Revenue was $586 million, which was up 10% overall and 9% organically. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 22.1%, up 150 basis points year-over-year due in part to the pressure from the fair value inventory step-up in the prior year. Excluding this charge, adjusted operating margin was up 60 basis points for the year-over-year. Fourth quarter EPS was $1.21, while adjusted EPS was $1.12, which is a $0.16 or 17%increase over the prior year. Our Q4 effective tax rate of 24.2% includes the impact from the gain on the divestitures and restructuring expense. Our adjusted Q4 effective tax rate excluding the impact of these items was 26.4%. Free cash flow in the quarter was outstanding, $120 million, which is a 14% increase year-over-year and 139% of Q4 adjusted net income. Okay. I\u2019d like to start with the segment discussion now. I\u2019m on Slide 6, and we\u2019ll start with Fluid & Metering. FMT had a very solid 2017 on both the top and the bottom line. Organic orders were up 9% in the fourth quarter, 7% for the full year. Organic sales were up 7% in the fourth quarter and 6% for the full year. Adjusted op margin was 28.4%, which is up 100 basis points, while full year adjusted op margin of 27.7% was up 200 basis points from the prior year primarily due to higher volume and productivity initiatives. In water, we had a solid finish to the year, driven in part by strong distribution markets in the U.S. and UK. And we continue to focus on new product development across our water businesses and leverage that technology to gain share. On the industrial side, our pump business was very strong, with orders and sales benefiting from the improving economy and the upstream impact of oil and gas. The LACT pump, which really has been a big win for us here and principally in the upstream oil and gas market, continues to gain traction. We have a strong project funnel as we look at 2018. And finally, U.S. distribution channel also finished with day rates improving throughout the year. In terms of valves within the industrial group, we saw improvement in the U.S., Canada and Europe as well as in encouraging signs in the chemical markets. With energy, we continue to see market share gains in LPG mobile, increasing truck builds. As I mentioned earlier, the cold winter should help this business. In agriculture, as we\u2019ve been seeing all year, the ag story has been great in 2017, and we expect this to continue in 2018 given what we saw with the nice pre-order market in the fourth quarter. Okay. I\u2019m on Slide 7, and we\u2019ll talk here on Health & Science. Q4 organic orders were up 7%, with full year organic orders up 8%. Organic sales were up 11% in Q4, up 8% organically for the full year. Adjusted Q4 op margin of 22.3% increased 330 basis points, while full year op margin of 22.5% increased 170 basis points. Both increases were primarily driven by the fair value inventory step-up that we took in prior year, coupled with higher volume. If you exclude the fair value inventory step-up from the prior year, adjusted operating margin would have been up 100 basis points for the quarter. Our growth initiatives, including higher engineering investments in HST, and targeted initiatives are working, especially in Sealing and Scientific Fluidics & Optics. However, with these successes come some challenges on margins. Specifically, we continue to have some operating challenges that relate to growth, but we\u2019re making a lot of progress on this throughout the year. We expect segment margin to be higher than 22.3% in the fourth quarter on 11% organic growth. Our operating teams are focused on this opportunity, and we expect this to improve throughout 2018. If we look at Scientific Fluidics & Optics, it was a very strong year for the group with continued gains and momentum across the major markets of AI, IVD/BIO and DNA sequencing. Also, we announced our Optics Center of Excellence in Rochester, New York scheduled to be completed by early 2019. This project will bring three separate businesses together in a brand-new, state-of-the-art building, with the sole mission of supporting the growth of our key life science customers. Looking at Sealing Solutions, we experienced a record year, driven in part by very strong semicon demand but also propelled even further by oil and gas, mining, automotive and our own initiatives in new product development. HST industrial remains solid, looks a lot like what we just discussed in FMT. Within our material process business, we\u2019ve seen continued global stability with increased demand in the U.S. food and pharma markets, along with strong project funnel as we enter 2018. Okay, I\u2019m on Slide 8. I\u2019m on our last segment, Diversified. Diversified also had a really good year. They delivered a record fourth quarter in orders, sales and op margin. Organic orders grew 11% in the fourth quarter, 5% for the year. Organic sales grew 12% in the fourth quarter and 4% for the year. Adjusted Q4 op margin of 26.5% was up 250 basis points, while full year adjusted op margin of 25.1% was up 110 basis points. This is primarily due to higher volume and productivity issues. In addition to the higher volume and productivity, Akron Brass and AWG are integrating very well into our legacy Fire & Rescue businesses. When we acquired them in the summer of 2016, we had an objective to increase EBITDA margins by 500 basis points over three years. We are 75% of our way towards that goal in 1.5 years, and this is evidenced by the very strong 26.5% op margins in the fourth quarter. If you look at Dispensing, we\u2019ve got continuous stability in the North America market, which is coupled with growing strength in Europe and Asia. Our X-Smart business continues to be strong in emerging markets, and we\u2019re beginning to see traction of our growth initiatives as our next phase of new products are being launched globally. Within Fire & Rescue, the muni and North American OEM markets continue to perform well, and we\u2019ve seen a return of projects in emerging markets, which is encouraging. Finally, Band-It. Band-It continues to deliver across their various markets, including transportation, energy and industrial. All right. We\u2019re down to the last couple pieces of our conversation here. Let\u2019s talk about 2018 guidance and then, specifically, the fourth quarter. I\u2019m on Slide 9. So we anticipate full year organic growth in 2018 to be 5%, which will contribute $0.34 to $0.45 of benefit to EPS. FX is expected to be a $0.06 tailwind in 2018. We are impacted mostly by translational fluctuations from the euro, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar and British pound. We\u2019re basing our analysis on rates as of December 31, 2017. We expect the net impact of our 2017 divestiture of Faure Herman and our 2017 acquisition of thinXXS to represent $0.03 of pressure on EPS. Our productivity initiatives will more than fully offset wage and raw material inflation in 2018 and will provide a $0.05 benefit. As noted before, we\u2019ll continue to focus on our best organic growth opportunities. We will invest in people, along with a focus on new products and new applications of our existing products. These investments are across all of our segments, and these growth investments will be approximately $0.08 of pressure in 2018. We\u2019ve shown a subtotal of EPS of $4.65 to $4.75, which represents what operational EPS improvement in 2018 would have been prior to Tax Reform. That\u2019s a 9% improvement at the midpoint. We anticipate the Tax Reform will provide $0.25 to $0.35 benefit to our bottom line. So the result in EPS is in the range of $4.90 to $5.10, so at the midpoint of $5, EPS would be up 16% compared to 2017 adjusted EPS of $4.31. I\u2019ll now conclude with some additional details regarding our 2018 guidance for the first quarter and full year. I\u2019m on the last slide, Slide 10. In Q1, we estimate EPS ranging from $1.20 to $1.24, with organic revenue growth of 5% to 6% and operating margins of approximately 22%. Q1 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 22.5%, with an estimated 3% \u2013 excuse me, 3% top line tailwind from FX based on December 31 rates. Corporate costs for the first quarter are expected to be in the range of $17 million to $18 million. Turning to full year 2018. We expect EPS to be in the range of $4.90 to $5.10. Full year organic growth is expected to be approximately 5%, and full year operating margin, approximately 22.5% to 23%. The top line FX impact is approximately 1% tailwind, again, based on end-of-year rates. The full year effective tax rate is in the range of 22% to 23%, and capital expenditures will be around $50 million. Free cash flow is expected to remain strong at approximately 115% to 120% conversion rate, and corporate costs are expected to be in the range of $70 million to $74 million for the year. Finally, our earnings guidance excludes any associated cost of future acquisitions or restructuring charges. With that, let me pause and turn it over to operator, Doug, for details. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Allison Poliniak : Hi guys, good morning. Andy Silvernail : Good morning, Allison. Allison Poliniak : Andy, could you touch on organic investment a little bit more? You\u2019ve obviously invested very broadly here. But with the incremental cash that you\u2019re now going to get from the Tax Reform, is there any specific area that you think you could accelerate some investment in just based on the traction you\u2019re getting? Andy Silvernail : Allison, we figured we\u2019d get this question. Across the board, it came down to the increase in earnings and cash from the tax rate. And the bottom line is not really. And what I mean by that is we have been very aggressive across the board for years now at fully funding organic, and I think we\u2019ve been very consistent in saying that even when that\u2019s done, there\u2019s plenty of money left over. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve left much on the table. Last year, we had a pretty good number in terms of incremental organic investments. This year, it\u2019s $0.08 a share. So I don\u2019t think, when you net it all out, it changes much of anything from our strategy. And I think it\u2019s \u2013 in terms of our ability to be competitive and to win globally, it\u2019s obviously a positive thing. But I don\u2019t think it changes what we spend our time on and where we\u2019re going to invest. Allison Poliniak : That\u2019s helpful. And then HST, with the operational inefficiencies in 2017, it sounds like they\u2019re dragging into 2018. Andy Silvernail : Yes. Allison Poliniak : Could you help us quantify that impact in 2017, how you\u2019re thinking about it for 2018? And should those kind of disappear as we go through the year? Andy Silvernail : Yes. So actually, it\u2019s under one headline. But to be candid, there\u2019s one piece that we\u2019ve kind of put behind us and two pieces that we haven\u2019t. So when I say that we had \u2013 we did a major consolidation up in Canada, which we had some bumps earlier in the year, and that was kind of some of the bigger dollars earlier in the year. And we fundamentally \u2013 those things are never done until you\u2019re humming completely, but we feel really good about where that is, and the team there has done a great job of closing that off. But two things that we\u2019re more wrestling with right now are really around very fast-growth rates and as we look at some of the more scientifically bent pieces of our portfolio. So what we\u2019re experiencing is more around \u2013 think of it as expedites a little higher cost of internal quality than we would expect. In the quarter, it was about $1.5 million, Allison. And frankly, we\u2019re \u2013 basically, we\u2019re protecting our customers to make sure that they\u2019re not feeling these inefficiencies or longer lead times, and we\u2019re easing some of the costs ourselves. So it was $1.5 million in the fourth quarter. And if you normalize the HST margin, frankly, that\u2019s the kind of margin we would expect to see in HST if you normalize that $1 million, $1.5 million. I don\u2019t think we completely put it to bed just because we\u2019re not going to \u2013 we\u2019re not going to try to save $0.5 million to put our customers at risk. And so if it takes a little bit longer to make sure we get it right at all angles, we\u2019ll do it. I think it\u2019s going to go into the second quarter before we have it completely behind us. Allison Poliniak : Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Andy Silvernail : Yes. No problem at all. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran from Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Mike Halloran : Hey, good morning, guys. Andy Silvernail : Good morning. Mike Halloran : So maybe when I think back to prepared comments, Andy, and I think about the prepared comments over the last five, six quarters, the level of caution continues to bleed out of the comments. And I did not hear a lot of concern points in the script. Andy Silvernail : Yes. Mike Halloran : Any areas of the portfolio you\u2019re worried about right now? Or are we just seeing broad-based growth through all of your business lines at this point? Andy Silvernail : It\u2019s broad-based, Mike. You read this correctly. At this point, it\u2019s pretty hard to find a piece of the portfolio that is soft. I mean, if I were going to pick a little bit, it would be the places that we\u2019ve been picking on, but even those have gotten better since we last talked, meaning the Dispensing business in North America has flattened out. And the midstream energy, we thought, bottomed out in the fourth \u2013 excuse me, in the third quarter, and we believe that to be true, and has improved, and the cold winter will help that even some there. So when you do a Pareto of all of our businesses, if I showed you a Pareto chart of all of our businesses, a couple of things that you would see negative are by our choice. We actively made choices to shrink a couple of things. Otherwise than that, you\u2019d see positives. Mike Halloran : And then extending out Allison\u2019s first question a little bit. Obviously, your investment hurdles haven\u2019t really changed. You guys have been diligent on your side. Andy Silvernail : Yes. Mike Halloran : How do you feel this is going to impact your customer base and what their investment decisions look like? And how does that layer through in your business? Andy Silvernail : That\u2019s a great question. I think that is a big one. You mean \u2013 if I understand, Mike, you mean in terms of will they invest more, and therefore, will that cause a downstream effect. Is that what you mean? Mike Halloran : Yes, that\u2019s exactly it. Andy Silvernail : Yes. Well, I think \u2013 I mean, I think for everybody, the answer to that, to some degree, is going to be yes. And whether that happens directly or it happens with how money gets circulated in the economy via dividends or whatever, right, I think the answer to that is going to be yes. I will caution, however, that these things tend to have \u2013 because of where we play in the marketplace, there might be a little bit longer, I think, impact for that to turn into a structural change, meaning brand-new programs coming in, where we\u2019ve won new products. I think that the short-term impact is going to be on book and turn business, right, stuff that you\u2019ve already won, and you might get some incremental benefits. And I do think that we\u2019re seeing that and we have seen that. And the bigger thing that we\u2019re looking at is the confidence level in capital-related projects, right? And when you see \u2013 if you remember, I want to say two or three calls ago, Bill, must have been, or maybe assuming the beginning of last year, people were asking us, what would give you more confidence? And I believe my answer back then was you got to see what I\u2019ll call the speculative confidence turn into the spending confidence, turn into the capital spending confidence. And I believe we\u2019ve entered that phase. And so we\u2019re definitely starting to see people more willing to spend bigger dollars, which is what makes it sustained for folks like us as long as it holds up. Mike Halloran : Yes. Bill Grogan : Yes, I would add. Our commercial funnels across the portfolio have picked up, especially over the last quarter. I think the upside case would be if a significant amount of those materialized here in 2018. Andy Silvernail : I agree with that, Bill. Mike Halloran : Yes, yes. And then just for me tack under that one, Andy, on the CapEx side because I remember those comments a couple quarters back, and the hope was \u2013 CapEx have scaled back part of this year, right? Andy Silvernail : Yes. Mike Halloran : It certainly feels like you\u2019re more confident that CapEx of maybe not massive size but more meaningful size is starting to come forward. Is that fair? And how do you see that projecting out? Andy Silvernail : It is fair. Now let me give you three examples without being specific to any customers because we never do that, but three places where you\u2019re seeing that common in size. One, we\u2019re seeing it in the chemical markets. Whether \u2013 no matter if you look in Europe or you look in the value, so to speak, we\u2019re definitely seeing improvement and bigger dollars being released in those areas. In China, actually, too. China, too. And then \u2013 so that\u2019s number one. Number two, we received some pretty good-sized blanket orders, and it\u2019s not atypical. But in our general industrial \u2013 touching some of our general industrial book and turn businesses. And if you went back two years ago, those didn\u2019t exist. Then last year, it came back a little bit, and this year, we saw it come back stronger. That\u2019s a good sign. And then finally, in some of our scientific-related businesses, you\u2019re seeing people plan much further out related to their own capital. And the questions to us are around our ability to ramp if they ramp capital. So you\u2019re not necessarily seeing the spend yet, but when that conversation is happening, they\u2019re gauging \u2013 they\u2019re starting to now gauge who am I going to partner with based on availability, not just based on price, not that we ever really play in that much. Mike Halloran : Yes. Andy Silvernail : But you\u2019re seeing some of those behavioral changes. Mike Halloran : Great colors as always. Appreciate it. Andy Silvernail : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Nathan Jones : Good morning, everyone. Andy Silvernail : Hi, Nathan. Nathan Jones : I\u2019d just like to follow on to the question there about larger capital spending dollars coming out. That would probably hit you in the second half of the year. But I would guess that, that\u2019s probably not baked into the guidance that you have for 5-ish percent organic growth. I know you\u2019re going to have tougher comps in the second half, and I assume that, that\u2019s probably part of it. If you do see some of those positive spending drivers come through, is there upside to your organic revenue guidance, in your view? Andy Silvernail : I think, Nathan, you have to believe \u2013 for the answer to that to be yes, you have to believe that there\u2019s going to be an overall pickup in industrial production in the back half of the year compared to what we\u2019ve been experiencing now and the projections in the first half. And so far, we\u2019re not seeing that yet. So we are baking in some of this improvement. You\u2019re right. We do have tougher comps in the back half. Could it get better with an acceleration overall in organic spending through the pipeline, so to speak? It could, but the nature of the short cycle of our business and by nature of what we\u2019re seeing people think about in the back half of the year and full year from industrial production, I think we picked reasonably well with the facts that we have today. Nathan Jones : Okay, that\u2019s fair. I\u2019d like to go on to some of the businesses that have or continue to be in your fixed bucket. Andy Silvernail : Yes. Nathan Jones : You disposed one that I assume didn\u2019t pass your standards there. I know some of the acquisitions go into that. Can you give us an update on where you are with the businesses that are in the fixed bucket? Are they candidates for disposition? Are they candidates for moving out of that fixed bucket? Andy Silvernail : Sure, sure. Let me comment on, and I\u2019m going to ask Bill to comment, too, because Bill plays a really big role here in looking at the overall portfolio of the company on a day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month basis. So first of all, the fixed bucket has shrunk from about 25% this time last year to about 15%, right? So whether it\u2019s been disposition or folks moving from there to different parts of our growth profile, that\u2019s shrunk now. So it\u2019s a smaller piece of the overall profile. The first part, I don\u2019t think that there are \u2013 there\u2019s nothing major in line for disposition in there, right? We\u2019ve always said we\u2019ll constantly look at it. Things change, but I feel very good about where we are relative to what we own today. So that 15% that\u2019s in there is really about those two types of changes that we\u2019ve talked about for a long time. One is they got to improve their profit profile and/or they have something important in there that makes up their franchise that needs investment, I\u2019d say as a technology or channel development. So they generally feel pretty good. And Bill? Bill Grogan : Yes. I think the fixed businesses overall, the margin from them last year was about 200 basis points, so we did see a significant portion graduate out. Remember, all of our acquisitions go into the fixed business, so you saw Akron and AWG graduate into the integrated growth in SFC and then into integrated growth within our Dispensing \u2013 or excuse me, our Sealing platform. So the 15% that remains relative to productivity improvements we have in line this year, that will continue to shrink if we don\u2019t do any additional deals this year. Nathan Jones : Okay. As it relates to that, gross margins have been \u2013 they\u2019ve been edging up over the last few years, but they\u2019ve been in that kind of 44%, 45% range. Andy Silvernail : Yes. Nathan Jones : Are there opportunities that you feel you still have to drive gross margins higher? Or does margin expansion really come from SG&A leverage here? Or just how should we think about that going forward? Andy Silvernail : Nathan, I think we can get both, and there\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t continue to do that. If you look at our ability to get price, our ability to drive productivity, so if you kind of look at those two major things, so let\u2019s look at price versus \u2013 price and productivity versus inflation, meaning wage plus our raw material inflation, we think we can get \u2013 with that combination, we should be able to get expansion, right? And that all shows up at the gross margin line. And then from there, obviously, you\u2019ve got volume leverage, and those two things combined should then compound at the op margin line. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any reason we can\u2019t. Frankly, I\u2019m not going to lie. I was a little disappointed on \u2013 at where we ended gross margin. I thought we could have expanded the gross margin more throughout this year, and we gave up a reasonable amount of it with some of these inefficiencies that we\u2019ve had. And what I like about it is our teams are just as upset, right? It\u2019s not like we\u2019re having to tell them that this is an issue. At the same time, you got to make bets. You got to make bets on growth, and you got to make bets on Center of Excellence and things like that. And I think on balance, those are paying off for us. But I do expect to expand gross margins, and I think we can, Bill. I mean, I think we can. Bill Grogan : Yes. I mean, you should see us this year consistently in the 45% range with improvement off of that. I think 46% would be a target longer term, but a solid 45%, mid-45% is a good number for this year. Andy Silvernail : Absolutely. Nathan Jones : Great color as usual. Thanks guys. Andy Silvernail : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker from UBS. Please proceed with your question. Steven Winoker : Thanks and good morning all. Andy Silvernail : Good morning, Steve. Steven Winoker : I just wanted to follow on that last question around gross margin and tie it to also the $0.05 of tailwind that you point to in 2018 for inflation net \u2013 or productivity net of inflation. Just maybe help us think about, and I know you separate pricing someplace else, but the dynamics there. A little more color would be helpful to break it apart. Andy Silvernail : You want to touch on it, Bill? Bill Grogan : Yes. I think the $0.05 improvement is really us solving some of the execution issues that we had within 2017, and then it\u2019s our continued OpEx programs exceeding our inbound inflation. That\u2019s how you think about it. Andy Silvernail : Steven, anytime you can net that out to positive, that just puts you in a great position to expand margin. Bill Grogan : Yes. It\u2019s a little bit higher than what we historically have guided because of the inefficiency we can put our finger on in 2017. Steven Winoker : Right. And that inflation is all material or you have wage elsewhere, correct? Bill Grogan : No, that\u2019s in the number as well. Andy Silvernail : That\u2019s in there. Steven Winoker : That\u2019s both. Andy Silvernail : Yes. Steven Winoker : Okay. And so on the material side, I know it\u2019s not a huge part of your cost structure, but what are you thinking given what we\u2019re seeing? Andy Silvernail : It\u2019s 40 bps. Bill Grogan : Yes, these are \u2013 40 bps this year. That\u2019s our expected. Andy Silvernail : Somewhere \u2013 $10 million, $12 million material inflation. It\u2019s somewhere in there, yes. Bill Grogan : Yes. So think of it, 40 bps. It\u2019s not huge, but it\u2019s definitely there. It\u2019s present. Steven Winoker : Okay. And then on the \u2013 maybe, Andy, if you could put a \u2013 I know you\u2019ve talked a bit \u2013 a lot about capital deployment already today, but a little finer point on quantifying the current M&A envelope within which you\u2019re working comfortably, particularly in light of, I guess, what, $200 million of overseas cash and all, et cetera. Andy Silvernail : Yes, I\u2019m a frustrated groom. Steven Winoker : [Indiscernible] Andy Silvernail : So we\u2019ve looked at a lot of stuff. We see \u2013 we have looked at a lot of stuff, and our funnel has a ton of stuff in it. And we walked away from a couple of things right at the end of last year that we put a ton effort into and principally around some of the same things we\u2019ve talked around, around price and around terms. And we have \u2013 with our board, we\u2019ve laid out a very detailed strategy that combines organic and inorganic and what makes an IDEX-like business and then, frankly, our ability to drive differentiation long term. And so we know what that looks like. We feel very comfortable with what we know, and we feel very comfortable with what we don\u2019t know. And so what I don\u2019t want to do is find us stretching into places where we don\u2019t bring something different and better to the business, and so I\u2019d rather remain disciplined there. So what we\u2019re seeing now is we\u2019re seeing a lot of behavior, and it\u2019s accelerating, right? And I expect tax relief to accelerate that to some degree. We\u2019re seeing a lot of behavior where people are paying mid-teen multiples for very good assets. But when you just kind of back through the math, it\u2019s tough to get there. And so I think \u2013 look, I\u2019m betting on the fact that we will be rewarded for discipline over the long term. And we might \u2013 hey, heck, we might get punched around a little bit in the short term for it, but I\u2019m okay with that. Steven Winoker : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And any kind of color again around the characteristics of \u2013 I know Faure Herman, that went to Le Garrec. And as you\u2019ve shrunk that fixed bucket down, I think it always helps us if you give us some insight into what makes that kind of business worth more to somebody else than to you guys. Andy Silvernail : Yes. So I think a few things, and I won\u2019t speak specifically to Faure Herman. But I think what it comes down to is the ability to drive real differentiation in the marketplace. And so when we looked at a bunch of the businesses that we have sold in the last few years, most of them came down to either we didn\u2019t have the scale to compete or we had lost the technology advantage that somebody else brought to the table that could advance that business much faster than we could organically. And so that\u2019s typically been the decision-making. Rarely is it because financially, you can\u2019t get there. We can solve those things pretty quickly. It really comes down to those two things : the ability to scale it and the ability to get over a technology hurdle. And for the most part, the buyers that we sold to are, I guess, for the most part, we think they could, and they think they could. And one of the things that we think about here, Steve, is it\u2019s good for everybody in terms of performance of the business. It\u2019s also good for the people in the business, right, because if \u2013 do you want to be part of a business where you are kind of forgotten? Or do you want to be part of a business where you are prime time? And so we think about that in the businesses we\u2019ve sold. They\u2019re going to partners. They\u2019re going to be prime time, and that\u2019s going to allow them to thrive and succeed. Steven Winoker : Great. All right, very helpful. Thanks guys. Good luck. Andy Silvernail : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Scott Graham : Hey good morning, guys. Look, just another quarter well done. I thought I could tell you. The one \u2013 I jumped on a little bit late. I apologize. We\u2019re spread really thin this morning. Could you \u2013 have you talked about the amount of fixed businesses that are still left in the portfolio, the percent of sales and approximately what their margins are running at right now? Andy Silvernail : Yes. So we did a little bit, so I won\u2019t spend much time on it. You can go back on the transcript. But basically, about 15% of our businesses are now in the fixed bucket. We made about 200 basis point improvement in margins. We don\u2019t talk about the specific margin profile that\u2019s in there today, but that\u2019s about what it is. But it was a longer conversation earlier. Scott Graham : Okay, got you. So now with \u2013 sort of piggybacking on the M&A question, and I know that your pipeline is looking good and all that, but can you give us an idea of what the pipeline is comprised of? You now have essentially 85%, which is a substantial portion of yourselves, of course, in businesses, which it sounds like you\u2019re really ready to make an acquisition next to alongside. So does the composite of your pipeline equal the percent of sales of these businesses? Or how are you looking at that, Andy? Andy Silvernail : Yes. So I\u2019m not \u2013 Scott, I\u2019m not exactly sure if I understand what you meant by that. But let me take a whack, and if I\u2019m wrong, come back at it. So I would actually look at the 75% because, really, most of the businesses that we\u2019ve categorized has outperformed. We\u2019re unlikely to acquire something in those businesses unless something popped out that was unexpected from a competitor that we could put together. So let\u2019s just call it 75% of the business I\u2019d categorize as ready and I\u2019m excited about acquiring around. Across that 75%, the pipeline is pretty good. I couldn\u2019t tell you that there\u2019s one thing versus another where we\u2019re seeing more or less of something. Now there\u2019s price disparity. When I look at the HST-related properties, they\u2019re more expensive. When I look at the FSD-related properties, they tend to be less expensive, and FMT is somewhere in the middle. And so we\u2019ve been looking at things for all of 2017 and even today that touch on all those businesses or adjacent to those businesses. We continue to invest in strategy. We continue to invest in people to think about how IDEX runs a business. If you think about the style of competition of IDEX, right, what makes us really different? We kind of come down to three things time and time and time again, right? Number one, we\u2019re really good at building teams who know how to run these businesses. The second part is those teams are obsessively customer-centric maybe in terms of how do you grow them, how do you care for them, how you innovate around them. And they do so through, really, this practice of 80-20, which has been the hallmark of our operating model. And so we keep investing in what other types of businesses that are adjacent to our world did that model work. And that\u2019s where our sweet spot is. It\u2019s got to have the dynamics of an IDEX business, but when we put those three things together, that\u2019s where acquisitions work for us. Scott Graham : Very good. That\u2019s all I had. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Jeffrey Reive : Good morning, this is Jeff on for Deane. I just have one question around the dynamic of Tax Reform on the M&A landscape. Sellers have less tax leakage. I was wondering if you\u2019re seeing any more targets become available. Do you maybe expect any more asset purchases? Just kind of wondering how you\u2019re thinking about all this. Andy Silvernail : I guess the only way I can answer that with confidence is the number of things that have come across the transom since we walked through the door here on January 1 is it\u2019s up substantially. So my answer to your question is \u2013 I think the answer is yes. Jeffrey Reive : All right. That should be all for me. Thanks. Andy Silvernail : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. Joe Giordano : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. Andy Silvernail : Hey, Joe. Joe Giordano : When I think about like your organic guide for 2018 and just think about how orders \u2013 and maybe let\u2019s focus on FMT and HST, just see if the lumpiness are diversified. But is it fair to think that maybe orders grow at a slower rate than revenues this year? I know the organic rate has been very solid on orders for you guys this year, but when I look sequentially, they don\u2019t look dramatically different quarter-to-quarter. It\u2019s a very stable, good, healthy run rate. Is that how we should be thinking about orders, kind of like stable around these areas, give or take a little bit on like a sequential pattern? Bill Grogan : Yes. I think the \u2013 sequentially, they will uptick slightly for our 5% number next year, but not materially. Andy Silvernail : Yes. And I think following \u2013 we\u2019ve always said that orders and sales quarter-to-quarter don\u2019t necessarily match with, obviously \u2013 within a year, they typically would. That\u2019s exactly what we saw this year. So you\u2019ll see some puts and takes. We\u2019ve built some backlog, which is a good sign, going into the first quarter. There\u2019s no doubt we\u2019ll have a quarter this year where we bleed some backlog, and no one should be surprised by that. Joe Giordano : Okay. So fairly, like you\u2019re getting a little bit of a tail from the order performance this year into revenue next year. That\u2019s fair. Andy Silvernail : Yes. Joe Giordano : Just quick housekeeping. On the corporate expense, it was bit higher than we had for the quarter here. Is that more of like a baseline that we should be modeling off of here, that kind of new $20-ish per quarter kind of level? Bill Grogan : No. We guided $17 million to $18 million for the first quarter. Andy Silvernail : [Indiscernible] Bill Grogan : Yes. I mean, the fourth quarter, again, we highlighted a little bit in our release, a lot of that was due to the increase in stock price impacting compensation and our overall management incentive. Based upon how we finished the year, there were some headwind from that. Andy Silvernail : Yes. Bill Grogan : Thanks guys. Andy Silvernail : Thanks, Joe. Operator : There are no further questions in the queue. I\u2019d like to hand the call back over to management for closing comments. Andy Silvernail : Great. So just kind of three closing comments, one on the lighter side and two on the more serious side. On the lighter side, I grew up in Maine, so I\u2019m a diehard in one of the Patriots stands, so I\u2019m now going to turn on the opportunity to say go, Pats, even though everybody here in Illinois hates me. On the more serious side, there was an announcement this morning that a gentleman by the name of Dan Comas is retiring from Danaher as their longtime CFO. And I was an intern for Dan in the summer of 1998, and Dan is just one of the true gentlemen, has built an incredible legacy. And I just \u2013 he\u2019s been around this community for an awful long time. He\u2019s a very special person, and I want to congratulate Dan myself on just what a great run and a legacy that he\u2019s built. And then finally, I just want to thank my teams. The teams here at IDEX have done a remarkable job. And we\u2019re trying to build a special enterprise, an enterprise that believes in our mission of trusted solutions and improving lives, people who have bought into the values in this organization and then finally, really focused on how do we do the right thing for all of our stakeholders, our shareholders, the folks who work here at IDEX and obviously, most importantly, for our customers. So I just want to thank everybody for the great work, and I look forward to an outstanding 2018. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

Before we begin, a brief reminder that this call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbor language in today\u2019s press release and in IDEX\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Andy Silvernail. Andy Silvernail : Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. I appreciate you joining us for our 2018 first quarter results. Let me start here with a brief overview. On the back of a record year, we continue to see broad-based strength in nearly every end market and continued economic improvements across the globe. I\u2019ll elaborate more on market conditions and geographies in a minute. Favorable markets, share gains and our execution drove another record quarter. We once again delivered all-time highs in orders, sales, operating income and EPS and most of the challenges experienced in HST in the back half of 2017 have subsided. We delivered organic revenue and order growth across all three segments in the first quarter. As a company, we achieved 11% reported and 7% organic order and revenue growth. Adjusted op margin was 22.6%, up 80 basis points and adjusted EPS of $1.29 was up $0.26 or 25%. Our efforts around segmentation continue to pay dividends and when combined with our targeted growth initiatives, we see a culture across the company that is even more customer and growth focused. Our balance sheet remains very healthy. Our gross debt leverage is 1.4x and our net debt is 0.7x. If you combine our strong balance sheet, capacity of our revolver plus free cash flow and cash balances across the globe, we have the ability to deploy over $1 billion in the next 12 months should the right opportunity present itself. Now, I\u2019d like to take a moment and talk about what we\u2019re seeing across our markets and across the regions we do business in. Our industrial markets are robust. Day rates of our book and bill business continue to improve and we saw more project activity in the quarter signaling a pickup in CapEx spending. If you turn to our Scientific Fluidics & Optics business, demand continues to be strong for IVD/BIO and DNA sequencing markets and show early indicators of continued growth throughout the year. NIH funding in the latest federal budget was up 8.3% alleviated initial concerns of a cutback. If you look at energy, midstream oil and gas markets continue to show signs of rebound and upstream energy continues to do very well. Semicon market continues to outperform with high global demand. The first quarter we finished 15% up year-over-year. In agriculture, you may recall that we ended the previous year with a very robust preseason orders. We saw some moderate slowing in the first quarter mainly due to long winter conditions but we still managed to finish up double digit in organic revenue growth. The municipal market in the U.S. has remained very solid and we continue to see opportunities with new product development in water and investment in emerging markets within fire and rescue to capitalize on demand. Now, let\u2019s move on to the geographic outlook. In short, the global economic outlook remains promising. The North American region continues to be positive for the vast majority of our categories. The European market is also robust with a stable political environment and all economic indices favorable for the first time in several years. Asia had accelerated with specific strength in China and in India. In summary, the growth we experienced in 2017 continued in the first quarter of 2018. And while talking about the global economy, let me talk for a second about the tariff question. Tariffs and the estimated impact have been on the top of many people\u2019s minds here including mine. Clearly, we have to wait and see where all this settles but at this point based on the enacted Section of the 232 tariffs on March 23rd, our best estimate is that there\u2019ll be somewhere around $2 million to $3 million of impact for the remainder of this year. This estimate excludes the Section 301 tariffs that have not been enacted. We\u2019re looking at all of our options including pricing and alternative sourcing strategies. We\u2019ll be very thoughtful about how we address these issues and we\u2019ll consider the impact on both of our customers and our shareholders going forward. I also want to comment on inflation. Our team did an excellent job in the quarter driving productivity to offset inflation. However, inflation remains a concern and we will continue to work on productivity and pricing to stay ahead of it. All right, let me turn now to capital deployment. Let me take a minute to recap our commitment to our capital deployment strategy. First, our M&A pipeline continues to be robust and as I\u2019ve mentioned previously our balance sheet positions us favorably to capitalize on the right opportunities. However, as we\u2019ve talked about many times in the past we\u2019ll be very disciplined in terms of capital deployment with a focus on delivering the best possible returns to our shareholders. In the meantime, we\u2019ll work diligently on integrating our latest acquisition thinXXS into the IDEX portfolio. In terms of organic growth, the team remains dedicated to our targeted organic growth and new product development initiatives. We saw the evidence of this in the quarter where we saw strength across all three segments. This makes five quarters in a row that we saw organic revenue growth and seven quarters in a row that we saw organic order growth. Although we did not repurchase any shares in the first quarter of 2018, we remain committed to opportunistically repurchasing shares and we expect to be back in the market in the second quarter. Finally, on dividends, on April 25th, our Board approved a $0.06 increase in our quarterly dividend or a 16% overall increase from $0.37 to $0.43. This puts us at the high end of our payout ratio of 30% to 35%. All right, let\u2019s turn now to the first quarter results. I\u2019m on Slide 4. Q1 orders of 632 million were up 11% overall and 7% organically. This was driven by strong organic order growth across all three segments; FMT was up 7, HST was up 8 and FSD was up 5. The strength in orders gives us confidence that the remainder of 2018 as some of the orders that we saw in Q1 won\u2019t convert to sales until the second half of the year. We\u2019ve had excellent success driving above market growth through segmentation and target growth initiatives and we expect this to continue. Revenue of 612 million was up 11% overall and 7% organically, driven by positive organic growth across all three segments. FMT was up 5, HST up 6 and FSD up 9. Importantly, we\u2019ve built $20 million of backlog during the quarter. The team continues to do an excellent job executing. Our flow through was 30% on sales in the quarter, excluding the impact of restructuring from both periods. And if you look at flow through, excluding impact of foreign currency, it was up even a more robust 38%. Gross margin was 45.2%, down 10 basis points from prior year mainly due to continued investments in engineering. Gross margin was up 70 basis points sequentially as the operational challenges within HST have subsided. Op margin adjusted for approximately 1.6 million of restructuring charges was up 22.6%, up 80 basis points year-over-year. The majority of the 1.6 million in restructuring was in HST and associated with our Optics Center of Excellence in Rochester, New York. Consolidated operating margin was also impacted by corporate costs being $3 million higher than the midpoint of our prior guidance. The increase in corporate costs is driven primarily by higher stock compensation, pension expense and outside consultants related to M&A and income taxes. Adjusted operating income of 138.3 million adjusted again for that 1.6 million of restructuring was up 15% compared to prior year. Q1 net income was $99 million resulting in EPS of $1.27. Excluding the impact of restructuring, adjusted EPS was $1.29 and increased $0.26 or 25% over last year. The $1.29 of adjusted EPS does include about $0.02 of pressure from a higher tax rate of 24% that compared to our ETR guidance of 22.5 and $0.04 of other income due to one-time FX transaction gains due to tax reform. We turn to free cash flow. That was one disappointment in the quarter. It was 62 million and converted at 62% of adjusted net income and was down 18% compared to prior year, primarily due to higher operating working capital. Sales in the month of March are $25 million higher than both December 2017 and February 2018 which drove the majority of the increase in receivables. Inventory also grew as we source additional raw materials to ensure we can meet customers\u2019 demands. All right, let me turn now to the segment discussion if you\u2019ll turn to Slide 5, I\u2019m going to start with Fluid & Metering. FMT continued to remain strong with both order and revenue growth. Q1 orders were up 9% overall, 7% organically. Sales were up 7% overall, 5% organically. Op margin adjusted for restructuring was 28.5%, up 110 basis points over last year. If you look at ag, it remains strong with double digit revenue increases year-over-year. On the industrial side, pumps had a very impressive quarter with double-digit increases in both orders and sales year-over-year. The increased oil prices have driven more business in the global oil and gas market as well as our LACT business. And importantly, our U.S. distribution market is solid and day rates for our book and ship continue to improve. In our industrial valves business, the highlight for the quarter was really in China where we saw a robust market. In water, it remains well positioned to grow via new products. And in energy, also a great new product story. We\u2019re seeing aviation show signs of recovery and the cold winter drove strong truck builds for the segment. Let\u2019s move on to Health & Science. I\u2019m on Slide 6. I was very pleased with the Health & Science first quarter. Q1 orders were up 14% overall, 8% organically. Revenues were up 11% overall, 6% organically. Excluding the impact of the restructuring expense, adjusted op margin was 23.9%, an increase of 120 basis points over the first quarter of last year mostly due to higher volume and productivity initiatives and it was 160 basis points sequentially as operational challenges that we discussed last year have subsided. The 23.9% operating margin is much closer to where I expect the segment to be performing overall and I\u2019m very pleased with how the team executed in the quarter. If we look at the Life Science & Optics business, again, IVD/BIO end markets remained strong. We saw some earlier than expected FDA approvals for our customers who drove favorability in the first quarter. And as I said, the integration of thinXXS is going quite well, very happy to have them on board. If you look at Sealing Solutions, the semiconductor market continues to be very strong globally as well as its transportation market. The Sealing Solutions group led the entire segment in terms of growth. MPT had a strong quarter with an improving funnel of opportunities and projects. And then finally in HST industrial, we saw nice growth across multiple markets and importantly we\u2019re seeing the distribution business within HST perform very well. I\u2019m on our last segment, Diversified, Slide 7. Orders were up 11% overall, 5% organically in the first quarter. Revenues were up 16% overall and up 9% organically. Excluding restructuring expenses, adjusted op margin was 24.9% which increased 110 basis points in the first quarter. In dispensing, the North American and the European markets remained strong with new products performing very well. Project activity in emerging markets is also positive. Looking at Fire & Safety, we saw rescue which is very positive across the globe and we\u2019ve seen project activity pick up in India, China and the Middle East. In the Fire business, we\u2019ve seen strength in OEM and the muni business which has remained pretty steady. And margin improvements for Akron Brass and AWG continue to be ahead of expectations. Finally on Band-IT, we had double-digit organic order and revenue growth in the quarter. We saw our share gains across global regions through new products and new program wins. And then finally, we are cautiously watching the impact of tariffs on Band-IT. Most of its supply chain is domestic but an increase in demand for U.S. produced alloys could have an impact. Let me now conclude with some additional details regarding our 2018 guidance for the second quarter and for the full year. I\u2019m on Slide 8. In Q2, we\u2019re estimating EPS to be $1.30 to $1.32 with organic revenue growth in the range of 5% to 6% and operating margin around 22.5%. The Q2 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 22.5% with an estimated 3% top line tailwind from FX based on the March 31st rates. Corporate costs for Q2 are expected to be about $20 million. If you turn to the full year 2018, we\u2019ve increased our full year guidance to $5.05 to $5.20. That\u2019s the new range. Full year organic revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 5% to 6% which is an increase from our previous guidance. Full year operating margin is expected to be in the range of 22.5% to 23%. We also expect to see about a 3% overall tailwind from FX based on the March 31st rates. The full year effective tax rate is expected to be 23%. But as the IRS continues to interpret tax reform, we could see some more variability in taxes throughout 2018. CapEx is anticipated to be around $50 million and free cash flow will remain strong at about 110% of net income. Finally, corporate costs are expected to be in the range of $73 million to $77 million for the year. This is a $3 million higher number compared to the guidance we\u2019d given before, all of it which occurred in the first quarter. Finally, our earnings guidance excludes any impact from associated costs or impact from acquisitions or restructuring in the quarter. With that, let me pause here. And operator, let me turn it over for questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Allison Poliniak : Hi, guys. Good morning. Andy Silvernail : Good morning, Allison. Allison Poliniak : So obviously really strong orders this quarter. Certainly there\u2019s been a lot of conversations as to whether '18 is peak and I know it\u2019s probably too soon to say that. But is there anything that you see in any of the businesses that gives you time to pause for concern here, any thoughts on that? Andy Silvernail : Allison, no. I think we saw strength throughout the quarter. We actually saw things pick up as the quarter went on which is not atypical of us. But there\u2019s nothing to indicate that things are slowing at this point. Allison Poliniak : That\u2019s great. And then Band-IT just going back to your comments on the alloys, are you in a position now from a pricing perspective that you feel that you\u2019d be able to pass that through at this point, or is that a risk out there right now? Andy Silvernail : Generally, I think we\u2019re pretty well positioned. We were pretty aggressive as we thought about coming into this year. If you remember, Allison, we talked a lot about inflation last year and a lot of our internal conversations have been about productivity and price and making sure we didn\u2019t get behind the curve. And I don\u2019t think we will in 2018. When I look at what we\u2019re seeing now, we\u2019re seeing behaviors that are showing things like extended lead times, people trying to jump to the front of the line, stuff like that. We\u2019re not seeing major changes in prices. What I would say, Allison, is that if what we\u2019re seeing today holds up, I believe you\u2019re going to start to see rising inflation here in the back half of the year and I think 2019 becomes significant if the economic conditions continue. And obviously we\u2019ve got our finger on this. It\u2019s absolutely probably \u2013 it\u2019s the biggest thing besides overall global growth rates that I think about in terms of what could hurt the overall story. And so as we think about productivity and when we think about pricing, we\u2019re committed to being ahead of the curve. Allison Poliniak : Perfect. Thank you. Andy Silvernail : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran from Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Mike Halloran : Good morning, everyone. Andy Silvernail : Good morning, Mike. Mike Halloran : So first one just on guidance, Andy, could you just talk a little bit about what\u2019s assumed in the revenue guidance from here? Is this pretty normal sequential from current levels, any kind of change in the direct trajectory assumes in guidance on the revenue side? Andy Silvernail : No, not really. If you look at it, what it assumes is that sequentially we basically kind of hold in here that we don\u2019t see acceleration necessarily from this point. And then the numbers just kind of fall in line based on comps, right. So we\u2019re not expecting things to get weaker from here. Last year had an abnormal pattern if you look at last year, because things were accelerating into the second half of the year. What we\u2019re expecting is that a more normal historical pattern and that business holds in terms of the overall book and bill rates, project activity. We don\u2019t see acceleration or deceleration. Mike Halloran : Makes sense. And then on the capital deployment side, a couple of quarters in a row now with elevated corporate expense related to some of the consulting costs for M&A actions. You\u2019re talking about a robust pipeline. Maybe talk a little about the actionability of the pipeline at this point? Are there more opportunities rising that you feel you can work on? We\u2019ve seen public market multiples start coming in. Is that happening on the private side at all? Any color there would be great. Andy Silvernail : Yes, so let me start there, Mike. So in terms of the private market multiples coming in, no, as a matter of fact I\u2019d say in the last two quarters. We\u2019ve seen behaviors that are what I would call unusual, meaning a lot of preemption, a lot of preempted bids. We\u2019ve had some folks who are out in the marketplace tell us that they\u2019re seeing 40% to 50% of deals being preempted at this stage at elevated prices. So we\u2019re being pretty careful around that. Now I do expect if you see multiples continue to compress a little bit in the public markets, that obviously will show itself in the private markets, no doubt about that. In terms of the other thing, in terms of actionability, we\u2019ve got some things that we\u2019re working on now that certainly fit into that category of actionable. And so it\u2019s a matter of whether or not we can cross the line. But which we\u2019re mostly seeing now are options. We\u2019re not seeing a lot of stuff that\u2019s private right now. So you know how that works out. We\u2019re going to work within our parameters that makes sense for us and for our shareholders and if we can get them across the line, but there are a few things that we\u2019re looking at and working on that I would definitely call actionable. Mike Halloran : Great. Thanks, Andy. Andy Silvernail : You bet, Mike. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Andy Silvernail : Good morning, Deane. Deane Dray : Andy, want to go back to your macro thoughts here a moment if we could. And just how would you describe the conversations with customers today? We were all wondering at the beginning of the year how much tax reform might change some of the buying behavior and willingness to spend. How much you\u2019re seeing is geosynchronous benefit versus IDEX-specific growth initiatives, like new product introductions? So kind of navigate us through the macro and then IDEX-specific. Andy Silvernail : Sure. So on the macro side, in terms of growth across the globe, this is as good as it\u2019s been in my time as CEO, right. So in the seven years that I\u2019ve been doing the job, it\u2019s as strong as it\u2019s been. So that\u2019s obviously positive. In terms of what\u2019s making that up, it\u2019s a good mix between the very short cycle book and turn business and improving CapEx. We\u2019re still \u2013 we don\u2019t really get involved in mega projects for the most part. But you are seeing the increase in things that are kind of a couple hundred thousand to say 5 million, you\u2019re seeing an improvement across the globe in those areas. And I think tax reform has played a role in that. Obviously cash flows meaningfully change for U.S.-based companies or those who pay taxes in the U.S. And so that\u2019s certainly a positive thing in that regard. In terms of IDEX, we track a handful or a couple handfuls or programs that we view as being differentiated growth for us. And as we track those, we still think where about half the benefits that we\u2019re seeing today come from the underlying markets, the strength in the underlying markets and about half we\u2019re getting ourselves. And so that\u2019s a good sign for us. And as you know, our goal has \u2013 we\u2019ve always said we want to be north of 200 basis points above underlying industrial production and the last numbers I\u2019ve seen suggest that we are very much doing that. And we\u2019re a lot less cyclical in a lot of the folks that you guys kind of compare us to and both on the up and the down. So when I look at the 7% organic numbers given kind of 2.6%, 2.7% industrial production, that feels like a pretty good number. Deane Dray : That\u2019s really good color. And when you say this is as good as it gets or as good as you\u2019ve seen. Andy Silvernail : As good as it\u2019s been, yes. Deane Dray : Yes, good as it\u2019s been, you\u2019re not saying that this is the high watermark. That was a phrase that spook the market last week. Andy Silvernail : Yes, there\u2019s nothing that suggest that. And you know me. On the scale of people, I tend to be a little bit more skeptical. And right now we are \u2013 when I combine what\u2019s happening across the globe and what\u2019s happening with IDEX specifically, the thing again that I worry about most is inflation getting overheated and then the global economy having to deal with that both in terms of just ability to supply and then what interest rates have to do on that back end. So when I think and obviously I can\u2019t control any of those expect to deal with what IDEX can deal with. But borrowing some kind of crazy geopolitical event that is the thing that I think we all should keep our eye on that would stop this growth. Deane Dray : Got it. And then just on company or business specific, can you address the water market, the municipal spending? And you commented in the slides talking about new product introductions. What was the contribution there? Andy Silvernail : Yes, if you\u2019re talking water specifically, the markets continue to be pretty good but let me break that into two pieces. So if you look at our ongoing services business and you look at our equipment businesses that we have that are tied to new product development, those are a good story. But the current U.S. administration has effectively stopped any kind of penalties that are coming in for as an example surge overflows. And so the amount how regulation is being interpreted and enforced is a net negative for that business. There\u2019s no doubt about it. And so the overall muni spending market is good because tax receipts are good. I would say the federal government in terms of enforcement is a negative. So I think it\u2019s just going to be kind of a steady single digit, call it low to mid-single digit here for the balance of the year. Deane Dray : Thank you. Andy Silvernail : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Nathan Jones : Good morning, everyone. Andy Silvernail : Hi, Nathan. Nathan Jones : Andy, I think over the last couple of years, you\u2019d talked about if we got organic growth up into this kind of level, you thought IDEX could do 40, perhaps even a little bit better in terms of incremental margins. I don\u2019t think probably when you were talking about that, you anticipated this kind of inflationary pressure that would come along with it. Can you talk about what, if at all, your expectations for incremental margins or how they\u2019ve changed in the face of this inflation? Andy Silvernail : Yes, if you recall, you go back and look at some of those comments, I think what I said was in the short term you could see that. So if you saw growth accelerate that you would see a pop just because the spending wouldn\u2019t keep up, right? So if you adjust for the FX impact, we were about 38 which is obviously not very far off from that number. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see \u2013 let\u2019s neutralize for FX for a second. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see high 30s incremental and the reason I say that is just the amount of investment that we\u2019re making specifically around engineering. And so we\u2019ve been pretty aggressive in terms of our engineering spend and pretty aggressive in terms of our CapEx. And so I think if we\u2019re in that 30% to 35% range on a consistent basis, I\u2019m really happy Nathan. Nathan Jones : I know you have always been of the opinion that it\u2019s easier to ramp up than it is to ramp down. Where is IDEX in terms of capacity to deal with this kind of demand in terms of maybe engineering or in terms of labor or even in terms of bricks and mortar if there\u2019s any need for additional square footage or anything like that in the next 12 to 24 months? Andy Silvernail : The square footage and I\u2019ll call it the machining capacity, those \u2013 and we have pockets here and there that we\u2019re making investments in but they\u2019re not big capital requirements around those things to allow us to meet demand. So if you think of just kind of square footage and machine capacity, we\u2019re in pretty good shape. The two issues that we face and everyone faces in the Western world certainly is around supply chain, so material availability and skill of labor. Those are the two areas that has the biggest constraints in the Western world. Obviously, the issue today around supply chain \u2013 what you\u2019re seeing is you\u2019re just seeing longer lead times and I think what we need to watch out for and what you guys need to watch out for is what happens in this environment as you start getting people with behaviors around things like double bookings where people start to order much more than they need which causes kind of a ramp \u2013 it ramps that cycle very, very aggressively. And then obviously the back side of that is ugly. And so I think all of us need to really have our finger on the pulse of is that happening. And you see it when you see spikiness in very specific markets. And so that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking out for. In terms of the skilled labor, look, there\u2019s nothing you can do in the short term about bringing on more skilled labor. That is a finite resource. The investments that are going into trade schools, the investments that are going to training programs will help ramp that at a minimal pace. What we have done is we\u2019re investing in more capable machining and what I\u2019ll call semi-automation. We\u2019re almost nowhere except for a few places are we heavily automated and we won\u2019t be because of the nature of the mix. But that\u2019s something we certainly are spending more time on. And by the way that\u2019s out of necessity and we would love to be able to hire more capable skilled labor, but that\u2019s a real bottleneck for us and for everybody. Nathan Jones : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks very much. Andy Silvernail : You bet, Nathan. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Scott Graham : Good morning, Andy. Andy Silvernail : Hi, Scott. Scott Graham : How you guys doing? Andy Silvernail : Good. Scott Graham : My question is really kind of 1 and 1a around price cost. What was your pricing in the quarter and what do you expect it to be for the year? Andy Silvernail : So we were between 0.5 point to a point for the quarter which was \u2013 we expect that to ramp actually as the year goes on. I think we\u2019ll end the year very close to a point. That would be my guess, assuming that we don\u2019t have to go out with more aggressive actions depending upon where inflation is. And as you know, Scott, very well that that\u2019s targeted in areas where we have that capability and generally we have pretty good pricing flexibility. So I expect that we\u2019ll be fine there. And so our goal has always been how do you neutralize inflation with productivity and let price flow through. When you get that, that is kind of the magic equation. We don\u2019t always get it but that\u2019s a great equation and that\u2019s what we\u2019re continuing to try to get this year. Scott Graham : Yes, understood. Bill Grogan : Scott, this is Bill. The only thing I\u2019d add is relative to the spread, we\u2019ve been able to maintain that spread. So as Andy said, we expect our price to ramp up as the balance of the year. We do expect inflation to increase. So our goal is to maintain that spread through the rest of 2018. Scott Graham : Okay. So on the pricing getting up to 1, are those from price increases that are in or still to come? Andy Silvernail : In. Scott Graham : Okay. And now if you were to maybe separate out productivity, do you think you were price cost neutral or was that a little negative for you this quarter? Andy Silvernail : No, it\u2019s positive. Bill Grogan : No, it was a positive spread. Scott Graham : That\u2019s all I had. Thanks. Andy Silvernail : All right. Thanks, Scott. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville from D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question. Matt Summerville : Thanks. Good morning. Andy Silvernail : Hi, Matt. Matt Summerville : A question on HST. A pretty nice breakout to the upside and operating profit margins. Can you talk a little bit more about what\u2019s driving that? You mentioned that you feel it\u2019s sustainable and I guess I want to look back a year or two to kind of what transpired in FMT and I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s a similar playbook, if you will, at hand here pertaining to HST? Andy Silvernail : So you got a handful of things that have happened in HST over the last few years that if you kind of follow the pattern going forward or follow that pattern here in the last few years. The first one is that the optics business we\u2019ve seen very, very significant improvement in profitability and growth rates in that business. And so that\u2019s been a big win for us. Second, as you know, we made a pretty substantial investment in our Sealing business in the U.S. and that was a drag for a couple of years as that got up to scale and \u2013 I don\u2019t know, Bill, that\u2019s going to be a big business here this year, isn\u2019t it? Bill Grogan : For basically 0 to 25 million. Andy Silvernail : Yes. And so that goes from kind of a negative to in line with the company fleet average in terms of margin over that period of time. And then you just get the benefits of volumes. HST, if you look at it across the segment has the same sort of variable margin component that you have throughout the company. And then finally as you know in the back half of last year and really kind of three quarters of last year, we kind of laid an egg there operationally. And we had several million dollars that we left on the table that\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m not going to say it\u2019s completely cleaned up now but it\u2019s not material. It\u2019s out of the way. And so that 23.9 is a good number. I feel good about that being sustainable assuming that the volumes hold up. Matt Summerville : That\u2019s all I had. Thanks, Andy. Andy Silvernail : Thanks, Matt. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Winoker from UBS. Please proceed with your question. Steven Winoker : Thanks. Good morning, Andy. Andy Silvernail : Hi, Steve. Steven Winoker : Look, you\u2019re obviously firing on all cylinders this quarter and you did mention the cash flow point. But could you go into a little more detail there around is it mostly just receivables and inventory on the demand front? And if so \u2013 you guys run pretty lean. Maybe talk about the initiatives there? Andy Silvernail : Yes, so it\u2019s all receivables and inventory if you scrub through the balance sheet, you\u2019ll see how that plays out. So as I mentioned in the call or in my prepared remarks, March was $25 million more than December and more than February. And so that receivables bullet [ph] that showed up here in March is just kind of nothing you can do about that. That\u2019s just reality. And on the inventory side, the most of that is about making sure that we\u2019re in a position to serve our customers. We did see a bit of a jump from year end that would not \u2013 you\u2019d prefer not to have seen but it did happen. And so when you put it altogether, that\u2019s the vast majority of the cash issue. I don\u2019t see it as being a problem as we go through the year. Steven Winoker : So you\u2019re able to hit your cash numbers for the full year. You expect this to catch up in 2Q? Andy Silvernail : I think it will be a little tighter. Bill Grogan : Our guidance, we did take it down slightly as I think the receivables I think will launch through the balance sheet but inventories, we\u2019ve stepped up again to put a little bit more safety stock within our supply chain to make sure we are able to meet customer requirements. I think inventory will bleed a little bit as we go through the year but there\u2019s inherent build that will remain at this current volume level. Andy Silvernail : But we\u2019ll be at that 110% plus of net income. Steven Winoker : Okay. And then just a longer term perspective, Andy, we\u2019ve talked about the IDEX business model for years. Without getting too carried away, is what you\u2019re seeing changing in any way the underlying growth profile for the company, the kind of drivers on the RD&E side, kind of how you see the complexity of the company, any of those things shifting as you\u2019re going through these exceptional quarters right now? Andy Silvernail : Steve, I think what I would say is I\u2019m becoming more confident of our ability to consistently deliver over markets. In the last year and a half we\u2019ve been able to demonstrate that in a rising market. And actually if you go back in time even when things were soft in '14 or '15 and '16, if you go back and actually look at our growth rates versus the peer group, we were above. So we\u2019re \u2013 I\u2019m going to say we\u2019re three years plus into delivering at that couple hundred basis points above our market growth. So my first I guess answer to you is my confidence level that we can more consistently do that is as high as it\u2019s been which is a huge plus for us, because as you know there is nothing like organic growth in our business. If you go and look at our \u2013 one of the things to really look at here is our return on invested capital. And if you go back and do that math and how we measure, we\u2019re up north of 15%. And barring any sort of M&A, we\u2019ll end up this year close to 16%. And if you go five or six years, it was down at 11. And that\u2019s what organic growth does for you right there. It\u2019s a huge driver to return on invested capital. And as you know, it\u2019s very defensible growth over time. So the segmentation we\u2019ve done, the investments around those segments and really on targeted growth I think have paid off and we\u2019re just going to continue to bet heavily on this model. Steven Winoker : Okay, fantastic. Thanks. Andy Silvernail : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jim Giannakouros from Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. Jim Giannakouros : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Andy Silvernail : Hi, Jim. Jim Giannakouros : Just a follow up on something that you gave us a heads up on a watch item, the accelerated restocking potential. Are you seeing that? Do you suspect that happening anywhere in any vertical or that\u2019s just \u2013 you were just classifying that as a watch item going forward? Andy Silvernail : Yes, Jim, I don\u2019t see it yet but if \u2013 obviously you got to back a really long time to see that. But this is where I go back and put on my investment analyst hat from 20-something-years ago, right, is in markets of acceleration and inflation, this is one of the behaviors that absolutely happens; the double ordering, the willingness to pay premiums to get in line. The biggest place that you\u2019re seeing problems today are around freight and logistics. If you look at freight and logistics that to me is it\u2019s very hard to get railcars, you\u2019re seeing lead times extending out for availability. So you\u2019re starting to see it there and of course the capacity is very much finite and easily measured. We all see the numbers. It\u2019s in the places where it\u2019s very hard to see around specialty components, specialty alloys, things like that where there aren\u2019t good metrics out there in the world where I think people could get caught flatfooted. And so we haven\u2019t seen it yet but we are really trying to watch intensely for it. Jim Giannakouros : Got it, okay. Thank you. And I believe you said that the corporate costs step up is isolated to 1Q events. I suspect that the surprise may have been on M&A spend. You mentioned the consultants. Was that \u2013 if I\u2019m right, is that a reflection of just you know what, kicking the tires and you accelerated some due diligence or deals that maybe fell through at the 11th hour? Andy Silvernail : I\u2019ll let Bill talk to it too, but that\u2019s played a role in it but we did spend more in understanding this new tax code. It\u2019s pretty clumsy as it is. As you know, they\u2019ve rolled it out with zero guidance. And so we\u2019ve had to expedite our understanding of that. And so I don\u2019t think we got a bunch of more costs, Bill, coming there. But stock comp wasn\u2019t small in the quarter. There were a number of items. Bill? Bill Grogan : Yes, I would just say the stock was up 8% so that was the primary driver of the increased corporate costs. And then as we continue to look at spaces within M&A and then tax reform obviously was the last piece Andy talked about. But I think a majority of it was related to stock comp. Jim Giannakouros : Okay. Thank you. And if I can sneak in one more, if I may. You guys obviously broad-based strength, we\u2019ve heard that now for several quarters. If you can give us any update \u2013 you used to call out percentage of revenues or certain areas that are not performing to standards either via top line growth initiatives or vis-\u00e0-vis your margin expectations. Is that happening still or are we at a 100% or is the rising tide lifting all boats, so to speak? Thanks. Andy Silvernail : You\u2019ve got some pockets there. The one that kind of stands out a little bit is if you look at our water business, we expect it to have overall stronger equipment sales but again the lack of enforcement has really whacked that. Now the service business is doing really well and the team is just exceptional. And so we\u2019re very happy with what they\u2019re dealing with. But I think the reality is that that\u2019s one interesting pocket on a couple of things. Bill Grogan : I guess fundamentally there\u2019s some timing and some price led issues like Andy mentioned, but as we go across the portfolio nothing sticks out. Andy Silvernail : Yes, there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s kind of really ugly. One of the real highlights in the quarter was our performance in China. I didn\u2019t really talk about that in the prepared remarks. But our China business was back to double-digit growth in the quarter and that has been soft here for a while as we had gone through and done our segmentation and our 8020 work in China that had been soft for a couple of years. And so it\u2019s nice to see that bounce back. Jim Giannakouros : Very helpful. Thank you. Andy Silvernail : Thanks, Jim. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Charles Brady from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question. Patrick Wu : Good morning, everyone. This is actually Patrick Wu standing in for Charlie. Thanks for taking my questions. Andy Silvernail : Hi, Patrick. Patrick Wu : Hi. It\u2019s nice to see dispensing within Diversified growing double digits in the quarter. Just going back to last quarter\u2019s commentary I think there was some talk about North America being a little more flat and then that\u2019s sort of coupled with some new products that were coming out at the end of the year. Can we just speak a little bit to dispending growth for this quarter? What\u2019s that really from? Is it mostly the positive dynamics of the market? Is it something that IDEX was doing specifically organically? Any color on that would be helpful. Bill Grogan : Patrick, I could take that one. I would say one thing if you recall last year dispensing\u2019s pacing of orders and sales shifted from first half to second half. So it\u2019s comping against an easier first half I think is one component. And then also the second thing is they did launch new products across the globe in each of their regions and those have been really successful at the start. So I think a combination of the new products introduction and then just timing of sales they way they\u2019re going to fall this year versus last year also plays a part. Andy Silvernail : And just to add, Patrick, I think if you look at our dispensing team, frankly they are the poster child for how we\u2019re trying to run IDEX more broadly. The team there has had incredible consistency and continuity. Their work around segmentation driving complexity out, reallocating resources to the places where we really have an advantage and we can accelerate growth and turning that into innovation, as Bill just talked about, you\u2019re looking at almost 100% refresh of their product line over the last two years. It\u2019s really impressive. And we are far and away the market share leader around the globe and these folks have positioned themselves very well to maintain that market share position and even take more share over time. Patrick Wu : Great. That\u2019s great color. Just on gross margins, obviously you guys spoke about the preliminary tariffs impact of like I think 2 million to 3 million coupling that with the pricing that you guys talked about in an earlier question. And I just want to pair it with last quarter\u2019s commentary regarding mid-45% in the medium term. Is that something that you guys are monitoring or something that you\u2019re still comfortable with moving ahead over the next, let\u2019s say, 12 to 18 months? Bill Grogan : Yes, I think our margin profile in the first quarter is what you should expect for the balance of the year, barring any significant macro changes. Patrick Wu : And that\u2019s inclusive now with the preliminary tariffs that you guys have talked about. Bill Grogan : Yes, correct. As we talked about earlier, we\u2019re ramping price to offset any of that to maintain our spread. Patrick Wu : Understood. Thank you. Andy Silvernail : Thanks, Patrick. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Brett Linzey : Hi. Good morning, all. Andy Silvernail : Hi, Brett. Brett Linzey : Andy, I just want to circle back to your comment on the CapEx pickup. You\u2019ve had a pretty good \u2013 pretty close to that pulse for a few quarters now. Could you maybe put a finer point on is it particularly markets or product lines that are really coloring those comments? And then are you seeing a broadening out of that capital light-type activity since just a few quarters ago? Andy Silvernail : Brett, it\u2019s really around a handful of our targeted growth initiatives. So we\u2019re seeing some meaningful parts if you look at the industrial base businesses where in our Viking business in particular which has had just an outstanding run here, we\u2019re going to put some more capital into that business which has been really important. And then we\u2019ve got, call it a couple dozen places that are pockets where we think can accelerate growth that we\u2019re putting capital. So I won\u2019t go through them one by one. But these are the kind of things that myself and Eric Ashleman and Bill are really spending our time hands on. Candidly, the biggest challenge that we have with CapEx is seeing lead times extend with equipment. So the lead time phenomenon that we\u2019ve talked about relative to supply chain is the same with equipment. So frankly I would have loved to have spent more in the quarter than we did and it\u2019s just constrained by our ability to get stuff. Brett Linzey : That\u2019s helpful. And I guess maybe more from a customer CapEx standpoint and more capital project work starting to break free a little bit. You made some comments in the prepared remarks. Just a little more color there? Andy Silvernail : You\u2019re definitely seeing it on the process industry side. And the process industry has now put that in oil and gas, chemicals, food, pharmaceutical. You\u2019re seeing more and larger pieces being released. Again, it\u2019s not huge for us but we\u2019re talking a couple hundred thousand to a few million dollars that you\u2019ll see in those. But if you go back 18 months, those are \u2013 we were just starting to see those things eke out and we\u2019re now seeing them accelerate. Brett Linzey : Okay, great. And then maybe just one more. Yet another very strong quarter on FMT margins and incremental, how sustainable is this type of operating leverage as we look into the balance of this year but 2019? Is there mix, is there other things driving that and I guess how do you view the margin entitlement in that business? Bill Grogan : So I think the profile within FMT in the first quarter should be pretty consistent as we march through the year. Again, if we\u2019re growing at mid-single digits, we\u2019re able to maintain or expand here in the balance of the year. Andy Silvernail : And if you recall, if you went back what would be a couple of years or so ago, 18 months or so ago, one of the things I said in our calls is I don\u2019t think people had realized that as the industry recession happened, right, we did something that was not particularly visible and that we held the margin profile of some of our really highly profitable businesses. And the performance that we generated was coming out of businesses that historically had not been as profitable as we fixed those. And what you\u2019ve seen happen now over the last 18 months is as volume has improved, you\u2019re seeing some of those higher profit contributor businesses accelerate. And so you\u2019re seeing \u2013 that\u2019s been a nice pick up and a nice change. And so I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s really going to be dictated on volume. So if volumes hold up, there\u2019s no reason why the FMT margins wouldn\u2019t hold up. But obviously we\u2019ll be more sensitive to volumes than other parts of the business. Brett Linzey : Got it, great. I appreciate it. Andy Silvernail : Thanks, Brett. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano from Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. Joe Giordano : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Andy Silvernail : You bet, Joe. Joe Giordano : Andy, your view on inflation getting a little bit more concerned and watchful over into next year, how has that changed businesses that you\u2019re looking at from an M&A standpoint? Are you thinking about those differently and how much you\u2019d like to pay for those or what the timing on something like that that might be more exposed to your views there? Andy Silvernail : We tend to not look at businesses that have huge amount of inflation \u2013 that have issues relative to inflation. So we\u2019re not looking at heavily cyclical businesses or that have a lot of direct inputs from base materials. And so we\u2019re looking at buying businesses that kind of look like us generally. And then if you look at how we value them, we value businesses looking over a very, very long period of time. And that\u2019s why I have been I think probably more skeptical than some on prices being paid where the conversation kind of just avoids the reality that a bunch of people are buying things at single digit ROIs over time. They may be NPV positive over years but you\u2019re looking at \u2013 people are literally buying things below the long-term cost of capital. And so I\u2019ve just been much more skeptical. And look, one of the beauties of our type of business is because the cash flows are so defensible, the ability to model those and to get comfortable with a pretty reliable range of value, we feel really good about being able to do that. And so frankly unless you think inflation is going to change over the next 20 years, unless you look at something really, really differently, it doesn\u2019t really change our point of view very much. Joe Giordano : Cool. Okay. And last for me, you mentioned on HST in the quarter you had some customers get early approval from the FDA. Was that kind of a pull-forward from your earlier plan or does that change the cadence of how you\u2019d expect to deliver revenue growth for the year? Andy Silvernail : I don\u2019t think it changes it much. Obviously, we\u2019ve baked in a little bit of increasing guidance on revenue there. This is stuff that we\u2019ve been talking about, gosh, for two years. It was just a matter of when those approvals would happen and they happened a little bit sooner than we thought. Bill Grogan : We got the order first quarter shippable starting in the back half of the year continuing into 2019. Andy Silvernail : A quarter or maybe two better than we thought? Bill Grogan : Yes. Andy Silvernail : So not material, Joe. Joe Giordano : Okay. Thanks, guys. Andy Silvernail : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brett Kearney with Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your question. Brett Kearney : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Andy Silvernail : You bet, Brett. Brett Kearney : Just want to ask what the roughly 1 billion of available firepower, if you will, to deploy over the next 12 months just on the acquisition front what size or size range you guys will be comfortable undertaking there? Andy Silvernail : For us anything that is 50 million to 500 million is \u2013 that\u2019s kind of right down the alley for us. So we\u2019d be super comfortable. There are some things that we look at and have looked at that are substantially bigger. And certainly we reserve the right to do that. But it\u2019s going to fit out model straight down the center. It\u2019s going to be the kind of businesses that we know and we love and we know how to run. And so there aren\u2019t very many of those out there in the world but there are a few, but for the most part 50 million to 500 million in enterprise value is what you should expect from us. Brett Kearney : Great. Thank you. Andy Silvernail : Thanks, Brett. Operator : There are no further questions in the queue. I\u2019d like to hand the call back to management for closing comments. Andy Silvernail : Thank you all for taking the time and most importantly thanks to our customers and to the people within IDEX who continue to execute just exceptionally well. I\u2019m very proud to be part of this team and I think we are running the business well and the people within IDEX really deserve that congratulations. So I appreciate your time being with us and look forward to talking to you here in 90 days. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode and a brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Bill Grogan. Thank you. Please go ahead. Bill Grogan : Thank you Brenda. Good morning everyone. This is Bill Grogan, Chief Financial Officer for IDEX Corporation. I am stepping in for Mike Yates this quarter. I will cover the introduction. Let me start by saying, thank you for joining us for our discussion on the IDEX second quarter financial highlights. Last night, we issued a press release outlining our company's financial and operating performance for the three months ending June 30, 2018 and later today we will file our 10-Q for the same period.

Joining me today is Andy Silvernail, our Chairman and CEO. The format of our call today is as follows. We will begin with Andy providing an overview and update on the market conditions, geographies and our capital deployment strategies. He will then discuss our second quarter financial results and walk you through the operating performance within each of our segments. And finally, we will wrap up with our outlook for the third quarter and full year 2018. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. If you should need to exit the call for any reason, you may access a complete replay beginning approximately two hours after the call concludes by dialing the toll-free number 877-660-6853 and entering conference ID 137675420, or you may simply log on to our company homepage for the webcast replay. Before we begin, a brief reminder. This call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbor language in today's press release and in IDEX's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Andy Silvernail. Andy Silvernail : Thank you Bill. Good morning everybody. I appreciate you joining us to discuss our second quarter results. Let me start with a brief overview. Look, we had another outstanding quarter. As a matter of fact, I would say in my seven years as CEO, it's the strongest overall quarter we have had and resulted in a very strong first half of the year. Just about every market that we have has shown solid growth and the economy we are in strong despite what we are seeing with global trade. I will provide more details on market conditions and geographies in a minute. Strong execution and continued healthy market conditions drove another record quarter for IDEX. After achieving all-time highs in orders, sales, operating income and EPS in the first quarter, we topped that this quarter and once again hit all-time highs in each of these categories. I am very pleased with our record second quarter and our first half operating results. I will go into more detail shortly, but let me give just a quick overview and some highlights here. Orders were up 9% overall, 8% organically. Sales were up 11%, up 9% organically. Adjusted operating margin was up 180 basis points to 23.6%. Adjusted EPS was $1.40, up $0.32, or 30%. And free cash flow was $110 million, up 40%. Of all the positive numbers in the quarterly results, I am most proud of the team's sustained outperformance on organic growth. The high single digit growth rates for both orders and sales driven by solid growth across all three segments is truly outstanding. Overall, we delivered terrific operating performance. Before I go through more specific details on financial results, let me add that I am excited that we just announced the acquisition of Finger Lakes Instrumentation, which will fill strategic gap and a nice complement in our IDEX health and science portfolio. I am also thrilled with the asset purchase of Phantom Controls that we made in June. These acquisitions will be a nice add to our portfolio. Finally, we continue to live the IDEX difference daily. Great teams embracing 8020 are driven by customer obsession. It's nice to watch a culture of the company embrace our initiatives and show up in our financial results. Now let me take a minute to talk about the markets that we play in and the regions we serve. In industrial, industrial production momentum continues. Day rates for our book and bill business remains at high levels and we see increased project activity converting to orders. In scientific, fluidics and optics, demand within life sciences remains positive and we continue to have a really, really nice performance overall. Energy, we have had a rebound in this market. Midstream oil and gas has picked up and upstream remains strong. In semicon, the global markets have remained strong, really all year and we look forward to that strength continuing. In agriculture, the markets continued to perform and the OEMs have affirmed the outlook for the balance of the year. We do have some concern here relative to trade but we will have to monitor that going forward. In the municipal markets, the markets remained strong. New product development in water has been a really nice benefit for us and emerging markets have done well. Now let's look at the geographies. Overall, things are going well for us in North America. Europe continues to be solid. And in Asia, in both China and India, we see things going very well. In summary, what we saw begin to experience in 2017 has accelerated in 2018. Once again, I would like to talk about for a minute with what we are seen with tariffs. Based on the enacted tariffs, our best estimate is that we are going to see $4 million to $6 million of impact in 2018. We continue to look at all of our options including pricing and alternative sourcing strategies and we have done a really nice job of overall balancing the overall margin impact to the business. Let me take a second and talk about inflation. We are starting to see the higher impact from inflation, but we have been very successful in mitigating the uptick through productivity and price realization. With that said, inflation remains a concern and the team is doing a very, very well, a very, very good job of monitoring this impact on a go forward basis. Let's turn to capital deployment. I would like to take a minute to recap our capital deployment strategy. As always, organic growth remains our number one focus and the team is dedicated to our overall targeted organic growth and new product development initiatives. This is evidenced by our outstanding organic order and revenue performance. With M&A, it remains a priority for us and we continue to evaluate a lot of opportunities. We are going to remain disciplined and focused on delivering the best possible returns to our shareholders. Our balance sheet is strong and when the right deals come along, we will capitalize on it. Speaking of the right deals, I am excited to welcome both been Phantom Controls and Finger Lakes to the family. The assets of Phantom Controls will match nicely with our current fire suppression business and help accelerate our waterflow strategy. And on Monday, we expanded our health and science portfolio by adding Finger Lakes Instrumentation. This will be a nice add to our overall fluidics and optical business. We will work to quickly integrate both of these acquisitions and bring them into the family in the short order. In terms of share repurchases, during the quarter, we deployed approximately the $20 million to repurchase 147,000 shares of stock. We remain committed to our strategy of repurchasing shares when it will create long-term shareholder value. In the second quarter, the Board approved a $0.06 increase in our quarterly dividend, which equated to a 16% increase. This resulted in a $33 million dividend payout to our shareholders in the quarter. All right. Let me turn now to our results here in the second quarter. I am on slide four. Q2 orders of $639 million were up 9% overall and 8% organically. Again, the strong order growth from all three segments, the strength in the first half orders provides us the confidence for the second half. Q2 revenue of $634 million was up 11% overall and 9% organically, driven by positive results in all three segments. FMT was up 10%, HST was up 8% and FSD was also up 8%. We built $5 million of backlog in the quarter on top of the $20 million that we built in the first quarter. We expanded Q2 gross margins by 50 basis points to 45.3%, primarily due to production efficiencies and volume leverage, partially offset by the investments in engineering. Q2 operating income was $149.8 million, adjusted for approximately $2 million of restructuring expenses. That was up 20% compared to the prior period. Q2 operating margin adjusted for the $2 million restructuring was 23.6%, up 180 basis points year-over-year. Similar to the first quarter, the majority of the restructuring expenses were within HST and are associated with our investment in the new optics center of excellence in Rochester, New York. Consolidated operate margin was also impacted by higher corporate costs, which was mainly due to $2.2 million stamp duty in Switzerland associated with the restructuring of an intercompany loan. Q2 net income was $107 million resulting in EPS of $1.38. Excluding the restructuring expenses, EPS was $1.40, an increase of $0.32, or 30% over last year. Our Q2 effective tax rate was 21.7%, which is lower than the 26.1% in the prior period. This was mainly due to the enactment of the 2017 tax reform at the end of last year. The 21.7% second quarter ETR was 80 basis points favorable to our previously guided amount. This was driven by continuous effort to modify our tax strategies and to the tax reform. The positive EPS impact of our lower ETR versus our guide was basically offset by the same tax I mentioned earlier. Overall, we had $0.09 operational beat versus the midpoint of our guide. Free cash flow was $110 million, 101% of adjusted net income and up over 40% from last year. And finally, flow through was another great story, over 40% of sales. In regards to our balance sheet, it's very healthy. We have gross debt of 1.4 times, net debt of 0.6 times and well over $1 billion in capital to deploy. Let me now turn to the segment discussion. I am on slide five, starting with fluid metering. FMT continues to put up strong numbers, both from an order and revenue perspective. Q2 orders were up 6% overall, 7% organically. Q2 sales up 10% overall and organically. Op margin adjusted for restructuring was 29.5%, up 240 basis points over the prior year, mainly due to volume leverage and productivity. The ag business, as I mentioned, continues to be strong and we are watching out for the impact of tariffs. In industrial fluids, the pump business is very impressive. It had record orders of sales. The U.S. distribution market is solid and day rates for book and ship continue to improve. Increased oil prices are driving continued strength in oil and gas as well as the business for our LACT. Valves, targeted growth initiatives in Europe and China have performed well in the quarter. And in water, we are well-positioned driven by new products. In energy, new product development is progressing and expected to provide future opportunities and the project funnel is solid for the back half of the year. Let's move on health and science. I am on slide six. I am very pleased with the health and science results in the quarter. Q2 revenues were up 11% overall, up 8% organically. Orders were up 5% overall, but only 2% organically. HST had a tough comp due to some very large project wins last year in MPT. Just to remember, HST orders last year were up 11%. Excluding restructuring expenses, adjusted operating margin was 23.6%, an increase of 100 basis points in the quarter mainly due to higher volume and productivity. As I stated on our last call, 23% to 24% operating margin is much closer to what I expect in the segment to be performing and I would like to commend the team once again for the improved performance. In life science and optics, the IVD/BIO end-markets continue to overperform. The recent acquisition of Finger Lakes Instrumentation will continue our expansion within this market. We are encouraged to add these technologies that Finger Lakes will bring and excited to bring them into our fluidics, microfluidics and optical illumination and detection business. In sealing solutions, the semicon market remains very robust on a global basis. Transportation and oil and gas are also doing well. In MPT, the funnel activity remains positive, but if you recall, we do have a pretty tough comp here in the third quarter in MPT. In HST industrial, demand remains overall very strong. I am now moving on to our final segment, diversified. I am on slide seven. Q2 orders were up 21% overall, 18% organically. Dispensing did have an easy comp as we had a large project last year push the second half. But even if we exclude that, orders would have been up double digits for the quarter. Revenues were up 11% overall, 8% organically. Excluding restructuring expenses, adjusted operating margin of 28.1% increased 300 basis points. This was mainly attributable to significant volume upside, along with productivity. In dispensing North American and European markets remained strong and steady with increased orders and project activity. Emerging markets remained strong from across market growth and new product development penetration. In fire and safety, rescue is positive across the globe and we have project activity pick up in India, China and the Middle East. And our fire OEM and Muni business is steady. As I mentioned earlier, we are very excited to incorporate the recently purchased assets of Phantom Controls. And finally, margins continued to improve at both Akron Brass and AWG. They are ahead of expectations. At Band-It, last but not least, we have experienced a double-digit organic order and revenue growth, driven by share gains and overall strong demand across the globe. Let me now conclude with some additional details to our 2018 guidance for the quarter and for the year. I am on slide eight. In Q3, we are estimating EPS in the range of the $1.29 to $1.32 with organic revenue growth in the range of 6% to 7% and operating margin of 23%. The Q3 effective tax rate is expected be approximately 22.5% with estimated less than 1% topline headwind from FX based on the June 30 rates. Corporate costs are expected to be approximately $20 million. Turning to full year. We have increased our full-year EPS guidance to a range of $5.27 to $5.35. Full-year organic revenue growth is expected be approximately 7%, so a nice increase in organic revenue guidance as well. If you remember, we have guided before at 5% to 6%. Full-year operating margin is expected to be in the range of 22.5% and 23%. For FX, it's going to be 1% tailwind for the year, based on the June 30 rates, but we will have headwind in the back half that is worth about $0.06 to us. The full-year effective tax rate is going to be about 23%, but we will see what happens here with tax reform. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be around $45 million. Free we cash flow will remain strong at 110% of net income and corporate costs should be in the range of $76 million to $80 million, that's up around a little more than $2 million from the stamp tax that I mentioned before. Finally, our earnings guidance excludes any associated cost of future acquisitions or restructuring. With that, Brenda, let me turn it over to any questions people have. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Steve Winoker with UBS. Steve Winoker : Hi. Thanks and good morning all. Great to see this level of growth and I agree, it's impressive. I would love to get a sense on that FSDP organic 18% increase on the order side. To what extent are these kind of one time, lumpy orders, pull-forward, anything else that we should be expecting to fall back to company mean rest of the year? I think you are up against high single comps. It wasn't easy there. Andy Silvernail : Yes. So overall, even if you take out some of the larger orders that we saw, looking at a double digit order increase, we did have some project orders that will ship in the back half of the year and even into the first part of next year. But the activity was very, very strong. I would not expect it to remain in the double-digit territory. That's too ambitious. But overall strength is pretty good. And it's in every one of the businesses. It's not in a singular business. Steve Winoker : All right. And your forward guidance implies, I think fourth quarter at least some deceleration. Again, you have 9% comp last year. Is that all it is? Is there something more to it? Is tariffs playing into your thinking here? Andy Silvernail : No. The tariffs, as we mentioned, is going to have some impact. Certainly into the cost structure of the business, we think about $4 million to $6 million. We haven't factored in a slowdown for overall global growth. We just have much tougher comps as we go forward. As I mentioned, last quarter, we have really started to see the acceleration at the back half of last year. And I don't think we are going to decelerate sequentially, but at the same time those comps just get tougher. Steve Winoker : Okay. And then just one more, if I could. These acquisitions, you mentioned, the most recent one sounds pretty interesting. Are the return on invested capital plan going forward changing significantly? How should we think about the financial side of them? And any kind of call out on the strategic front would be helpful. Andy Silvernail : The size is relatively immaterial today. Both of them are really technology plays, when you get right down to it. Phantom really helps us overall with the integration of being able to bring together all the most valuable components on a fire truck. It optimizes productivity for firefighters and safety. And the real benefit for us in Phantom is going to be pull through revenue from other parts of the business over time. It's a really neat set of technologies. It's very, very well protected with intellectual property. So we are very positive on that. Finger Lakes that we just announced, it's fundamentally a camera technology that allows us to integrate that into our optical systems. Right now, we are having to buy off-the-shelf componentry which, as things get smaller and more efficient, it gets more difficult to do. You really need to be able to integrate that yourself. And so it's a technology purchase that is right down the road from our current business in Rochester and it will go nicely into our center of excellence. Steve Winoker : Very helpful as always. Thanks and good luck. Andy Silvernail : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC. Please go ahead. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Andy Silvernail : Good morning. Deane Dray : Maybe we can start on price, cost in the quarter and then kind of separate both. So pricing, how much has pricing contributed? What's the plan on price increases? And then the other side, lots of material cost inflation, labor, how are you seeing that? And then the offsetting of tariffs? Andy Silvernail : Yes. So first on the pricing side, we got a little more than 1% in the quarter, which is a nice uptick from where we have been and that's really just our sustained strategies around the of being out and front of what we saw. Even last year, this time is a pickup in inflation. So we have been more aggressive there generally. And obviously the environment makes it easier to have those conversations with integrity with customers. The inflation has also picked up. We have kept our spread. We said, we have historically shot at somewhere over 20 to 30 point spread on price versus inflation and we have kept that. And so, we are seeing inflation pickup and it's really everywhere. It's material. It's labor. It's universal. And we expect that to continue. And obviously tariffs don't help that situation. We are having those conversations with our customers who try to, again, be ahead of everything. What you don't to be is the 20th person in line having that conversation about how tariffs have impacted the business. I think the threat and I have been talking about my concerns about inflation for a while. The threat is that, in the short-term the tariffs cause are really kind of gasoline on the inflation fire. In the long term, it's the flip side. It's actually causes the deceleration in growth. But in the short-term, we could see that impact. And we are balancing that with a combination of actual price increases and then in some cases, what I would call surcharges, where they will roll back off if tariffs roll back off. And those are broken down about 50-50. Deane Dray : Good. That's real helpful. And then maybe just on the pricing side, we have heard some descriptions from CEOs about pricing effectiveness and what is that dialogue because you are at the higher end of the component technology and you have got more pricing power. So when you put pricing through, are you getting pushed back? Are you getting all the price? Just some color there would be helpful. Andy Silvernail : You never get all of it. I think realization is probably somewhere in the 50% range over time of what you go to the market with and what effectively sticks. And it's easier to have those discussions in distribution than it is with, obviously if you have long-term OEM contracts, that's a much more difficult conversation to have. And so, we will typically get more price in, if we are looking at FMT and diversified and we will get less price overall in HST. Deane Dray : Got it. And just last question on the outlook and kind of a follow-on to Steve's question is, when you look at the key barometers and we have talked about this before, whether it is Gast and Band-It and Warren Rupp, just maybe just take those kind of leading indicator businesses and what do they tell you about the pace of short cycle industrial demand and how long this demand growth is sustained? Andy Silvernail : They are very positive If you look at our industrial businesses, our industrial fluids businesses, they are the strongest of our businesses overall. So they are signaling very positive things. We don't have any signs that that necessarily is going to slow. I am obviously very hesitant with what the overall trade discussion means to the global economy. And look, if things start to slip, they will show up fast in those businesses. Gast and Warren Rupp, in particular, Band-It, industrial, you will see that relatively quickly if the global economy starts to slow. Deane Dray : That's real helpful. Thank you. Andy Silvernail : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Allison Poliniak : Hi guys. Good morning. Good morning. Allison Poliniak : Can you just talk to, I guess, capacity, both from the supplier side and your side? With growth at this level, any concerns that your suppliers won't be able to keep up, that you are going to have to adjust for it that you have been adjusting for? Andy Silvernail : Yes, it's real, Allison. So let me talk about it from our perspective first. From our perspective, we really don't have a lot of physical constraints. If you look at buildings, machinery, you don't have a ton. We are definitely increasing our overall automation or semi-automation. We are doing that mostly through machining centers. And so, we are not really constrained in that way. The biggest constraints for us and for everybody is people, highly skilled people and that's going to continue and that's going to get more difficult as time goes on. And I do think that that's what's going to drive across the globe more investment in automation and semi-automation. In terms of our supply chain, we absolutely are seeing issues and we have been for some time. If you look at lead times, they have extended. As we talked about last quarter, we built some inventory last quarter, because we had seen lead times extend and we were trying to protect our customers, I think we have generally done a pretty good job of that. But there is really no way to avoid it in this environment. And that's why I think we are starting to see the capital cycle play out the way it is because you are seeing some constraints in global supply chain. Allison Poliniak : That's great. And then I just want to touch on the full-year margin outlook. You are still keeping to that low-end of the range. Is there something mix-related that we should be thinking about in the back half that could bring that number down a little bit from what you did in Q2? Bill Grogan : No. I mean when you look at our first quarter margin rate and second quarter, the average there is a little bit over 22.5%. So no major mix concern. I think we will probably be closer to the top of that range. But we wanted to give ourselves a little bit of spread, depending where things go in the back half. Allison Poliniak : Perfect. Thank you. Andy Silvernail : You bet, Allison. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones of Stifel. Please go ahead. Nathan Jones : Good morning everyone. Andy Silvernail : Hi Nathan. Nathan Jones : I guess, Andy, you guys have always been prepared for the worst and hope for the best kind of company in the way you run the businesses over there. With growth coming in pretty significantly higher than you had planned at the start of the year, are you seeing any need to add kind of back office support functions, G&A kind of functions, corporate expense kind of functions back into the business to support this higher level of growth? And then maybe how you are thinking about that with your opinion that may be tariff slowdown growth, level of growth, may be the growth doesn't stay as high as it has been that long? Andy Silvernail : So we have very cautiously added, what I would call, overhead to the business. If you look at our overall headcount across the globe, it's only modestly changed in the last couple of years. And so we have got a lot of productivity there. Where we are going to add people, where we have added people are at the businesses. There is really no need to add a bunch of people at corporate. As you know, it's a pretty small group anyway. It's pretty much IT, finance and HR. Otherwise, everything is at the businesses. And so that's where we are going to focus our investment. I don't really see a big need for that to change. The one thing that I talked to a lot with people about is, unlike five years ago or 10 years ago, where there was a lot of fat to trim in the downturn, that doesn't exist today. And so in the next downturn, which will come, us and everybody else are going to have to be very, very smart about how we deal with that and in terms of people in particular, right. So the people shortage that exists across the globe of really of skilled folks is going to get exacerbated here, it's not going to get better. And so when you think about a downturn, you are going to approach it differently thank you have approached in the past and you are going to do everything you can to actually be ahead of the curve and make sure that you don't hurt your great people. Nathan Jones : Fair enough. And then, I know you guys have largely or pretty much exclusively funded all of the internal growth opportunities that warrant funding, you have got high growth here, you have got more income here. Are there other projects that you can you go a little further down the list for, that potential don't have as good a returns, but still good returns that you would look at funding? Do you have enough bandwidth, enough people power to continue to do that? Andy Silvernail : I have said this many times, I feel very confident that we are funding the things that are in front of us that makes sense. If there is a limitation, again it's people, right. I don't think it's a big limitation for us, but that's the biggest thing across any of our businesses. Great people make a huge difference. And that's why we spend so much time on it as a corporation. Nathan Jones : And then maybe just one more following up on Allison's on the supply chain. You are talking about seeing lead times stretch out targeting the supply chain. Are you starting to say suppliers look to cash in on that and raise prices contributing to inflation? Is that something that you are expecting to see? Are you expecting it to get worse? Any color you have got there? Andy Silvernail : We have absolutely seen it. We work at it constantly, both in mitigating with our supply base and diversifying across suppliers and passing on price where we need to, it's there, right. So if you went back two years ago, pricing into our supply chain was effectively zero, right. It was nothing and we were getting positive productivity. Today, we are in the eight-tenths of a point range that we are starting to see. And so that's a meaningful uptick across our businesses and there is really, at this stage where we are seeing demand continue to be strong, there is no reason that's going to change unless our leadership shoots us all in the foot here. Nathan Jones : Okay. Thanks very much for your time. Andy Silvernail : Yes. Operator : Our next question is going to come from the line of Brett Linzey with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Brett Linzey : Hi. Good morning all. Andy Silvernail : Hi Brett. Brett Linzey : Hi. I just wanted to come back to FMT margins. They really continue to impress here with further expansion in Q2. I guess, with H1 and H2 sales relatively balanced, is there anything in the back half in terms of mix or stepped up investment that would suggest or point to profit margins stepping down sequentially H1 versus H2? And then I guess, what's the expectation for that segment for the full-year? Andy Silvernail : Bill? Bill Grogan : Within FMT, there is some seasonality where sequentially the revenue will go down a little bit here in the back half. Example, Banjo seasonality, they are more first half related and they are one of our highest margin businesses. So it's not a huge impact, but you will probably see the margins not be as robust as they were in the second quarter, but still within that mid to upper 28% range. Andy Silvernail : I mean just across the board, one of the major drivers of profitability for us has been the strength of a handful of industrial businesses that have superior contribution margins to the rest of the company and have pricing power. And so, we are very mindful about that. And so as you look at sequential changes that flow-through is big, positive or negative. And so you certainly have to watch that quarter-to-quarter. Brett Linzey : Okay. And then in the release, you talked about the M&A pipeline being active. I guess how would you delineate between what's actionable at current valuations and returns versus relationships that are just being cultivated? You see anything breaking for you here in the near-term? Andy Silvernail : We have been awfully close on some things. Just recently, we walked away from almost a $0.5 billion deal and we walked away on price. We got down to the last couple of players and we walked away just with the discipline that we brought to bear. So it certainly isn't a lack of opportunities. It isn't a lack of effort. It really is the pricing environment. And so we have been very disciplined. We will continue to be disciplined. The stuff we are cultivating, that really doesn't change quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year. That magnitude looks the same. It really was driven by what's come into market and we have seen a lot of activity this year come to market and we expect that to continue with these elevated valuations. Brett Linzey : Okay. And just maybe one more on our new product vitality. You guys have taken share here for a couple of years on orders and sales. What percent of sales are from new products over the last three years today? And I guess, what's the right number? As you guys climb the technology curve in many of these businesses, where does that target need to be? Andy Silvernail : Brett, we stopped measuring new product vitality some time ago and the reason for that is what I found is, it tends not to be a real number. It's not something that's easily auditable and it also creates a lot of bad incentives for people to rename things to increase complexity and stuff like that. So we tend not to do that. The other thing is and really the beauty of IDEX is, we tend to have very, very long product life cycles, things that last decades and have incredible durability. And so we don't want to shoot ourselves by accelerating change that doesn't need to be changed. That being said, we are really aggressive around new product development. And if you look at the growth that we are having, the 9% organic growth, over half of that is the market and about half of it we are driving. And I would argue that that most of that is coming from new product development. Brett Linzey : Okay. Makes sense. Great. I will pass it along. Thanks. Andy Silvernail : Thanks. Operator : Our next question is going to come from the line of Joe Giordano - Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Joe Giordano : Hi guys. Good morning. Andy Silvernail : Good morning Joe. Joe Giordano : So most of my stuff has been asked already. But Andy, I just wanted, you are a pretty conservative guy and you generally like the last, God knows how long now, you guys come in above the high-end of what you are guiding pretty consistently, but this quarter the magnitude of that was even more than it has been. What were the couple things that, obviously you are not trying to get like top ticket with your guidance, but what were the couple things that were, wow, this is a lot better than what we kind of thought? Andy Silvernail : So you come into the quarter with about 50% of the quarter book and I don't know, Bill, what's that changed by? A couple of points here and there? Bill Grogan : Yes. Andy Silvernail : It doesn't change by a lot. So what happens in the quarter is you get more book and turn business. And that really happened and it happened across that the business. It wasn't one or two businesses that drove it. It really was across the portfolio. And so the overall economy, my expectation was that you were not going to see a sequential acceleration in the second quarter. I thought that would start to modulate and we did see it. And so that did surprise us a little bit. So a stronger book and turn business, strength sequentially that we hadn't really expected and I do think that that does slowdown, right. We have now had what, six or seven quarters of sequential acceleration? Bill Grogan : Yes, six. Andy Silvernail : Yes. So that's going to slowdown. There is no doubt about it. And I think we were probably a quarter or two early in making that call. Bill Grogan : Yes. I mean the stat we look at internally, 60% of our businesses were up double digits. So that's pretty broad-based across the external segments to have that magnitude of growth across the portfolio. Joe Giordano : So it's fair to say, you are not extrapolating that king of acceleration into your updated guidance then? Andy Silvernail : The third quarter is going to be stronger than we thought before, but we don't see it accelerating from the second quarter like we saw with the second quarter accelerate from the first. Seasonally that tends to be a weaker quarter for us anyway. And I just don't think that the growth is going to accelerate. I don't suspect it's going to get weaker unless again, it's driven by some of the overall trade issues and whatnot. But I still think it's going to be pretty robust. Bill Grogan : Yes. So relative to our last guide, we are more confident in the back half in what the growth numbers are going to be. Joe Giordano : Okay. And the last for me, just on the diversified segment on the margin. That segment is so hard to model, just given the size of orders. Like what's real, what should we be thinking for the second half there? Bill Grogan : I think 26% or 27%. At the current growth rate, it's been able to lever extremely well and with the two acquisitions that Andy mentioned earlier, the progress we have made on the integration front, they have well surpassed our expectations. So they are going to much more close to where they were pr-deal. Joe Giordano : Thanks guys. Andy Silvernail : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with BMO. Scott Graham : Hi. Good morning. Can you hear me? Andy Silvernail : Hi Scott. Scott Graham : I am hearing some interesting questions here, kind of like I am going to ask a similar on kind of how you guys are doing it? The organic continues to shine through and somehow even got better. So I guess my simple question is, from my simple mind is, are you willing to maybe share a little of that secret sauce here, Andy? Can you tell us where the sales opportunities are most prevalent and which ones you are funding, maybe by segment? Can you maybe get a little bit more specific on how you are doing this market share, this land grab so consistently? Maybe you can give us a little more detail if possible? Andy Silvernail : I will give you a relatively boring answer. If you actually look back, this is kind of three years in the making, if I go back. We got really aggressive, go back to 2014 and 2015. We got very, very aggressive about segmenting our businesses. And so as you think about what we have done with using the 8020 principles around segmenting our businesses, segmenting our markets and really deeply understanding where the profit pools were, where we had advantage, where we didn't have advantage and really aggressively moving resources around the company. I had mentioned earlier that we haven't seen a big change in headcount here in quite some time and the reason for that is because, over three or four years, we have really aggressively moved people and investment to the areas within businesses and I am talking about segmenting to the product level where you are moving people and resources to where we have distinctive advantage. And so I will give a great example of that. If you look at our dispensing business, if you went back six or seven years ago, we had real question marks about that business, about the viability of that business and whether or not it should be in the portfolio. And if you look what Eric Ashleman and the team have done, Eric's our Chief Operating Officer, we have fundamentally refreshed that entire product line. We exited a handful of product lines really aggressively. We entered at a previously nonexistent market segment with the X-Smart and have, as I said, refreshed the entire product category and dispensing has turned into just an outstanding business for us. That same example can be used across the across IDEX. You can go business by business. We opted to sell six businesses. As you know, we had been reticent to sell anything in the past and we got out of businesses that we didn't think we had an advantage with. We exited four, Bill, I want to say, three, four years in a row about a point of organic growth each year? Bill Grogan : Yes. Andy Silvernail : That didn't really show up in the numbers, per se, because we didn't talk about it a ton. But if you are talking about it over a period of time, more than $100 million, actually probably more like $150 million, if you include what we got out of in optics that we exited. And we exited businesses where we didn't have an advantage, a distinct advantage. And so it's a relatively boring answer. It's a lot of very scrappy, in the dirt work. And in our business, things move relatively slowly. And I think, what you are seeing now is you are seeing that hard work pay itself off. Scott Graham : Okay. That was comprehensive. Thank you. Would it be possible for me to ask you sort of if you gave us a dispensing example, can you give us an example, maybe in pumps? Andy Silvernail : Oh, sure. Let's us Viking, it's a great example. The Viking business has always been a flagship business for us. And what I would say is, we had a distinctive culture where we said yes to everything. So you had unbelievable modifications that we were doing that in that plant. We had lead times that were ridiculous. We really relied on the Viking brand. Our volumes were modestly growing at best for five, six, seven years and that exact playbook that I walked you through a moment ago, in the last three years of Viking, we have done the exact same thing. And even if you take away the incredible strength in the markets that they are in, Viking is doubling their market growth rates right now. The LACT business has been outstanding. We ventured multiple segments of that market with technologies that have a really distinctive advantage versus the competition. Our overall lead times, we have cut them in half in three years. And so our ability to be incredibly aggressive in the marketplace on service is unique. And when you are in an environment like this, lead times really matter. And so we have been able to do those sorts of things at Viking. So you could go across the business. I can give you examples of that in HST. I can give you examples of that at Gast. You can do a business by business and that's the key, right. There is IDEX magic here, right. Except to say, we have done this across our portfolio of 40 businesses and we have made a really tough capital and people allocation decisions around where we have distinctive advantage. Scott Graham : Got it. Thanks a lot. Great quarter. Andy Silvernail : Thank you Scott. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Walter Liptak with Seaport Global. Walter Liptak : Hi. Thanks. Good morning and I will say, congratulations on the organic growth too, especially the consistency. Andy Silvernail : Thank you Walt. Walter Liptak : I wanted to ask just a clarification on a data point. When you are talking about market share versus market growth, I thought I heard you say that you attribute half the growth to market share, the other half to the market. Is that right? Andy Silvernail : Yes. And I would use, market share is not exactly the right term, because in some places we are literally entering businesses that we haven't been in. So you could you could call it share, but it's half market growth and it's half new business that we are winning distinctively. Walter Liptak : Okay. All right. Got it. And realizing that a lot of your business is quick turn and there is low visibility,, there is some project work and I wondered if you could talk a little bit about what you are seeing projects? Is there a funnel that's building? Maybe pricing? And then specifically, I think you called out the LPG truck build. Where are we in that cycle? Is this something that, why and how long does that go? Andy Silvernail : Well, let me make sure I got this. So you have a question on project work generally, pricing and then LPG. So let me make sure I get all three of those. Walter Liptak : Yes. Okay. All right. Thank you. Andy Silvernail : On project work, yes, it's picked up. As you know, we don't tend to have a lot of really large projects. They tend to be in the $200,000 to $5 million range generally. And if you went back 18 or 24 months, what you would have heard is say is that we were really living on book and turn business. And we start to see project work come back 18 months, 24 months ago and that has continued to improve. So that has absolutely been the big change here. If you look over the last couple of years, where project work has come back, we have certainly seen that. In terms of pricing, Walt, I am not exactly sure what your angle was on pricing. Can you clarify that for me? What was the question? Walter Liptak : Just sometimes the longer project work goes out to bid, there is some multiple rounds of bidding to try and get the price down? Andy Silvernail : Okay. That certainly is the case. We tend to be a really small part of these projects. And so we don't tend to see a lot of price pressure in there. That's not something that would be particularly mentionable here. So I would say, no, it's not been a particularly big deal. And the overall pricing environment for anything right now is much more favorable than it has been in a long time. And then finally on LPG, yes, the truck builds have improved. Where are we in the cycle? I think we are actually still early to mid stage in that. That really just picked up this year, if you look at it. Now truck builds overall, as you know are astronomical. I think the U.S. is at 430,000 Class VIII trucks, if I remember right. It's a big number. And obviously, we are not as tied to that, but overall that industry is seeing major expansion. But I would say, we are still early to mid on the LPG truck build. Walter Liptak : Okay. Great. Thank you. Andy Silvernail : You bet, Walt. Operator : Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing comments. Andy Silvernail : Well, first, just thank you for following IDEX and the work that you do here with us. Most importantly, I really want to thank our teams. The operating teams in the business, led by Eric Ashleman, have just been outstanding. The results that we get is due to them. And I am very, very appreciative of what they bring to the table each and every day. So again, I appreciate your time and look forward to talking to you here in 90 days. Take care. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And thank you for your participation.",

LLC Operator : Greetings and welcome to the Third Quarter 2018 IDEX Corporation Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mike Yates, Chief Accounting Officer. You may begin. Michael J. Yates - IDEX Corp.: Thank you, Sherry. Good morning, everyone. This is Mike Yates, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for IDEX Corporation. Let me start by saying thank you for joining our discussion of the IDEX third quarter financial highlights. Last night, we issued a press release outlining our company's financial and operating performance for the three months ending September 30, 2018; and later today, we will file our 10-Q.

Before we begin, a brief reminder, today's call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the Safe Harbor language in last night's press release and in IDEX's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I'll turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Andy Silvernail. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everybody. I appreciate you joining us here to discuss our 2018 third quarter results. Let me start with a brief summary of some key results and also our guidance. And I think as we go through the call today and questions later on, these are the points that I think really matter. Overall, the organic landscape of our business remains very positive. Our targeted growth investments continue to pay off. The economics of our end markets are fundamentally strong and we continue to see growth across all geographies. Our balance sheet is strong and we have ample dry powder to play across our framework to drive long-term value for shareholders. Tariffs and inflation are ramping. Our teams have been able to offset the headwinds through pricing actions and productivity to remain ahead of the inbound pressure. Finally, our effective tax rate for the third and the fourth quarters have been more variable than normal. In the third quarter, we had favorability in our rate due to excess tax benefit related to stock compensation that drove $0.04 EPSB (00:03:24) versus our guide. In the fourth quarter, we have approximately $0.07 of EPS pressure in our guide to revise assumptions impacted by a repatriation of a tax estimate associated with tax reform. However, our full-year ETR is still expected to be 23%, which is in line with our guidance. At the end of the day, we exceeded our Q3 performance and we're raising our full-year guidance. All right, onto the quarter. We had great execution by our team, along with healthy market conditions, which drove another quarter of outstanding results for IDEX. We, once again, achieved high-single-digit organic growth rates for both orders and sales and we outperformed our markets. I continue to be very pleased with our results and here are some highlights. Orders were up 7% overall, 8% organically. Sales were up 8% overall, 9% organically. Adjusted op margin was 200 basis points up, is 24% for the quarter. Adjusted EPS was $1.41, which was another record, up $0.33 or 31%. The $1.41 is $0.10 higher than the midpoint of our previous guidance, and I'll walk you through some details of that shortly. Free cash flow was $114 million, 104% of adjusted net income, it was impacted by a couple items that I'll talk about here in a minute. Continuing the momentum we had in the first half, our Q3 operating results were strong across the board. Our targeted growth efforts continue to pay dividends, we're driving high-single-digit growth rates in orders and sales across our business. Finally, the IDEX difference continues to be the catalyst behind our results. Great teams, focused on critical few initiatives in their businesses that are driven by our customers. We see example after example throughout our units, it's what separates us from the competition and allows us to deliver for our employees and for our shareholders. Now, I'd like to take a minute and just walk you through what we're seeing in the markets we serve and the regions we do business in. The industrial markets conditions continue to be favorable, day rates for our book and ship businesses continue at high levels, project activity is strong, and the funnel remains full. In Scientific Fluidics & Optics, our life science market remains healthy, our teams continue to drive expansion in IVD/Bio and DNA sequencing through customer intimacy and innovation. The Energy market has rebounded with oil prices rising and stabilizing, we're seeing project activity across liquid petroleum gas, refined fuels and commercial aviation. In Municipal, the North American market is stable, our focus remains on new product development in Water and investments in emerging markets within fire and rescue to drive growth. If we turn to a geographic outlook, the bottom line is that sales across all geographies have performed well in the quarter, with healthy underlying economic conditions and our targeted growth initiatives we've grown across the globe. However, we are keeping our eye close on several factors that could impact the overall growth environment. As we look at tariffs, our best estimate for the impact to IDEX is approximately $2 million for the remainder of 2018. We'll offset the impact, but we continue to monitor the potential future ramifications as we get deeper into global trade uncertainty. Inflation remains a concern and continues to have an impact. We've been successful in mitigating inflation through productivity and price realization. With that said, we keep an eye on any aggressive actions from central banks that could negatively affect the current growth trajectory. These two items are real risk for the overall economy and IDEX. Regardless of the external environment, which we expect to remain volatile, we are committed to outperform our markets. Before I turn to the quarterly results, just a quick comment on M&A. Overall, it remains a top focus for us, but remains challenged due to the environment that we're in with valuations. Our teams are hard at work at both cultivation and evaluation of several deals, but we're going to remain disciplined and we're only going to do deals that fit into our criteria. Our focus has and always will be to deliver the best possible returns to our shareholders. Our balance sheet is very strong, and when the right deal comes along, we'll capitalize on it. Okay. Let's turn to third quarter results, I'm on slide 4. Q3 revenues were $623 million, up 8% overall, 9% organically, driven by outperformance in all three segments. We expanded gross margin by 10 basis points to 45%, primarily due to production efficiencies and volume leverage which is partially offset by investments in engineering related to new product development. Adjusted op margin was up to 24%, up 200 basis points over last year. Q3 net income was $106 million, resulting in EPS of $1.37. If you exclude restructuring, adjusted EPS was $1.41, up $0.33 or 31% over last year. Our Q3 effective tax rate was 20.2%, which is lower than the 26.4% last year, mainly due to the enactment of 2017 tax reform at the end of last year and higher excess tax benefit from stock options in the period. The third quarter ETR of 20.2% was 280 basis points lower than our previously guided amount. It accounted for $0.04 out of the $0.10 of EPS favorability compared to the midpoint of our guidance. The remaining $0.06 of EPS favorability was driven by operations. Free cash flow was a solid $114 million, 104% of adjusted net income and it was impacted by two items. First, we invested $19 million in CapEx primarily for growth; and second, we made a discretionary $10 million contribution to our defined benefit pension plan to take advantage of accelerated deductions. In regards to the balance sheet, it remains very healthy. Gross debt leverage is 1.3 times and net debt leverage is 0.5 times. The combination of a strong balance sheet, capacity of our revolver and free cash flow have us in a position to deploy well over $1.5 billion in the next 12 months if we're able to. All right. Let's turn to the segment discussions, I'm on slide 5, and we'll start with FMT. Look, Fluid & Metering had really strong numbers in the quarter, for both orders and revenue. Orders were up 9% overall, 12% organically. Sales were up 8%, also up 12% organically. Op margin, if you exclude for restructuring, was at 29.5%, up 140 basis points over the last year, and the performance was driven by really a wide array of businesses, but principally in our Industrial Fluids business, our Pump business had another great quarter, up double-digits in orders and sales. U.S. distribution remained strong and targeted growth efforts are gaining traction and driving project wins in oil and gas and the chemical markets. Ag continues to perform well and has had solid pre-season orders, that's a good signal for the momentum of the future, and our OEMs have been optimistic and have confirmed that outlook. In Energy, we had a strong quarter for Energy, up double digits in orders and sales, and the market conditions look favorable here into the future. All right. Let's go on to Health & Science, I'm on slide 6. I was very pleased also with the performance here at Health & Science. Q3 orders were up 9% overall, 8% organically. Sales were up 7% overall, 6% organically. Excluding restructuring expense, adjusted op margin increased 130 basis points to 23.5% due to higher volume and productivity. In Life Science and in Optics, our IVD/Bio business and our Life Science Optics businesses are outpacing their markets due to targeted new product development in collaboration with our customers. And the Finger Lakes acquisition, that integration is going well. The technology offerings are already helping us better serve our customers. In HST in the industrial side, we had double-digit order growth and sales growth in the third quarter, driven by some large new product development wins. These were achieved by some great work by a team at Gast. The Sealing Solutions, it continues to perform well in the industrial, automotive and the oil and gas end markets, although we are seeing some slowdown in semicon, although that is still growing in the single digits. And finally, in MPT, strong overall commercial activity in pharma & food and we have seen a pickup in India. Okay. I'm on our last segment, Diversified. I'm on slide 7. Q3 orders were up 2% overall, 3% organically. Q3 revenues were up 10% overall, 11% organically. If you exclude again for restructuring, adjusted op margin was 27.7%, which increased 300 basis points over last year and again attributable to volume and productivity. In Dispensing, we had strong project volume in North America that drove a significant amount of their growth in the third quarter, while the rest of the world remains somewhat steady. And we did see some push and pull between the third and the fourth quarters in Dispensing, and I'm sure when we get into question-and-answer we can talk about that. But we did have some revenue move into the third quarter and out of the fourth quarter here, that was meaningful for Dispensing In Fire & Safety, the Fire business posted positive orders and sales growth versus last year, even though there is some constraint in the OEM supply chain. The Rescue business posted double-digit orders and sales growth this quarter, driven by some nice project wins around the globe. And finally, at BAND-IT, energy continues to recover, industrial run rates are stable, and OEM volume continues to be above expectations. All right. Let's conclude here with some comments on guidance for the fourth quarter and for the year. I'm on slide 8. In Q4 we're estimating the EPS ranging from $1.25 to $1.27 with organic revenue growth in the range of 5% to 6% and operating margin around 23%. The Q4 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 26%, primarily driven by the revised assumptions related to repatriation taxes associated with the 2017 tax reform. This is providing approximately a $0.07 headwind in the fourth quarter. We'll also have about a 1% top-line headwind from FX based on the September 30 rates and corporate costs are expected to be $18 million to $20 million in the fourth quarter. If we turn to the full-year, we've increased our full-year guidance of EPS as we're now at $5.35 to $5.37. This is up $0.08 on the low-end and $0.02 on the high-end from our previous guidance, due to the Q4 tax pressure that we noted. Full-year organic revenue growth is expected to be approximately 8%. We guided 7% previously. Op margin is expected to be 23%, and overall, we'll have a 1% tailwind from FX based on the September 30 rates. The full-year effective tax rate, it will be approximately 23%. But I think everybody knows that the IRS is still working through interpretation, so there could be some volatility in overall tax numbers as we get to the end of the year. CapEx is anticipated to be over $50 million and free cash flow should be around 105% of net income due to the pension distribution and the increased capital expenditures that I mentioned before. And finally, corporate costs will be in the $78 million to $80 million range. As always, our earnings guidance excludes any associated costs of future acquisitions or restructuring. With that, let me pause here and, Sherry, let me turn it back to you for any questions that we have. Operator : Thank you. Our first question is from Mike Halloran with Robert W. Baird & Company. Please proceed. Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Good morning, guys. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Good morning, Mike. Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: So, Andy, why don't you just talk about your perspective on where we are cyclically right now? Obviously, order rates are really strong internally. It certainly seems like still strong order rates from some of the more leading indicator-type businesses, you mentioned BAND-IT in the prepared remarks, but a lot of volatility with the tariffs and things like that. So, just some color on where you think we are cyclically and what it means for your sustainability of the underlying dynamics right now. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: You bet. So, Mike, I think there are three things that are really important. The first one is, where are we sitting in the cycle relative to kind of what a normal cycle looks like. And the issue that we've talked about quite a bit with folks is, we've got a very long overall cycle that we're bumping up against, but the industrial cycle is actually still pretty young. If you think about, we're just two years out of a really tough industrial recession. And so, I think that, overall, that kind of clouds the overall cyclical conversation. So, that's number one. Number two, the indicators within the business are really quite good, meaning, if you just look at the strength of our businesses across the board, it's \u2013 you're still struggling to find weak spots. And look, as you get further into this, you run into comps, you get into fourth quarter... Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: ...comps become more difficult. 2019, the comps become very difficult. That's just the reality of where we are. But the indicators of \u2013 are the markets healthy, are the geographies healthy, with some exceptions in emerging markets. But generally in the places we play, boy, it's hard to find a soft spot. And then you get into \u2013 I think the two items that I mentioned in my prepared remarks which are inflation and tariffs and, of course, the go hand-in-hand. And I think that that's the danger. I think that's where you have a dangerous potential of both rising inflation and a market rolling over at the same time, which is probably why our stock has traded down $26 in four weeks. But when you kind of \u2013 when you look at that, I think it does \u2013 it creates a pretty cloudy picture of what you would think would be strength in a relatively young industrial cycle. But these issues of tariffs and inflation have people concerned, right. They have customers concerned, they have suppliers concerned. And so, we are \u2013 as you would imagine, we've always said, we are \u2013 it's much easier for us to adjust to the upside than the downside. So, as you might imagine, we're being pretty tough minded about thinking about the future, we want to be prepared if anything does happen. At the same time, there's really nothing that would tell us that something negative is on the immediate horizon. Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Great color. And then, let's take that last point and segue into a conversation on. One, how are you guys responding to the inflation pressures? Obviously, you called out a $2 million of headwind in the fourth quarter, I'm assuming it's kind of the run rate into next year, how do you feel you are relative to the inflation pressures that probably could \u2013 probably persist in the next year? How on top of that? And then, secondarily and related, how do you think about the overall margin picture for the organization? You're at peak in two of the three segments, really close to peak enough in your Fire & Safety, Dispensing side... Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yeah. Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: ...there's still opportunity for progression, but maybe marry those two in the conversation about where do you think margins, how much room and runway there are in margins in the context? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: So, our goal relative to price-cost is obviously to continue to have that positive gap that we've had historically, which has been 20 basis points to 40 basis points, and we still have that today. The \u2013 I can't see why we wouldn't continue, we've been on the front edge of pricing and we'll continue to do that as we go into 2019. The inflation side has ramped up a lot. We \u2013 if we saw inflation that was running at 20 bps or 30 bps of sales, if you just use that as a percentage of sales, a proxy, that's gone up to 80 bps or 90 bps recently, if you kind of look at those run rates. And so, then you add in the impact of tariffs and whatnot, and we still have positive price-cost, and it's our expectation to stay there. So, I don't think there's a reason why we're going to give up margin in terms of that relationship in total. So, I feel pretty good about that. As you go forward, I don't worry about peak margins if we continue to have a relatively decent growth environment, meaning, if we continue to see growth \u2013 underlying market growth in the 2% to 3% range and we can go get our couple hundred basis points on top of that, we're going to flow through, right, we're going to see flow through that's in the 30% to 35% range. The flow through on this quarter was pretty hot, as a matter of fact, little bit hotter than you really like it to be, frankly. But we'll still be able to produce at that level. And the reason that I don't think we're going to hit a threshold like maybe a lot of companies are going to hit in this environment is that, we still have a lot of room between our contribution margins and our operating margins, right. So, we're not hitting a threshold where we need to now put in a bunch of fixed costs that are going to naturally depress overall, the overall margin profile. So, we still have that gap, and so incremental volume still flows through at pretty attractive rates. Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great color, as always. Appreciate it. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: You bet. Operator : Our next question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Good morning, Deane. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, maybe just a follow-up on that last point on Mike's questions there. Did you give the specific price, gross pricing in the quarter, and then where do you expect to be for the year? I know you've reaffirmed the target of 20 basis points to 40 basis points positive price spread, but what was price? William K. Grogan - IDEX Corp.: Yeah, it's \u2013 hey, Deane. This is Bill. It increased in the third quarter versus the second quarter. We were at around 1 point in the second quarter. We've elevated that, and our expectation, it's going to continue to increase here into the fourth quarter. That's primarily due to inflation from just a material and wage perspective, it's flattened out sequentially, and the incremental drag we have is really the additional tariffs we've seen. So, the incremental pricing is really out there to offset that tariff run rate as that escalates here into the fourth quarter. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yes. So, we're north of 1 point, Deane, and that will get a little bit better here in the fourth quarter and we expect to be a little bit better into next year. With the total inflation also inching up and we'll keep that 20 bp to 40 bp positive gap. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And just to clarify that, $20 million \u2013 excuse me, $2 million tariff headwind, what's included in that assumption? William K. Grogan - IDEX Corp.: That is the direct impact and what we can calculate on the indirect impact is our supply chain is fragmented with their purchasing from overseas. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: It's not perfect science, Deane. We are literally going line item by line item to do it. But then you have all of the other impacts, the second derivative impacts that happen that you can't kind of factor into it. But that's what we see is going to hit our P&L flowing through material cost and into the business. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. And then, just to switch gears, but also to use the term Andy used a moment ago about thresholds, and this is a high-quality problem question to be asked. But what's your willingness to pass the threshold into a net cash position? I think everyone applauds your discipline not chasing bad deals because those are with you forever. And is there a \u2013 any sensitivity about passing that threshold into 2019? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Deane, I don't think we get \u2013 when do we get there, Mike? We get there at the end of the... Michael J. Yates - IDEX Corp.: Second \u2013 yeah, second half of next year. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Second half of the next year, yeah. So, I guess, the direct answer to your question is no. I always sit back and think about what's the \u2013 what are the smartest things to do to drive overall long-term total shareholder return. And to me, that becomes a little bit of a fictional issue of building cash or not building cash, right, we want to do the right things, if I don't have something better to do with it, I'm better to build cash. And so, if we got \u2013 if we found ourselves with an inordinate amount of cash three years from now, maybe we're having a different conversation, but I don't believe we'll be there. So, if we pass it in 2019 and we're in a net cash position, I'm okay with that for a period of time. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. And then, just last question, and you \u2013 I think you asked for the question in Q&A, but can you just give us the color what's going on, on the Dispensing side and the push outs? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yeah. So, it's actually \u2013 we had some relatively large project, order activity that ended up hitting in the third quarter that we thought was going to go in the fourth. And so \u2013 and you know, we kind of see this periodically in that business, it doesn't happen to us a lot. So, we had a little bit better revenue here in the third quarter and we'll be a little bit lighter in the fourth quarter because of it Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Did you size that? William K. Grogan - IDEX Corp.: Yeah, I would say, within the spend, FSD is really where there is a little bit of the Q4 pull into Q3, and it's about $5 million from Dispensing and about $3 million from the Rescue business. So, if you calibrate it, the organic growth, if you \u2013 between the two quarters would be 8% and closer to 7% in Q4. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yeah. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : That's helpful. Thank you Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: You bet, Deane. Operator : Our next question is from Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey, good morning... Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Hi, Scott. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): ...Andy, Bill, and a hearty welcome back, Mike. Michael J. Yates - IDEX Corp.: Thanks, Scott. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I wanted to ask about the restructuring in the quarter because it looks like we've got a little bit of an outsized charge in HST, and what exactly did you guys see there that how do you go ahead with that type of number? William K. Grogan - IDEX Corp.: Hey, Scott, it's Bill. That's primarily related to, we opened up the Rochester Center of Excellence that we've been talking about. And the final building moves were completed \u2013 two out of three were completed within the third quarter which was a significant amount of the incremental expense. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): So, there is \u2013 please. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Go ahead. Go ahead, Scott. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): No, I was just going to say that, so on that piece, we shouldn't look at that as necessarily a dollar for dollar cost saving number in the... William K. Grogan - IDEX Corp.: Correct. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Right. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yeah, that's probably fair, but that \u2013 look, this is very exciting. We're going to officially open the building, we have operations going there, but we're going to officially open that building here in a few weeks. And it's a big deal, right. When you look at what we're going to have there in Rochester around optical capability that's going to be best-in-class and our ability to continue to win content on new programs worldwide, this is a great win for us. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yep. Thank you for that. I guess, my follow-up is very simple and it's maybe more from the frontline folk. Obviously, the concern in the industrial markets right now, there are several things, but one of them is certainly, if tariffs and inflation maybe start to take a choke hold on demand... Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yeah. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): ...you guys are very short cycle, and so \u2013 in a number of your businesses. And so, I was just wondering if \u2013 what the customers are saying about that to this day? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: It's an interesting thing, and I think I said something similar in the last call. But what people are saying and what people are doing aren't necessarily the same things. And so, what do I mean by that? So, there is a lot of chatter out there about what inflation and what tariffs mean and the risk to overall demand, there's clearly a lot of chatter out there in the customer base and supply chain, et cetera. And I think where you could see that play itself out is, if you saw project activity slow down, right. So, I don't expect to see the book and ship, the book and bill business, that's been pretty steady. The real driver in changing demand over the last two years, yeah, clearly book and ship business has gone up, but you've seen project activity pick up. And I think where the risk is, people go, okay, wait a second here, I'm going to push off my decision-making until I get clarity. That to me is a real risk. We haven't seen evidence of that yet, Scott, to be clear, but that is something that we're really looking out for. And the problem with things like that is, it can move, that stuff can shift pretty quickly. It can get pushed out of when you think it's going to go to being pushed into the future. And so, it's something that we're keeping our eye on. But if you just look at the overall book and bill business, it's in the industrial world, it's solid, I mean, it's good. And so, as we go through the quarter here, I think we'll know by the middle part of November \u2013 I think we'll know by the middle part of November, as you get close to Thanksgiving, of whether or not anybody starts getting happy feet around some of the stuff. So, to your point, we're still a short cycle, we don't have an insight into that today except to say that our business looks good, but that's the thing that we're going to be watching out for as we get into the \u2013 deeper into the fourth quarter. R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay, thanks. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: You bet. Operator : Our next question is from Steven Winoker with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Peter Lennox-King - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning, guys. This is Peter Lennox-King on for Steve. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Hi, Peter. Peter Lennox-King - UBS Securities LLC : I was hoping that we could talk a little bit about the CapEx increase in quarter. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yeah. Peter Lennox-King - UBS Securities LLC : In particular, as you were talking about the fixed cost front in the margin discussion. And could you just lay out for us where you're investing, whether that's incremental planned investment to cope with the higher growth rate that you're seeing. And then from that, is that incremental investment along with the pension contribution, the reason for the slightly lower free cash conversion guidance for the year? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: So, Peter, let me \u2013 I'll talk to it a little bit, and then I'm going to ask Bill to jump in too on it. So, generally, if you look at our CapEx, our CapEx was actually a little bit lighter in the first part of the year than we had expected, and a bunch of that is due to how quickly things can be delivered. So, as you think about equipment lead times, they've been extended. I think, I talked about that in the last call. They've been extended more than we would have expected. So, we were a little bit lighter than we would have liked to have been in the first half of the year and we caught up with a bunch of it here in the second half. So, I wouldn't say there's anything surprising in that $19 million number. It's not like something we just found in the third quarter and decided to invest in. These are things that have been long planned and in process just generally. And the vast majority of that is around growth, and that's the exciting part. So, as I look into 2019, 2020, 2021, and I look at the things that we're investing in, we just finished our strat planning internal discussion and we'll have that discussion with our board here in a couple weeks. Those investments are all aligned with the bigger growth initiatives that we're teeing up. And hopefully the things that will drive couple hundred basis points of outperformance that we've been able to deliver here in the recent future. So, I feel good about the investments. The timing is a little bit between first quarter and second quarter, and it's kind of nothing that popped up. And Bill, do you want to \u2013 anything else you want to add to that? William K. Grogan - IDEX Corp.: No. I think, as we went through and a lot of the capital investment's really around new product development tooling, where we've done a build-out of a couple engineering labs across the organization, cleanroom capacity in some of our higher tech businesses. And then, the last piece, obviously, there's a significant part of growth, but we have talked a lot about productivity through new equipment relative to addressing labor shortages across the portfolio. So, we have retooled a couple sites with increased machine capacity to address skilled labor consolidation within various markets. So, I think it was probably two-thirds growth and a third of some of that productivity capital that will help us in the next year, too. Peter Lennox-King - UBS Securities LLC : Great. That's helpful. And then, is that CapEx along with the pension the reason for the slightly lower... Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm sorry, we didn't answer that direct. Yeah. So, we had $19 million incrementally or $19 million in CapEx. What do you think that was over our normal run rate, maybe $6 million, $7 million? William K. Grogan - IDEX Corp.: Yeah, exactly. So, we raised our guide, it was around $45 million. It's going to be a little bit over $50 million for the year now, and the pension expense at $10 million. That reconciles back to 110% of free cash flow. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yeah. Peter Lennox-King - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: You bet, Peter. Peter Lennox-King - UBS Securities LLC : Then, if I could sneak in one more on just the capital deployment or the M&A sort of environment. Is the recent volatility that you're seeing in the market, is that \u2013 do you think that's going to help shake some deals loose here in the near term? And how are you sort of seeing the conversations that you're having with people? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Peter, I actually think it's going to have the opposite effect in the near term. I think some of the things that have been coming to market might end up with more pressure than the sellers would have liked, and it may actually make them hesitant. I'm hoping that people find religion relative to valuations. But I think, if anything, it might actually put a little bit of a pause on some folks who have pretty high expectations. Now, that being said, if we get something sustained, then you'll start to normalize, right, you'll get things to normalize a little bit. But you got to get off the sugar high that's existed here for quite some time and get into some level of realism. So, I think it's going to take some time for that to play itself through. Peter Lennox-King - UBS Securities LLC : That's great. Thanks very much, guys. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Thanks, Peter. Operator : Our next question is from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed. Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities : Hi, guys. Good morning. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Hey, Allison. Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities : On the tariff cost pressure with your component suppliers, can you maybe talk to the opportunity to adjust that supply chain to mitigate some of those costs, do you have that opportunity? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: We do, and we've done some of it already. We actually buy the vast majority of our supply chain is in region for region, so we're not buying a ton of stuff across borders. There is some. So, in places where we can consolidate and we are doing some of it. And then, on the other side, we have a few pockets of opportunity where we're actually moving production. So, we're moving production from some regions into others. It's not big, to be clear with you, it's not big numbers. You know that's just not something that we can do. But places where we actually have the opportunity to get closer to a customer base, we are taking some of that and moving production from regions that are being negatively impacted by tariff. So, we're doing a little bit on both sides, but they're not big numbers, Allison. Bill, anything to add to that? William K. Grogan - IDEX Corp.: No. I think you hit the two major work streams. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Okay. Yeah. Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities : Got it. And then, you touched on the supply chain challenges that you had in the first half, and then it looked like in Fire you had a little bit coming maybe on the OEM side. Are those starting to worsen, are they kind of stable at this point, any color around that? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yeah. To be clear, Allison, the supply chain issues that I was talking about are specific to Fire, and they're actually specific to the Fire OEMs who are our customers. So, we're able to deliver to them, but they're having other issues relative to supply chain that's slowing down a shipment. So, you're seeing the backlog build substantially in that customer base. So, that just did \u2013 the fact that it slows down our ability to roll that business. So, we'll see their ability to pull out of that, but they have a huge backlog. If you look at the main truck builders in the U.S. in particular, they've got a big backlog. Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities : I guess, on that point, do you have the visibility in that Fire business or could we see some, I guess, volatility in numbers quarter-to-quarter because of that? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: I don't think so. I think actually if you \u2013 any volatility in the near-term is going to be positive if they get better at shipping. But I don't think you're going to see them increase by 10% or 20% their volume coming out of their factory. So, I think it's going to be marginal. William K. Grogan - IDEX Corp.: Yeah, if anything, it stabilizes a bit... Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Right. William K. Grogan - IDEX Corp.: ...if there is a downturn, because they're going to work off that backlog as the macro economy slows. Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities : Got it. Thank you. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: You bet, Allison. Operator : Our next question is from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please proceed. Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Good morning. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: So, Andy, you talked about \u2013 a little bit there about that your kind of worst fear of what could happen in the macro economy here as being kind of a stagflation environment or recession with inflation in it. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yeah. Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: You guys have talked about maintaining a 20 basis point to 40 basis point spread above these inflationary pressures. Given the strong demand, you can say how that's possible to do. If you got into kind of your worst possible outcome environment here, would you still be able to maintain that spread, are the businesses critical enough to the customers? You've got nichey businesses with high market shares. Do you think you could still maintain that kind of spread in that kind of environment? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: I do, Nathan. I think, is it possible that in a quarter or two in that kind of \u2013 what you're describing is a radical environment that we haven't seen in 40 years, right? Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: But if you got that, could you \u2013 I think we would keep it. Certainly, if you look at it in a year-long window, I don't think we'd go negative, and I don't believe there's been a time in IDEX history when we have. Would there be \u2013 would it be really tight? Yeah, it'd be a lot tighter. But that would work itself out in a matter of a quarter or two. I don't believe there's any environment that would be sustained in a way that we get behind that curve for any meaningful period of time. Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: That's helpful. And I know we've talked about inflation and you guys have signaled that \u2013 for a while now that you expected inflation to get worse in the back half of this year, and it sounds like you expect it to get worse in 2019. Can you talk about maybe what you're expecting in terms of inflation to hit the P&L in 2019 given everything that you know at the moment and understanding that... Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yeah. Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: ...that's a moving target? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: So, I think \u2013 so, let's \u2013 for a second, let's separate tariffs and other inflation, and then obviously they come back together in total inflation. But, in what I'd call a core inflation, that's actually starting to stabilize. So, if you look at what's happening with supply and demand generally in our market spaces, you're seeing that stabilize. The wildcard that destabilizes all of this is tariffs. And I think that, if you look at what's going to be enacted on January 1, assuming that it happens, there is another impact that I think is pretty meaningful. And then, where I get concerned are, what bullets are left in whose guns and how our actors going to behave based on that. And so, given the fact that certain actors don't have many bullets left, they can start to work with regulatory issues, they can start to work with the ability to slow down permitting and stuff like that, right, that also turn into inflationary issues. And so, my point of view is that, as we go into 2019, assuming that the demand environment is essentially what we have now that the incremental inflation is going to be tariff-driven and that's just \u2013 that's a wildcard because we just don't know how people are going to \u2013 we don't know if people are going to be rational or irrational, we just don't know. Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks very much. That's all I got. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Okay. Thanks, Nathan. Operator : Our next question is from Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed. Matt J. Summerville - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Thanks. Couple of questions. First, can you give a little bit more geographic specificity in terms of what you experienced organically across the regions and whether or not, in China specifically, have you seen any discernible change in business tempo into October? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yeah. So, generally, if you look at it, our \u2013 China and India were very strong for us. But I would put the vast majority of that strength on our ability to execute. China has been a terrific turnaround story for us here in the last 12, 18 months, and has driven really nice growth. The U.S. would be next, and then Europe has softened. It's still positive, to be clear, but it has softened compared to what we were seeing earlier this year, late last year. So, that's how I kind of rack and stack them. In terms of China specifically, I do think that the underlying conditions have softened. I don't think we're going to see it in a big way in our numbers just because I think we've got a lot of initiatives that are going to continue to drive growth for us here in the near-term. But when you talk to folks in China and you see the underlying conditions, it is pretty clear that that has softened, and there is a lot of concern, right. When you talk to people independently in China, there is a lot of concern about the overall slowdown that they are experiencing. Matt J. Summerville - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Are there any specific end markets, Andy, that you would call out either in Europe or China that may stick out to you as we head into 2019 as maybe being softer spots potentially for you? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Bill, would you think anything specific to call out? William K. Grogan - IDEX Corp.: No, I mean, little bit on the Municipal side. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yes. That's what I was thinking too. Yeah. William K. Grogan - IDEX Corp.: That would be the one I'd probably point to. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yeah. Muni has softened generally and that's very susceptible to government spending. So, that's one. So far, the more cyclical businesses, so I'm thinking oil and gas and chemical, those have been really good, and we haven't seen indicators, but those \u2013 back to Mike's question early on, those are some that can pause pretty quickly with slowing down projects. So, we've got our finger on the pulse of that pretty carefully. But there isn't \u2013 I would not say that a singular industry that jumps out other than maybe Municipal. William K. Grogan - IDEX Corp.: And then, I would say, it's been really positive this year, so I think... Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yeah. William K. Grogan - IDEX Corp.: ...it will slow next year. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yeah. Matt J. Summerville - D.A. Davidson & Co.: And then, just a follow-up in terms of how customers or how their concern on tariffs, and the comments you made earlier, Andy, are you seeing any customer behavior that would suggest they're actually trying to buy ahead of some of these things, including the potential ramp-up, incremental ramp further on January 1? Are people trying to get ahead of that? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: We did see a little bit of behavior early in the quarter that we can't demonstrate it. We can't prove it, but it did look to us like folks were accelerating some buy in the July and August timeframe. We did see some of that, but again, because so much of what we do is configured, that's a harder thing to do in our business generally, but we do think we saw a little bit of that. And, yeah, could we see that pre-January? We could, we could. But I don't think \u2013 you're talking a point or two here or there, it's not five points. William K. Grogan - IDEX Corp.: And for anyone who did try to put an annual PO in to get ahead of anything next year, we didn't let them do that. We consolidated the amount of time they were going to be able to buy ahead on purchases. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yeah. Matt J. Summerville - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Got it. Thank you, guys. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Thanks, Matt. Operator : Our next question is from Brett Linzey with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed. Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hi. Good morning, guys. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Good morning. Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hey. You called out Energy as strong, you had a little bit of follow-up commentary as well, but maybe just talk to some of the projects or the size and scope of the engagements that you're seeing out there. And then, maybe just a little bit more color on the pace of activity in upstream versus mid in some of your chemical markets? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yeah. So, on the oil side, you got to remember, again, where we play. We play more in the midstream, and as you recall, we knew that that business was going to be kind of later in the overall pick-up, and that has been the case. The two places we're seeing at the most are really our LC and our Corken brands. Both of those have had a nice run here this year and real strength in the third quarter, and we expect that to continue. The overall truck builds for LC have been good. And our Corken business, they're benefiting from the market, but they've also done a great job in terms of some new products and their ability to serve customers that I think is differentiated. So, I think they're winning some share there. In the overall chemical markets, really no change. I think you're seeing the CapEx that we hadn't seen in some time. The book and bill business is stable and we expect it to be, and it's going to really all be driven by what happens with CapEx. Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay, great. And then, maybe just shifting to Muni, I think in your prepared remarks you said that business was stable. Are you suggesting the rate of growth is slowing a little bit and dollar revenues are sort of flattening out here, maybe just a little bit of context on your comment? And then, just the overall state of spending with different metrics and issuances... Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yeah. Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC : ...starting to moderate here? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: So, our view is that the Muni market in the Western world is moving to a low-single-digit, more normalized growth rate after a pretty good run here. And so, we think that we're looking at that low-single-digit growth as we go into 2019 and even further out as we think about our own strat planning period. And all the data around it suggests whether it's tax receipts or the projects that we're seeing, everything supports that point of view. Obviously, in the U.S., enforcement is at an all-time low, and so we don't expect to see a pick-up from anything in that regard. And so, we think we've entered into a pretty normalized environment that gets impacted by the overall economic condition. So, if the overall economy remains relatively good, I think we see this kind of 2-ish-percent growth in the markets. And if we get a pick-up, that picks up a little bit, but I don't think it moves in a big way from either side of that growth rate. Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay, great, I'll pass it along. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Charley Brady with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed. Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Good morning, Charley. Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: You had some comments on semiconductor, it sounds like maybe the only area that you're actually seeing a little bit more slowdown. Can you just put a little more color around that? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yeah. So, if you look, we don't have a large concentration in semi. You're talking about a few points of our overall business. But we've had a great run there. If you look at our Seals business, if you look in our Pump businesses, we've had a really, really nice run with semiconductor here. Part of it's been the overall strength of the marketplace, and then, we've continued to take market share. And so, it's been a good new story for us. Our expectation has been and is that there's been so much capacity that's come on that you're going to have to, even though you have the secular growth story, which I do think is real, right, the secular growth story in the semiconductor world I buy into, but I don't buy into the idea that it's not cyclical. And so, I just \u2013 I think we're going to \u2013 we're seeing some of the digestion of all the CapEx that's come on, I think growth rates will slow, and if there's a little bit of a cyclical downturn, won't surprise me. But I think the overall secular story is a good one. Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great, thanks. Appreciate that color. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: You bet, Charley. Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Just one more for me. It sounds you guys are always obviously big on new product development, R&D spending... Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Yeah Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: ...but it sounds from some of your commentary and maybe the investments you've made that may have stepped up a little bit, I'm just trying to see if I'm reading that correctly, or is it just typical IDEX that we've seen historically? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: I think, we have stepped it up some, Charley, and \u2013 but it hasn't been \u2013 it's not a new thing. If you went back even a couple of years ago, we called out some incremental investments when we guided for the year that surprised people a little bit. And I think the work that we have done around segmenting our businesses to really better understand those applications where we have real advantage and we can really grow in a faster way within segments, we've done a better job of doing that, and the capital and the people investments have moved disproportionately to those things. And so, it's kind of great, as we're looking at our strategic plan here for the next three years, we've been through that here in the last couple of weeks, it's really fun to see a larger number of bigger bets that we're making, and capital and organization that are aligning with those. And so, when I think about our ability to outgrow our markets by couple hundred basis points, forget about \u2013 you can pick the market growth rate that you want, can we or can't we do that? I have increasing confidence that we can do that. So, if we end up with a \u2013 in a 2% world in 2019, boy, I hope we can deliver 4%, and then you can kind of go from there. So, I feel good about the actions and the alignment, and we're really at multiple years into this journey already, so it's not like we're starting from scratch. Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got it. Thanks very much. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: You bet. Operator : Our next question is from Joe Giordano with Cowen & Company. Please proceed. Tristan Margot - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Good morning. This is Tristan in for Joe, thanks for taking the question. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: You bet. Tristan Margot - Cowen & Co. LLC: Could you talk a little bit about the inventory levels of your distribution network especially for FMT, and then how much of order growth in the quarter was due to maybe inventory levels, if any? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: I don't think any, Tristan, yeah. We \u2013 the only places that we really have a good piece of visibility into that is really in our FMT business, mostly around industrial distribution. And if you look at where we get POS and the sell-through rates, it indicates that we're in pretty good shape. I don't think there's been a large buildup. We don't \u2013 our distributors don't stock a lot of stuff anyway. So, I don't \u2013 we don't kind of get a lot of benefit or a lot of \u2013 or a hit on the head when you see those things bump up and down. So, generally, I feel pretty good about it. Tristan Margot - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. And then, just another quick one. You obviously appear to be outperforming a lot of your markets. So, I was wondering how much of this is your ability to target your sales force or how much is due to simply having the right product? Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Tristan, for us, when I think about segmentation, it is an alignment of all of your resources. So, number one, it's a clear choice of where you want to play and where you have an advantage. So, you're aligning sales, you're aligning application engineering, you're aligning new product development, and then obviously your ability to serve is aligning too. That to me is the key. So, it's not just one piece of the organization, it's around segmentation, resource allocation, and our ability to focus an application at a time that I think allows us to differentiate. Tristan Margot - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks. Andrew K. Silvernail - IDEX Corp.: Thank you very much, Sherry. Well, first of all, I want to thank all of you for your interest in IDEX. We're obviously living in a pretty volatile time that we're all looking at. But I feel great about our company. We have \u2013 we've built a team here across our 7,000 people that understands how to deal with any of these environments, so whether things are moving at an accelerated pace forward or we hit an air pocket, either one, we know how to run this business, it's an exceptional business, it's well-positioned to deliver outperformance, and I feel very good about that. And with that, I want to thank the folks at IDEX. This is a great team of people who consistently deliver day-in and day-out, and I want to thank everybody. And then finally, just before we go, being a Mainer at heart and growing up in New England, I got to say Go, Red Sox. So, thank you very much, everybody. I look forward to talking to you in the next 90 days. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Bill Grogan. Thank you. You may begin. Bill Grogan : Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone. This is Bill Grogan, Chief Financial Officer for IDEX Corporation. I am stepping in for Mike Yates this morning and will cover the introduction. Mike unfortunately lost power overnight due to the pool of vortex hitting Chicago and he is anxiously awaiting power to get restored to his house. We are hoping to get back power soon, Mike. Okay. Let me start by saying thank you for joining us for discussion of the fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial highlights. Last night, we issued a press release outlining our company\u2019s financial and operating performance for the 3 months and year ending December 31, 2018. The press release, along with the presentation slides to be used during today\u2019s webcast can be accessed on our company\u2019s website at idexcorp.com. Joining me today is Andy Silvernail, our Chairman and CEO. The format for our call today is as follows. We will begin with Andy providing an overview and update on market conditions, geographies and our capital deployment strategies. I will then discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial results and walk you through the operating performance within each of our segments. And then Andy will wrap up with our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2019. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions. If you should need to exit the call for any reason, you may access a complete replay beginning approximately 2 hours after the call concludes by dialing the toll-free number 877-660-6853 and entering conference ID 13684161 or simply log on to our company homepage for the webcast replay. Before we begin, a brief reminder. This call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the Safe Harbor language in last night\u2019s press release and in IDEX filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I will now turn over the call to our Chairman and CEO, Andy Silvernail. Andy Silvernail : Thanks, Bill and good morning everybody. I appreciate you joining us here to discuss the fourth quarter of last year and also the full year operating results from 2018. I am going to start with some highlights from 2018 and then move to the outlook for 2019. 2018 was another record year for IDEX. We hit all-time highs of all of our key metrics and we continue to outperform the market. The overall macro economy was strong and our teams capitalized. When we leveraged our target of organic growth initiatives to deliver results above and beyond the underlying market support, we continue to invest back in our businesses with record levels of CapEx and engineering investment in 2018. Those investments helped drive our terrific top line performance as well as margin performance. We saw over 100 basis points improvement in op margin in all three segments. Our balance sheet is in great position and we have plenty of capacity to deploy capital across our framework and drive long-term value for shareholders. Looking ahead to 2019, we are monitoring the geopolitical and global economic environment and its volatility. However, we are confident in our long-term strategic objective to grow faster than the underlying market. We are able to do so as a result of our leading positions and diversified product portfolio and we look forward to another solid year in 2019. Now, let me take a moment to talk about what we are seeing in the markets that we serve and the regions we do businesses in. In the industrial market, the conditions remain favorable and we see this in both FMT and in HST. Day rates for our book-and-ship businesses continue at high levels, project activity is decent, and our growth funnel is very solid. In Scientific Fluidics and Optics, our life science markets continue to expand. We are seeing strong growth across IVD/BIO and DNA sequencing driven by new product, project traction and share gains. In energy, we did see some softness in Q4 and with the fluctuation of energy prices we expect to see that kind of throughout the year as it firms up now that could get better as we go into 2019. The teams continue to drive growth through new project activity and over serving our customers. In ag, the OEMs are holding up, but depressed commodity prices and lower net farm income are concerning. We are watching that closely as we head into 2019. On the municipal markets, the North American market is stable and expected to modestly expand. Our focus remains on new product development in water and investment in emerging markets within fire and rescue. The semicon market is small for us relative to our portfolio, but it\u2019s growing rapidly in the last couple of years. It was a difficult market in Q4 and we see more softness into next year. Now, let me move on to the geographic outlook. Sales across all geographies performed well in the quarter with North America leading the way. We are starting to see lower market support in Europe and in Asia, but our targeted growth initiatives have driven positive results across the globe. Looking ahead, the fundamentals are still decent as evidenced by stable day rates and strong project funnels, but we do have pockets of concern in some markets and general caution with the overall 2019 global economic condition. Let me switch gears for a second here and talk about what we are seeing with tariffs and inflation. In the current tariff environment, if we expect that to continue, our best estimate is an incremental $5 million to $7 million of impact in 2019. We will continue to employ internal countermeasures to offset these additional costs and we do not see them as significant headwinds for us as we go into this year. Inflation has slowed down on the materials side, but we are experiencing wage inflation. However, we have and will continue to mitigate inflation through productivity and price realization. Again, regardless of the external environment, which we expect to be more challenging and remaining volatile in 2019, we are committed to outperform our markets. Let\u2019s turn now and talk a little bit about M&A. The current valuation environment remains the biggest hurdle for us when it comes to acquisitions. Our team is hard at work with evaluating several deals, but we are going to be disciplined with our return framework and we will only move forward when our target has great strategic impact and financial impact and it fits our style of competition. Shareholder returns is our number one focus and we will continue to evaluate deals with our commitment of providing long-term shareholder value. Our balance sheet is in very strong position and when the right deal comes along, we will capitalize on it. Our gross leverage is 1.3x and our net leverage is only 0.6x. Consistent with our balanced capital allocation framework, we repurchased $174 million of stock in 2018, with $122 million of that coming in the fourth quarter with opportunistic purchases. We also returned $127 million to shareholders in 2018 via dividends. I am going to pause now. I am going to turn it back over to Bill Grogan who is going to talk about financial results and our segment discussion. Bill Grogan : Thanks, Andy. I will start with our consolidated financial results. I am on Slide 4. Order rates slowed down in Q4. We were up 1% overall and 2% organically. For the year, orders were up 7% overall and 6% organically, a solid year from an order intake perspective. For the Q4 slowdown, I will get into more detail as we go through the segment discussions, but I would like to say this, our core industrial franchises did extremely well in the quarter. Secondly, we did see some timing related issues where we had some early receipts in Q3 and some delays out of Q4. And finally, we did see some true softness in a few markets, but we think the quarter is closer to 5% organic growth number if we normalize for some of these items closer to where we think our new run-rate will be for 2019. From a sales perspective, Q4 revenue was up 5% overall and organically as well. While fiscal year revenue was up 9% overall and 8% organically, this was our highest organic sales growth since 2011. We expanded gross margins by 10 basis points for both Q4 and the year primarily due to production efficiencies and volume leverage. This was partially offset by investments we made in engineering related to new product development. Q4 adjusted operating margin was 23.3%, up 120 basis points and fiscal year adjusted op margin was 23.4%, a 150 basis point increase. The teams did an excellent job of leveraging the great organic performance throughout the year in the bottom line results. Q4 net income was $98 million, resulting in EPS of $1.27. Excluding restructuring expenses, adjusted EPS was $1.31, up $0.19 or 17%. Full year net income was $411 million with EPS of $5.29. Again, excluding restructuring expenses, adjusted EPS was $5.41, up $1.10 or 26% higher than last year. Our Q4 effective tax rate was 23.8%, resulting in an ETR of 22.4% for the year. Both rates were lower than our previous guidance resulting in $0.04 of EPS favorability in the quarter. The difference was primarily due to additional interpretations the IRS provided in tax reform, along with the reduction in the statutory rate in the Netherlands. Free cash flow for Q4 was strong at $137 million, up 14% and 136% of adjusted net income, which resulted in full year free cash flow of $423 million, which was up 9% and 101% of adjusted net income. Free cash flow was only up 9% for the year, primarily due to working capital and capital expenditures investments that we made to support our long-term growth. In regards to the balance sheet, it remains very healthy. Gross debt leverage is 1.3x, while our net debt leverage is at 0.6x. The combination of our strong balance sheet, capacity on the revolver and free cash flow provides us the ability to deploy well over $1.5 billion over the next 12 months. I will now turn to our segment discussion I am on Slide 5 starting with Fluid & Metering. FMT continues to deliver strong numbers from both an order and a revenue perspective. Q4 orders were flat overall, up 2% organically, while full year orders were up 6% overall and 7% organically. The lower order rate was primarily driven by the timing of precision orders for Banjo, wherein Q3 orders were up 36% and Q4 orders were down 5% as well as we saw some project push out in the quarter in the chemical and energy markets. Q4 sales were up 7% overall and 8% organically, while full year sales were up 8% overall and 9% organically. Adjusted for restructuring expenses, Q4 op margin was 29.1%, up 70 basis points over the prior year quarter. Full year op margin was 29.2%, up 150 basis points. FMT\u2019s performance was primarily driven by market growth across the industrial and chemical sectors, coupled with continued stability in the muni market. Those served as the core drivers of growth or year as evidenced by strong global demand in core distribution and project wins across the group. Oil price fluctuations in Q4 did postpone some investments, but we are seeing market conditions improve as we have seen prices increase and stabilize. Ag order rates did slow in Q4 primarily due to the timing of the pre-season orders I mentioned earlier, but the fundamental economics in ags do give us some concern heading into 2019. Project funnels in various end-markets remains strong and active, but have been less predictable in timing as we close out the year with the backdrop of caution in the global market. However, overall, the targeted growth efforts across our businesses in this segment continue to gain wins and market share regardless of the slower market support. Let\u2019s move on to Health & Science, turning to Slide 6. We are very pleased with the Health & Science results both for Q4 as well as the fiscal year. Q4 orders were up 10% overall and 9% organically, while full year orders were up 10% overall and 7% organically. In the quarter, the 9% organic growth was aided by some timing shifts related to receipts of annual POs by some of our large OEM customers. Q4 sales were up 8% overall and 7% organically, while fiscal year sales were up 9% and 6% organically. Excluding restructuring expenses, Q4 adjusted op margin was 23.4% and full year adjusted op margin was 23.6%, both margins up over 110 basis points over the prior year. HST\u2019s performance was primarily driven by continued success in our IVD/BIO and our Life Science Optics businesses, where they continue to outpace the market due to targeted MPT efforts in collaboration with key customers. HST industrial remains strong with double-digit growth due to some large wins within our gas business and also continued strength in their day rate distribution business. Strong execution in MPT drove customer lead times and helped enable growth. We also had some solid project wins in the pharma and food space that drove double-digit orders increases. Finally, despite the downturn in the semicon market, our Sealing Solutions continue to perform well in oil and gas and the industrial end markets. I am moving on to our final segment, Diversified. I am on Slide 7. Q4 orders were down 10% overall and 8% organically primarily due to the lumpiness of our dispensing business, coupled with the timing of large annual blanket order at BAND-IT, while full year orders were up 5% overall and up 4% organically. Q4 sales were down 2% overall and 1% organically, while full year sales were up 9% overall and 7% organically. I will give more details on that in a moment. Excluding restructuring expenses, Q4 adjusted op margin of 26.5% was flat with the prior year, while adjusted fiscal year end operated margin was 26.8%, up 170 basis points from prior year. FSD sales performance was primarily driven by our fire business reporting high single-digit growth due to strength across most of their product categories and geographies. Rescue sales were up due to strong project volume in emerging markets and several wins in key markets in the U.S. BAND-IT saw growth across most of its verticals with transportation sales up due to significant volume increases in their airbag applications through new platform wins. They also had some nice project wins in the Middle East. The sales growth in Fire & Rescue and in BAND-IT was muted by the lumpiness of the dispensing business, which was down 25% for the quarter, but it was up 7% for the year. Dispensing does have market leading positions across all of their geographies, but it is our most project oriented business and creates tough comps from time-to-time. The dispensing sales decrease was the primary reason for op margin being down \u2013 being flat for the quarter as well for FSD. I will now pass it back to Andy to talk about our expectations for 2019. Andy Silvernail : Thanks, Bill. Everybody I am on Slide 8 and we can walk through 2019 guidance. So, on an operational basis we expect full year organic revenue growth to be in the 4% to 5% range, which will provide $0.30 to $0.50 of benefit to EPS. We expect our productivity initiatives to offset inflation and then leverage these actions to drive about $0.03 of benefit over 2018. As I mentioned earlier, our focus has always been to invest on our best organic opportunities, people, new products as well as new applications for existing products. We will continue to make these investments across all three segments and these growth investments will create about $0.05 of pressure in 2019. Although our two acquisitions in 2018, Finger Lakes and Phantom will provide very modest boost to the top line in 2019, we are not expecting a significant benefit to the bottom line because of deal amortization. Let\u2019s take a quick look at a couple of non-operational items. First, FX, it will be a headwind in 2019 based on the December 31 rates and provide about $30 million of top line pressure. The bottom line pressure from FX, it has two pieces to it that together add up to about $0.15. $0.11 is from FX translation due to the higher rates plus an additional $0.04 on foreign currency transaction gain that were recorded in Q1 of 2018 as we unwound intercompany loans relative to 2017 tax reform that we talked about last year. Second, share buyback activities that we mentioned before have taken our share count down and it boosts our EPS in 2019 by about $0.06. So in summary, we are projecting organic revenue growth in the 4% to 5% range and have EPS expectations of $5.60 to $5.80. We are going to wrap things up here. I will summarize things regarding 2019, the fourth quarter and the full year I am on our last slide, that\u2019s Slide 9. In Q1, we are estimating EPS of $1.35 to $1.38 with organic revenue growth again in the 4% to 5% range and op margin at about 23%. We are projecting a 1% top line headwind from FX again based on the December 31 rates, which translates to about $0.02 of EPS. However, as I mentioned earlier, we are also facing an additional $0.04 of FX headwind from the transactional gain that we incurred in Q1 of 2018. The Q1 effective tax rate is expected to be 22.5% and corporate costs should be about $20 million to $22 million. If we turn to the full year 2019, again, EPS is expected to be $5.60 to $5.80. Full year organic revenue growth should be in the 4% to 5% range and op margin ought to be about 23.5% to 24%. Top line FX will be impacted by 1% again based on the December 31 rates. Full year effective tax rate should be about 22.5%. CapEx is anticipated to be about $60 million and free cash flow should be about 105% to 110% of net income and corporate costs are expected to be in the range of about $80 million to $84 million for the year. As always, our earnings and guidance exclude any potential associated cost, future acquisitions or restructuring. With that, Matt, we are going to pause here and I will turn it back to you for questions from folks on the phone. Operator : Great, thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Allison Poliniak from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Allison Poliniak-Cusic: Hi, good morning. Andy Silvernail : Hi, Allison. Allison Poliniak-Cusic: Want to go back to, I think I heard it correctly on the order rates in Q4 I am trying to normalize some of the puts and takes, were you saying the order rate was around 5% organically or did I hear that wrong? Andy Silvernail : Yes. We will talk to it and let me give a little bit of high level and Bill if you want to jump in, go ahead. So, it was a pretty unusual quarter from an order perspective, Allison. And what I mean by that is if you kind of look at our normalized book and turn business and our normalized funnel that was kind of right in that 4% to 5% range. So, it was real solid, but we had a bunch of things that moved around. In dispensing, we had some \u2013 it had some pretty big overall project things that moved around and actually in BAND-IT too. And so in both those places, we had some pretty good sized chunks of things they got pushed over into 2019 and so, I can I would certainly understand the concern of the headline organic 2%, but I do think that the underlying day rate support is more in that mid-single digit. Bill, anything you want to add? Bill Grogan : Yes. As Andy said, lot of puts and takes, but if you normalize our core as we reconcile the business, as we prepare to go into 2019 really comfortable with a close to 5% organic number in Q4 hence our guide for the balance of \u201819. Andy Silvernail : What I would add to it too, Allison that I did mention, on the positive side, in the fourth quarter, we had a real nice blanket order that happened in HST, and so we will see a hole relative to that, that usually has happened historically in the first quarter and it happened in the fourth quarter so as we when we are talking again here in 90 days, you will see some headwind from that, on an order rate basis in HST, so just so just you understand the puts and takes. Allison Poliniak-Cusic: Great, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then you talked about project push I think you mentioned chemical specifically is this just typical project push-out that happen or is there some feel like something underlying is going on there at this point? Andy Silvernail : The fourth quarter was a pretty lumpy quarter I mean historically what we\u2019d see is we\u2019d see strength ramp through the quarter in the fourth quarter, it happened right up until the holidays, that\u2019s what kind of things would look like and what the quarter looked like here was a weaker October, actually a really good November and then a weaker December and what we and so, obviously we\u2019ve been talking with our customers to make sure it\u2019s not something systemic, and what we just heard time and again is with all the craziness in the world, there was a big pause in December and so and by the way, what we\u2019ve seen in January supports that so I walk out of January not feeling really concerned about what we saw in December and I think it\u2019s normalizing now Bill, anything you want to add? Bill Grogan : Yes, I\u2019ll just say so that point is, the things that we saw push in December, we realized several of those here in January. Allison Poliniak-Cusic: Great. Thanks so much. Andy Silvernail : You bet, Allison. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Halloran from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Michael Halloran : Hey good morning, everyone. Andy Silvernail : Good morning, Mike. Michael Halloran : So, just following up on that, when you think about the non-lumpy pieces of the business, so getting rid of dispensing and any of the other project-oriented stuff, how have you seen trends track trying to strip out comparisons, they\u2019ve been relatively stable in the context to that, or has it seen some of that same December stall and then reaccelerate? Andy Silvernail : No, there\u2019s been well, it may be a little bit of that, but not as much, is the I call it the project related stuff, Mike and so, generally the day rate businesses and if you look at if you got to think of day rate businesses, it\u2019s basically everything except for a couple of things in life sciences that happen once or twice a year, dispensing, MPT and then the BAND-IT thing, they\u2019ve got a couple of large customers that they typically put in blankets that move around but that\u2019s it\u2019s not really project related, Mike, it\u2019s more just when does the blanket hit. Everything else in the portfolio so you\u2019re talking 75% of the business is, you\u2019re looking at day rate type stuff or maybe two-thirds of the business and that\u2019s real stable, nothing surprising there. Michael Halloran : And you always offer a good broader perspective so maybe you can try to balance what is will its, certainly confident commentary on your side and growth expectations for \u201819 that are healthy, with a lot of the headline news we\u2019re seeing and some of the regional risk and geopolitical risk out there, and how you\u2019re blending that all together? Andy Silvernail : Yes. So maybe Mike, the way to take a step back and think of it is, we believe we\u2019ll deliver 200 basis points 200 basis points to 300 basis points better than the underlying market and as we have triangulated on global industrial production forecast, those look to be in kind of the 2% to 3% range and that\u2019s what kind of gives us confidence around that 4% to 5% as we think about this year that being said, we were very purposeful in our written commentary here in our prepared remarks about the volatility that we continue to see in the world I think that the fourth quarter that variability that you saw, October, November, December, is really is a good example of what I think the world is going to look like we had eight quarters of sequentially ramping growth rates and I think, we mentioned a quarter or two ago, certainly last quarter that we thought that was going to change and become more lumpy, more volatile and that is where we are and so if we, if we buy into a 2% to 3% industrial production, we will land at that 4% to 5% we feel very confident but that underlying volatility is real and it\u2019s something we\u2019re paying a lot of attention to. Michael Halloran : So, just one follow-up on that then when you because there is volatility month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter here, what are you guys tracking or looking at internally to get a sense for what is just volatility or cause for something more cause for more concern? Andy Silvernail : Yes, so there honestly there are kind of two or three things that really matter, right so if you think about what accelerates our business or decelerates our business, Mike, one is, is what\u2019s happening to day rates and so and day rates actually matter more to us than anything else because so much of our business is quick turn, and so we\u2019re monitoring those and in those, we\u2019ve always talked about the BAND-IT core industrial business, the Gast business, the Warren Rupp business, those are three really good beacons and right now they tell us that things are okay that\u2019s what they\u2019d say so that day rate piece is something we spend time on as you look at project, as you know, Mike, we don\u2019t typically do big projects I mean, there is one here, one there, that\u2019s really meaningful what matters though is the size of them and what\u2019s happening to where they sit in the scheduling when you start to see projects shrink in size, number one and number two, they get multiple kicks down the road, that\u2019s when you start to worry, right when you get something pushed from December to January, you kind of get it, especially when it shows up in January, you understand it and you get the January no, it\u2019s now April, nope it\u2019s not when you start to get that and things that were $1 million have now gone to $2.50 million that\u2019s when you start to get concerned the last thing I\u2019d say is, just really close relationships that we have with our OEMs and our value-added distributors those are conversations that are just happening every day now, sometimes they don\u2019t know their own business as well as we do sometimes and so understanding kind of what\u2019s happening to their turnaround, we don\u2019t see a lot of things stocked for the most point, but we do have electronic compounds at major OEMs, so we monitor those and we do have a handful of distributors who are a little bit more classic in their inventory setups and so we watch those too. Michael Halloran : Good context is always appreciated. Andy Silvernail : You bet. Operator : Our next question is from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Andy Silvernail : Hi, Deane. Deane Dray : And a special shout out to Mike to get his power back and get back to normal. Andy Silvernail : No kidding, [indiscernible] below, Deane, when I drove in, that didn\u2019t include the wind. Deane Dray : That\u2019s just gets dangerous, so good luck with all that I think you\u2019re sending it our way to the East Coast. Andy Silvernail : Oh boy. Deane Dray : Just let me echo Mike\u2019s comments just then and how helpful It is that you were able to parse out your business and the indicators, that\u2019s real helpful to us and just to clarify, I heard Bill chime in at the end on Allison\u2019s question about those two orders that were pushed, the dispensing and BAND-IT so, are they in that January category, maybe just to provide color on those, just it\u2019s so fresh. Bill Grogan : So, the BAND-IT order, they split their annual PO into two 6 month PO\u2019s so we expect that to get the BAND-IT piece later in the first half in dispensing, a couple of projects we have landed and expect to land here within the next couple of weeks. Deane Dray : Good. You said BAND-IT, it\u2019s typically a blanket type order and so that\u2019s not the price. Bill Grogan : Deane, that is a very specific large Aerospace customer that we have, most of the balance of their business isn\u2019t that type. Andy Silvernail : Yes. Bill Grogan : It\u2019s isolated really to a single customer and how they\u2019re breaking up their orders in 2019 versus what they\u2019ve done in the last two years. Deane Dray : And we\u2019ve seen some softening in the whole dispensing supply chain, is that also what you\u2019re seeing there? Andy Silvernail : So, the issue you have with dispensing is, we monitor market share gain pretty carefully, right, because of our leadership position and to make sure that we\u2019re not losing anything significant so that\u2019s kind of number one number two, when you get into some of these larger programs, they hit periodically and it just makes for frankly a really difficult comp when you go for and you can\u2019t go for a year or two without having that and so we had some activity in \u201818 as we closed out \u201817 as we closed out \u201918 we didn\u2019t have that and we\u2019ll see what happens here in \u201819, right we track every single age of machine and replacement cycle and et cetera, but it\u2019s really driven by some of these larger paint retailers and whether they\u2019re going to refresh or not and we just don\u2019t know that really until a few months until they\u2019re ready to move. Deane Dray : Got it. And then just to swing over on the 2018 free cash flow, came out on the right side of that 100% threshold that everyone watches. Andy Silvernail : Yes. Deane Dray : And you parsed out the two factors, which makes sense, a higher working capital and the CapEx so maybe some color there, how much of the working capital reverses and then on the CapEx, can you call out any of the projects and what kind of IRRs that you\u2019re seeing or that you expect on those investments? Andy Silvernail : Want to tackle that one? Bill Grogan : Yes, sure so I would say specifically on the CapEx, I think this year we looked at a bunch of investments relative to new products and getting the capabilities to enhance our ability to get to market faster we looked at several businesses that we had the opportunity to upgrade equipment to improve productivity and throughput to support the increased growth that we had these are 12 to 24 month returns, higher than our overall IDEX return on invested capital number, so no-brainer from an investment perspective and the team has really took a hard look as we\u2019ve seen CapEx ramp still significantly below most of our peer groups relative to the capital we need to operate the business in but high-return projects relative to the working capital, there is some opportunity here as we level out on the growth side to unwind some things and you see our guide is higher than the 101% that we saw in 2018. Deane Dray : Great. And just last quick question on Fire and Safety have the orders started to show up yet in India? I know, that\u2019s a big growth opportunity for you guys where does that stand? Andy Silvernail : Yes, I was actually over there between Thanksgiving and Christmas and we did a specific review on that and that\u2019s actually starting to play out nicely we are starting to get some of the wins the spend, as you know, it is a little bit of a national and then it turns into kind of regional or state, how the funds are distributed and we are seeing some of that break and we\u2019re seeing some pretty nice growth there. Deane Dray : Terrific thank you. Andy Silvernail : Thanks, Deane. Operator : Our next question is from Nathan Jones from Stifel. Please go ahead. Nathan Jones : Good morning, everyone. Andy Silvernail : Hi, Nathan. Nathan Jones : I\u2019m going to go to the margin side of this the guidance for 2019 has only 30 basis points to 40 basis points of margin expansion. Andy Silvernail : Thank you, Nathan. Nathan Jones : Well, it is significantly less than what you guys have been doing for the last few years so I\u2019m wondering, if we could if we can talk a little bit about the puts and takes there, I\u2019d imagine that there is probably not that much left in your fixed bucket at the moment that says margins crop up a bit obviously, there is some impact from higher investments here, probably a little bit lower incremental margins because you got little bit lower organic growth but just if you can walk through kind of the puts and takes of that margin increase in 2019? Andy Silvernail : I think, let me talk about it first and if Bill wants to kick in too, we\u2019ll do that but I think the increase that we\u2019re looking at, to me is what a normalized expansion should look like based on the kind of growth that we\u2019re factoring, right so that to me feels right frankly, in 2018, our margin expansion was a little high right? So, it obviously we outgrew our expectations and so you just got much stronger incrementals throughout the year I\u2019ve said a few times that, look, if you\u2019re below 30% incrementals, you\u2019re probably investing too much and if you\u2019re above 40% for a long time without kind of structural actions, then you\u2019re probably not investing enough so this feels about right and I think we can sustain that at those growth rates and then if you saw the world get tougher, our job would be to boost that and not lose a lot of ground here, right and if for some reason we saw some improvement in growth rates, we\u2019d probably invest a little bit more probably not as aggressively as we have the last two years, but we\u2019d probably invest a little bit more, Nathan, than we have and part of if you go back to the bridge, you looked at Bill, I may get this wrong, so correct me but I think last year we laid out $0.16 of incremental investment for the year in our bridge. Bill Grogan : A little bit less than that, it was double digit. Andy Silvernail : Yes, and this year it\u2019s kind of 5-ish so you can see we are definitely tailing that back down a little bit based on how quickly the environment is expanding. Nathan Jones : Does currency impact the margins at all or is it primarily just translation that just affects the actual dollar number but not the margin? Bill Grogan : Correct. Andy Silvernail : Translation. That\u2019s right. Nathan Jones : Got it. But maybe just I know everybody is fairly concerned about the environment in China I don\u2019t think you guys do less than 10% of revenue over there, but you do have a few businesses that participate over there so just any color you can give on what you\u2019re seeing in China at the moment? Andy Silvernail : Yes, absolutely. And part of that trip where I was in India, I was in China in that same period too so that was a big question we were talking about here just a month ago. Look, it is definitely slowing, there is no doubt about that there are the concern on the ground in China is pretty substantial when you get when you start talking to people who are living it day to day, they are concerned about the growth rates we have had some really strong growth in China in the last year or two, because we\u2019ve frankly fixed a problem that we\u2019ve had for a while and so we\u2019ve had some good growth, and we expect to see some continued good growth because of that but I do think overall that market support is coming down now, the key to it then I think, Nathan, is where are you picking, right. So which markets are you picking in, this isn\u2019t a ubiquitous statement that everything is slowing but more things that not are and so I think we got to be in China, for China, to sell into the region you got to be in there for the long term, but I do think certainly in 2019, I think, it\u2019s going to be more challenging. Nathan Jones : Just last one on capital allocation you guys got a bit more aggressive in the fourth quarter on share repo is that just a function of the market melted down, and you saw an opportunity to get your stock at a good price and we shouldn\u2019t read more than that into it? Andy Silvernail : I think that\u2019s exactly right we are following the framework that we\u2019ve always talked about relative to intrinsic value and being more aggressive when we see disconnects and we saw a disconnect. Nathan Jones : Okay, thanks very much for the time. Andy Silvernail : Thanks, Nathan. Operator : Our next question is from Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Scott Graham : Good morning, Andy. Good morning, Bill. Andy Silvernail : Good morning, Scott. Scott Graham : I was hoping you could tell us what pricing was in the quarter and then what materials inflation was relative to that I know that\u2019s not how you do you look for productivity, but I am just for the purposes of the old price cost question if you could help us out thanks? Bill Grogan : Yes, price capture was a little bit over a point and the inflation we maintain that 30 point spread that we\u2019ve been able to do throughout the last 2 years. Andy Silvernail : Yes. Scott Graham : And that\u2019s just materials inflation or was that overall inflation? Bill Grogan : That\u2019s material and wage at a gross margin level. Andy Silvernail : How about they were just materials, it slowed a lot yes. Bill Grogan : Right. So there is \u2013 materials leveled off material inflation leveled off in the back half and a little bit of kicker as we saw some of the tariff increases come through in the third and fourth quarter. Scott Graham : Got it. Bill, you went through the capital allocation thinking for 2019 you mentioned the $1 billion number forgive me, but I wasn\u2019t able to write that fast so could you kind of say kind of where you guys are at in capital allocation heading into the year? Andy Silvernail : Yes, Scott we are at 1.3x gross leverage and 0.6x net we have we said in our commentary it was over $1.5 billion, it\u2019s closer to $2 billion, that we have availability on at any time here in the next 12 months. Scott Graham : So, would it suggest that in the absence of M&A that your $0.06 of share reduction benefit for \u201819 might prove conservative? Andy Silvernail : Fully depends, right so we\u2019re going to stick with the framework, and as we\u2019ve said several times, but just to remind folks. In our framework, we take a look at and we just did it in the fall with our Board, we take a look at what we think the long-term intrinsic value is we build in a buffer relative to opportunity cost of capital and then as we see our stock behave relative to that, we decide how aggressive we\u2019re going to get, and we build that framework into a 10b5-1 in closed periods and we use the same framework in open periods and so what we try to do, Scott, is really bring disciplined to it so it\u2019s not people reacting emotionally to good good or bad news. Scott Graham : Got it. Last question, can you tell us after essentially what is now the first month, you indicated that your sort of run rate, your day rate orders are \u2013 was kind of 5-ish in the fourth quarter. What does that number look like in January? Andy Silvernail : It\u2019s not much different, right. It\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re basically kind of on our plan so far through the year. So, we feel pretty good about it, I mean, just we started the year, not \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t get overly excited about it and it\u2019s not bad news, it is basically what we expect. Scott Graham : Understood. Thanks a lot. Andy Silvernail : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Matt Summerville from D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Matt Summerville : Thanks. Just two questions. First, can you give a little bit more geographic granularity around how you performed in North America, Europe, Asia for Q4 around that 5% and then what the expectation is sort of around the 4% to 5% that you\u2019re guiding organically for \u201819? Andy Silvernail : Yes. So we \u2013 so North America as we said in our comments, North America continues to lead the way and has so for quite some time. And all indicators, Matt, suggested that\u2019s going to be the case in \u201819, unless we see a material global softening, right, which \u2013 that is the biggest concern that I have, right. The biggest concern that I have is the volatility that we have, the geopolitical instability that\u2019s out there, the length of duration of the expansion overall, not the industrial, but the overall. That\u2019s what I think the risk is, but North America has continued to be strong. Asia and Europe both started to soften 2 quarters ago. I think we mentioned that in the last call and that\u2019s continued. Now Asia is \u2013 it kind of depends upon where you are, right. So, China has softened. India is still pretty good and other parts of kind of Asia-Pac have been okay. Europe, I think the biggest concern in Europe is Germany, right. We\u2019ve got a pretty good footprint in Germany, we export a lot to other parts in the world from Germany. And the softness that I think everybody experienced was above expectations, right. It was softer than people had thought. And so that\u2019s a place that we\u2019re keeping a pretty close eye on. Matt Summerville : And then as my follow-up, can you just give a little more detail on what you\u2019re seeing in your energy-facing businesses in FMT and with respect to BAND-IT, maybe tying in sort of up, mid, downstream commentary there? Andy Silvernail : Yes. So, as you know, Matt, we got to be somewhat careful in this commentary, because we\u2019re not the best barometers for what\u2019s going on in the energy field just by the nature of the nicheness where we play; number one, and the fact that most of what we do is kind of midstream. And so, I would just caution people that we\u2019re not the best barometer. But that being said, when oil prices \u2013 energy prices kind of tank there, we did see a slowing and it was reasonable, I mean, it was a material slowing for that piece of business, which has since \u2013 we\u2019ve seen a pick back up here. Some of what we\u2019re experiencing in terms of positives, we know are driven by our own activities. So, we\u2019ve got some very specific wins that we\u2019ve got in BAND-IT that we can put our finger on, they were kind of non-market related. Same thing I\u2019d say over LC and Corken. And so the \u2013 I would say that the general market conditions have been softer with recently a little bit of improvement, but I still think that that\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m going to put that in the cautionary category. And our job is to keep getting wins and frankly keep taking down lead times. One of the things that we\u2019ve certainly learned around energy is that the folks who are deep in the upstream, the pricing sensitivity is brutal when things go South and we just don\u2019t have that. So, that\u2019s not a place we want to put big bets into the future. But also lead times really matter, right. So, your speed of service and quality of service is a major advantage in those markets. And so, we\u2019re spending more time there trying to build that advantage. Matt Summerville : Thanks, Andy. Andy Silvernail : Thanks, Matt. Operator : Our next question is from Joe Giordano from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Joe Giordano : Hey, guys. Good morning. Andy Silvernail : Hey, Joe. Joe Giordano : So, Andy, I got to say you sound more optimistic than I expected on this quarter. Andy Silvernail : Well, I think, Joe, it\u2019s \u2013 I obviously \u2013 everyone gets a little bit of reputation. Yes, I think my optimism is more on our ability to execute than it is on the markets, to be clear, right. I just \u2013 we\u2019ve built some really excellent capability around executing and look we\u2019re calling \u2013 we are kind of living with what the global \"experts\" are saying around global industrial production and that\u2019s a really good starting point for us. But where I feel good is our ability to consistently outperform. And so, a lot of this depends upon what\u2019s your view is, right, of the markets. And at this stage we\u2019re not bucking the trend. We do tend to be earlier cycle. And so, I will tell you there are parts of the fourth quarter I got a little nervous during the fourth quarter because of the clunkiness that we were seeing. And that coming back has given me a better feeling about certainly earlier in the year. Joe Giordano : So, you\u2019re talking about the 200 bps that you expect to do over market and I think you\u2019ve proven the ability that that\u2019s a reasonable expectation. But when you think about that market component, that other 200 bps, we \u2013 I have a couple auto guys that we talk to, it\u2019s a different market clearly, but they\u2019re guiding like way underneath what current third-party estimates are for growth. So, do you feel like you\u2019re gaming the market at all or you just like this is the number with it will probably go down, but we\u2019re using what they say for now like, that makes sense? Andy Silvernail : It\u2019s hard to tell, right. So, our \u2013 my point of view of this is, we kind of start with what do we think the world \u2013 what does the world thinks going to happen or the experts saying is going to happen and we tend to be a little more bearish on that than average, right. So, if you \u2013 if the world is saying two to three, we will tend to go more towards two than we will towards three, right. And then from there, it\u2019s really starting to dissect where we have exposure and where we don\u2019t, right. And the nice part of our portfolio is we have really broad exposure, and so there is no lot on the margin that happens relative to our exposure versus global exposure, except maybe in a quarter, right, a quarter or a half year. And then it\u2019s really driven by our ability to get some things done. And so, as I sit here, my confidence level on our ability to execute is high. My confidence level on the responsibility and the capability of the folks who are in the geopolitical discussion is exceptionally low. I have no confidence that they\u2019re going to get it right. And so, my concern then, right, is an event that gets driven by the intersection of the aging cycle and the irresponsibility of global leaders. Joe Giordano : I think that\u2019s definitely fair. Last thing from me. So, you guys spent a lot on growth investments this year, you\u2019re calling out another $0.05 next year, so obviously less of an incremental, but still a big number off a big year like in growth dollar terms. So, are you \u2013 do you feel like you\u2019re teeing up more and more things to start restructuring and taper down like maybe not executing on them yet that things have gone \u2013 day rates still look good, but are you like teeing up more of this stuff now than you were like maybe a year ago? Andy Silvernail : I think this \u2013 if I actually take a look at cap spending, let\u2019s go back 2 or 3 years, right, that\u2019s when it started to pick up a little bit, we went from kind of 1.6%, 1.7%, we\u2019re now kind of 2.1%, 2.2%. So that, call it four-tenths to five-tenths of a point of increase in cap spending. What that\u2019s been associated with is really is the function of all of the segmentation work we\u2019ve been doing for half a decade and getting better and better at picking the organic growth opportunities and the productivity projects that have much bigger banks of the block. And so if I go back to my comment just a few moments ago, my confidence level about our ability to execute over and above whatever the market does is really based on that, and so that investment is mirroring that condition. And so, I think where we are is, I feel pretty comfortable that we\u2019re in a range of where we like it to be for a while. Joe Giordano : Fair enough. Thanks guys. Andy Silvernail : Thank you, Joe. Operator : Our next question is from Walter Liptak from Seaport Global. Please go ahead. Walter Liptak : Hi, thanks, guys. I think I\u2019ve got one question left for you. We covered a lot. I want to go back to the margin questions and you\u2019re netting inflation with productivity. And so, I wonder if we could just drill down into that productivity part of it. How do you feel about productivity in 2019 and how much more is there to go on \u2013 bringing up margins in 2019, 2020. Is there still lot of work to be done? Bill Grogan : Hey, Walter, it\u2019s Bill. I would say a couple of things. First, I would refer to Andy\u2019s earlier comment on margin expansion in that 30 basis points to 50 basis points relative to the 4% to 5% growth that we\u2019ve seen. Relative to our ability to drive incremental productivity, there is still stuff out there. I mean, the teams had a rolling 12-month funnel that, that we leverage, actively looking at ways to improve material costs through alternative sourcing, re-engineering parts to take cost out, labor efficiencies, overhead streamlining through. We did a site consolidation this year and other capital investment to improve our overall throughput with enhanced technologies. So, as we look at the funnel, our projects that we have signed up for this year from our internal plans is on par with what we delivered in 2018. Walter Liptak : Okay. And just thinking about that longer term, you guys have done a great job with productivity over the last few years. Are we \u2013 are margins sort of peaking out here or is this the kind of a process where you can keep on going for a number of years and continue to be at that 30 basis points to 50 basis points margin improvement? Andy Silvernail : You know, Walt, I think we can still go get more. And I\u2019ve kind of two pieces of thinking around that. The first one is, we spend a lot of time looking at the difference between our contribution margin and our op margin. And when you do that walk, right, you\u2019ve got about a 40 point walk that we call conversion cost. And so, you can still reinvest aggressively back into the business and still very, very actively improve conversion cost to get the kind of lift that we\u2019re talking about without starving the business. So that\u2019s kind of the first, just I think structurally one of the things that I think makes IDEX different, far more \u2013 on average more attractive financial engine, for lack of a better term, is that reality, right. And so, if you assume you\u2019re going to get positive growth in the business, once you get kind of past 2%, at about 2% you\u2019re paying the bills, right, you\u2019re covering your normal inflation. And once you get past that, you have the ability to get some level of expansion. And if you\u2019re in the mid-single digits, you\u2019re going to get that 30 basis points to 50 basis points, chances are. And I think that, that reality of the IDEX economic engine, I think is really, really important. And so, we just spend a ton of time, when we say productivity, right, we\u2019re not trying to grind out kind of marginal productivity. We go into every cycle. When I say cycle, Bill said we got a 12-month rolling funnel. Every time we have a business review, we\u2019re looking a year forward and we have a base expectation that the people are going to cover or do better than inflation. And when you partner that with a business to get positive, it gets positive price, there\u2019s really no reason why you can\u2019t continue to see margin expansion. Certainly, as you move from what we\u2019re calling now 23% to 24% into the mid-to-high 20s. Walter Liptak : Okay. That sounds great. Okay, thank you. Andy Silvernail : Thank you, Walt. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back to management for any closing comments. Andy Silvernail : So first of all, let me just say thank you for everybody for your time and your effort that you put into \u2013 to following IDEX. We appreciate the analyst community and we appreciate our investment community. I think it\u2019s important to note, we are very cautious about the underlying environment, right, that\u2019s out there in terms of where we are in the cycle, in terms of the likelihood of a recession. We very much believe that somewhere in the next 24 months to 36 months, there\u2019s going to be a recession, and we believe that to be true. At the same time, we think that the long-term relative to the industrial cycle, we actually think is really attractive. And so, we want to put ourselves in a position to really win over the long-term. And I like what we\u2019re doing in terms of focused investment, putting our money in our highest priorities, continue to segment our business, building our team and the team has done a great job and I want to congratulate them. They\u2019ve really been outstanding. And so, I want to thank everybody there. And then just as a final word before we go, being a main native from New England, I\u2019ve got to say Go Pats. So, with that, we will cover things, we will finish up the day, I want to thank you, Matt, and thank you, everybody again. Take care. Operator : Great. Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you again for your participation.",

Before we begin, a brief reminder. This call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the Safe Harbor language in last night's press release and in IDEX's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I'll now turn our call over to our Chairman and CEO, Andy Silvernail. Andy Silvernail : Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everybody and thank you for joining us for our first quarter call. I'd like to start with some key themes. Q1 results were strong and somewhat better than our expectations from 90 days ago. Bill will walk you through the details, but overall I'm pleased with our organic growth in both orders and sales, the team's execution was outstanding driving operating margin expansion and cash flow and this helped us deliver another quarterly EPS record driven by both operational outperformance and favorable tax rate. Momentum continued in our industrial, municipal and life science markets both partially offset by softness in ag and semicon as well as some lumpiness in our project-oriented businesses, specifically dispensing and MPT. There were some concerns of slowing global economic \u2013 the global economy and those do remain, but we're confident in our ability to grow faster than the underlying markets as result of our market-leading positions, our ability to capture price, and deliver on our targeted growth initiatives. Putting it all together, we're raising our full year EPS guidance while maintaining our organic revenue growth expectations. Now, I'd like to take a moment and talk about what we're seeing across the markets we serve and the regions we do business in. In the industrial market, the overall conditions remain favorable with continued strength in OEM and our targeted growth initiatives. We are however seeing some day rate volatility in pockets of our business, due to customer caution about the macro outlook. In Scientific Fluidics and Optics, our life science, our markets continue to expand. Our IVD/BIO business is leveraging new product launches and platform wins to our growth and the AI market demand remains solid. In Energy, we're seeing some rebound due to the higher oil prices. Mobile truck builder demand is increasing and we're seeing positive signs in the aviation fueling space. In municipal, the North American market continues to modestly expand. Our focus remains on new product development notably a recent launch of new hydraulic tool in our SAM system and Fire & Rescue, as well as continued expansion in emerging markets. In ag, we're expressing some contraction due to macro uncertainty around the soybean tariffs and the OEM slowdowns. We are seeing some growth in Latin America and Europe, but North America is a challenge. In semicon, we continue to see broad-based pressure by lower investments in Asia and the downturn in memory chip demand after substantial growth in 2017 and 2018. In auto, as you all know, there's been a slowdown of global light vehicle sales and that's driven some softness in this market, but as you know that's a relatively small piece for us. Now, let's move on to the geographic outlook. Sales across the majority of geographies performed well in the quarter with North America leading the way. Asia was positive, specifically India and China was primarily driven by our initiatives versus the macro trends. The European economy lost some traction in Q1 and we saw some supply chain disruptions ahead of Brexit. And finally, we are seeing some softness in the German economy. Nevertheless, our targeted growth initiatives and new products continued to drive positive results around the globe. All right. Let me turn now to capital deployment. M&A continues to be a priority for us. With that said, there remains a challenge in the current environment, due to valuation. Our teams have evaluated several deals, but our approach has not changed and we will remain very disciplined with our return framework. We will only close on a deal that fits the IDEX sales competition and delivers long-term value for our shareholders. This remains our number one priority. As I said, our balance sheet it is very healthy our gross leverage is 1.3 times and our net leverage is 0.6 times. When the right deal comes along for IDEX, we will capitalize on it. In terms of the other capital deployment, we did repurchase $52 million of stock in the quarter at an average price of about $140 a share. We also returned $33 million to our shareholders via dividends. Let me know turn it over to Bill, who is going to go over our financial results and our segment discussion. Bill Grogan : Thanks, Andy. I'll start with our first quarter financial results on slide 4. Q1 orders of $655 million was an all-time record, and was up 4% overall and 6% organically. All three segments were up with FMT leading the way. Q1 revenue was $622 million, up 2% overall and 4% organically. We expanded gross margins by 40 basis points to 45.6%, primarily due to price, production efficiencies, and volume leverage, partially offset by investments in engineering related to new product development. Our Q1 operating margin was 23.8%, up 120 basis points compared with the adjusted prior year period, mainly driven by our gross margin expansion, lower intangible amortization, and lower variable compensation costs. Q1 net income was $110 million resulting in record-high EPS of $1.44, up $0.15 or 12% over prior period -- prior year adjusted EPS. Our Q1 effective tax rate was 19.5%, which was lower than the 24% in the prior year period, mainly due to an increase in foreign tax credits, discrete tax expense in the prior year period, and the mix of global pre-tax income. The first quarter ETR of 19.5% was also 300 basis points, lower than our previously guided amount, mainly due to a higher excess tax benefit from greater than expected stock option exercises in the quarter. This lower tax rate accounted for five out of the seven EPS favorability compared to the midpoint of our previous guidance. The remaining $0.02 of EPS favorability was operationally driven. Free cash flow was solid at $76 million, up 12% over the last year, and 69% of net income. This was our highest Q1 free cash flow of all time. In regards to the balance sheet no change here. Gross and net leverage remain very healthy. The combination of our strong balance sheet capacity on our revolver and free cash flow provides us with an ability to deploy $2 billion in the next 12 months for the right opportunities. I'll now turn to the segment discussion. I'm on slide 5, starting with Fluid & Metering. FMT continues to deliver strong numbers, from both an order and revenue perspective. Q1 orders were up 8% overall and 10% organically. Q1 sales were up 4% overall and 6% organically. Op margin was strong at 29.6%, up 110 basis points over the adjusted prior year quarter, mainly due to price, volume leverage and productivity initiatives. As Andy mentioned earlier, we are seeing some day rate fluctuation in pockets of the business, but overall the fundamental strength within the industrial sector continues to drive solid results. Our Viking and Richter businesses posted record order and sales in Q1 with continued project wins in the processing and chemical markets across the globe. The municipal water business remains steady, and the oil and gas market conditions have improved due to oil price increases and stabilization. The only business in this segment that contracted year-over-year was Banjo. The concerns we highlighted with the ag market in Q4 materialized in Q1, and we continue to be cautious on the balance of the outlook for Banjo. Overall, the targeted growth efforts across our businesses in this segment continue to gain wins and market share. Let's move on to Health & Science turning to slide 6. Q1 orders were flat overall, but up 1% organically. We highlighted on our last call, we expected a tougher comp for HST orders due to an OEM blanket we received early in Q4 of last year. Along with the last time buy we offered customers in Q1 of 2018, as we eliminated the product line as part of the Rochester COE project. Normalizing for the items, orders would have been up 5% organically for the segment. From a sales perspective, Q1 sales were up 2% overall and 3% organically. I'll give you a bit more color on this in a minute. Operating margin increased 10 basis points to 24%. This was primarily due to lower amortization. Core margin performance was negatively impacted by lower project volume in FX and MPT. Overall, HST's performance was primarily driven by continued success in Scientific Fluidics and Optics. Underlying AI and IVD/BIO markets remain positive and we continue to grow through targeted NPD efforts in collaboration with our key customers. Gast saw strong underlying industrial OEM demand and solid execution on our growth initiatives in the food and beverage market. On the negative side, organic growth was impacted by contraction in our sealing business, which was affected by both a downturn in semicon and lower auto sales. Finally, MPT backlog remains strong and has grown sequentially versus last quarter, but timing of project shipments is skewed towards later quarters in the year due to longer lead times. I'm now moving on to our final segment, Diversified. I'm on Slide 7. Q1 orders were up 5% overall and 9% organically. Revenues were down 2% overall, but up 1% organically. Operating margin of 25.8% increased 90 basis points in the quarter. This was mainly attributable to price, productivity initiatives, more than offsetting our volume decreases. FST's performance was driven by our Fire & Rescue business continuing to see growth across most of the product categories and geographies with several project wins resulting from new product launches. Band-IT saw growth in several of its verticals with aerospace leading the way. They also had some nice project wins in cable management. Our dispensing business was down around 15% organically for the quarter as they had a tough comp against some larger projects last year. We expect them to recover some as we progress through the year but will be down overall for the full year based upon timing of customer replenishment cycles. I'll now pass it back to Andy to provide an update on our 2019 guidance. Andy Silvernail : Thanks Bill. So, let's wrap things up and I'm going to summarize here with some additional details on 2019 for both the second quarter and the full year I'm on the last slide and that's slide 8. In Q2, we're estimating EPS $1.47 to $1.50 with organic revenue growth in the range of 4% to 5% and operating margin about 24%. We're projecting 2% topline headwind from FX based on the March 31st rates which translates to $0.02 headwind in EPS. Q2 effective tax rate is expected to be about 22.5% and corporate cost will be around $20 million. Looking at the full year, we're raising our full year EPS guidance. We now expect earnings to be in the range of $5.70 to $5.85. Full year organic revenue growth remains the same at 4% to 5% with operating margin of about 24%. Topline FX impact will be about 1% based on the March 31 rates. For the full year, we expect our tax rate to be about 22%, CapEx to be about $60 million, and free cash flow in the range of 105% to 110%, and finally corporate cost in the range of $80 million to $82 million. As always our earnings guidance excludes any costs associated with future acquisitions or restructuring. With that, Doug, let me pause here and we're going to turn it over for questions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Allison Poliniak : Hi guys. Good morning. Andy Silvernail : Good morning. Allison Poliniak : Can we go back to commentary around MPT. I want to just make sure I understand that. I think Bill you were saying sales were weak in the quarter but you have a strong backlog so it's really timing of when those projects are getting delivered. Is that correct? Bill Grogan : Yes, MPT is going to be down for the first half, but they will back up in the first half and overall positive for the full year. Andy Silvernail : Yes. So, Allison, we actually did build backlog and we actually have a great backlog position in MPT, but it's along with dispensing. Those two tend to be -- is the most lumpy of our businesses and so we're going to see that backlog flush itself through in the back half. Allison Poliniak : Got it. And then what are those one-time events that you referred to on the slide? Is that just the order commentary you are talking about? Andy Silvernail : Correct. Allison Poliniak : Okay, perfect. And then on acquisitions, we see a lot of dislocation in the markets here. Are you sensing -- I know it's been a long haul, but any sense of multiples kind of starting to pull in and any sort of change there that you think? Andy Silvernail : Not really. It's been pretty consistent and I think for us, Allison, it really continues to be working it very hard and being patient and disciplined. Eventually something will break here but the last thing we want to do is do a really expensive deal that doesn't fit our framework. So, we're going to keep our discipline. Allison Poliniak : Fair enough. And then last corporate expense, it looked that it was adjusted down a little bit. Is that just your cost control or is there something else in there? Andy Silvernail : No, just a flow through of the favorable variable compensation that we incurred in the first quarter. Allison Poliniak : Perfect. Thank you. Andy Silvernail : Thanks Allison. Operator : Our next question come from the line of Michael Halloran from Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Michael Halloran : Good morning gentlemen. Andy Silvernail : Good morning Mike. Michael Halloran : So, I'm hoping to triangulate a couple of things here Andy. If I think back you were essentially projecting from an end-market perspective kind of a low single-digit environment with choppiness quarter-to-quarter. Is that still the case, any change there? And then secondarily could you triangulate that that with some of your leading indicator-type companies? I know you didn't -- I don't think you mentioned Warren Rupp could've missed, it but Gast and BAND-IT both were really strong in the quarter, so I'm hoping you can put those pieces together for me. Andy Silvernail : So, it was actually mixed Mike. So, if you go back and you look at how the quarter developed, it was pretty soft in the first half of the quarter and then strength picked up pretty broadly as we got into the second half of the quarter. So, that was a good sign and obviously building backlog in the quarter and the 6% order rate is a good sign as we walk into Q2. That being said those businesses as we look it's been very short cycle that was mix too right. So, we had some -- if you strip out some really specific wins that we know we got and you look at the day rate business, pretty choppy in some places and then relatively strong as you lean more industrially pretty strong. So, I actually don't think that the point of view has changed much from when we talked 90 days ago. Michael Halloran : Any different on the regional side? Andy Silvernail : Yes, a little bit. I think Asia is probably a little bit better than we had expected, North America is just about what we had expected, and Europe's a little weaker. Michael Halloran : Great. Appreciate it. Thank you. Andy Silvernail : Thanks Mike. Operator : Our next question come from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital. Please proceed with your question. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Andy Silvernail : Hey Deane. Deane Dray : Hey, maybe we can start with a review of some of these sector puts and takes that a number of the multi-industries have been commenting on either there were or were not affected. So, let's start with there were some issues about pull-forward of demand out of the first quarter into the fourth quarter. There was a company last night reported at the close, where it ended up being much bigger than they thought. Did you see any of that dynamic? Was that at all related to the softer start of the year for you guys? Andy Silvernail : Not really. We had that one order in HST that we talked about at the end of the -- when we entered the quarter fourth quarter, but not a big deal. Bill Grogan : And that wasn't tariff related somebody get ahead of something that was pure timing. Andy Silvernail : No, no, no. no. That was pure timing with the customer. So generally, Deane, we're so short-cycled that we don't tend to -- we're so short-cycled and we're not generally an off-the-shelf product that we don't play a lot in some of these lack of better term games that you see out there. Last year we did see -- as the tariff stuff was taken in, we did see some crazy activity there between the second and third quarter, but in terms of looking at 2019, 2018, I don't think it's material for us. Deane Dray : Good. And then I didn't hear weather come up at all, but when I hear about ag softness, there was a company Pantera had issues there with weather. Anything on your side? Andy Silvernail : Yes. The only weather here was my house being shut down by the weather but\u2026 Deane Dray : That was last quarter. Andy Silvernail : Exactly, you're right. That was a little bit here and there, but not enough to have mattered. Specific to ag, look that market is just soft, and we saw it coming late last year. We had that bolus of activity that we cautioned everybody on that we didn't think was going to hold and that has been reality. And they're just going to have to work through their cycle. In terms of weather or not that's bottom yet. You got some people saying that I'm not sure. And so we're going to kind of hold off making that call at this stage. And -- but it's an important business for us but we think we have it triangulated in terms of the rest of the year. Deane Dray : Good. And then just last one from me. Can you comment on price costs in the quarter? And any changes in the outlook for the year? Andy Silvernail : Yes. So we're still above 1% in pricing. Inflation did settle in a little bit, so we had -- we definitely had a little bit of incremental benefit relative to the expectation of that 30 bps to 40 bps so a little bit better than expected. So we think we're in a good spot for the rest of the year. Deane Dray : Great to hear. Thank you. Andy Silvernail : Thanks Deane. Operator : Our next question come from the line of Matt Summerville from D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question. Matt Summerville : Thanks. Two questions. First, in the prepared remarks, you referenced supply chain disruptions you saw in Europe. Can you get into a little bit more granular detail on that? And whether that's still with you here as we're into the second quarter at this point? Andy Silvernail : Yes. So Matt the bigger thing there was really specific to the U.K. and we have a number of businesses fire and sealing in particular that are in the U.K. And what you saw was you saw some hoarding of product as people were ramping up to that expected Brexit date. And so we'll see how that plays itself out now that we've got that kick down -- that can kick down the road again. But you definitely saw some behavior around relationships between the U.K. and the continent in terms of supply chain. It's not that big a deal to us, but to that -- those businesses it is. And so we'll keep an eye on it, but I expect as this continues to unfold, we'll continue to see some of that wackiness. Matt Summerville : And then are you seeing any evidence? You mentioned sort of the short-cycle day rate business, but beyond that are you kind of thinking in some of your longer-cycle businesses, are you seeing any evidence that customers are delaying capital decisions awaiting some sort of outcome with all of this trade stuff? Andy Silvernail : Absolutely. I actually think that if you go back to last summer, what changed was people pulling in capital being much more hesitant about releasing larger chunks of capital, while this tariff stuff is working itself out, and obviously, with the government shutdown in the U.S. Those combined events I think made people skittish. And if you look across -- I was in China last week, and if you look across kind of behaviors what's happening in Asia, it's a big time wait and see. And then any U.S. businesses that do have a lot of China exposure is a big time wait-and-see attitude on how things are going to play out. So I do think that there is some constrained relationships between kind of natural supply and demand with this situation. Matt Summerville : Thanks Andy Andy Silvernail : Thanks Matt. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Nathan Jones : Good morning everyone. Andy Silvernail : Hey, Nathan. Nathan Jones : Hi Andy. Question here just on FMT and the impact that Banjo had in the quarter. I mean, you got pretty phenomenal order growth 110 basis points of margin expansion, and I think Banjo is one of the higher-margin businesses in there so it probably was a bit of a drag on margin expansion. Can you maybe talk about what the drive from Banjo was? You're getting pretty close to 30% operating margins now. Can we see that number breach this year? Andy Silvernail : Yes. So it was -- it's less than you might have thought. There is definitely some impact, but it's lessening we think for a couple of different reasons. Most importantly, the margin profile of the rest of FMT has closed some of the gap on the rest of -- relative to Banjo. So the mix impact isn't quite as big as you would think. And when it's all said and done you're talking about this a company that is sub-5% of IDEX sales. And so even if you look at it relative to FMT you're still talking about, what, 12% 14% of FMT business is that about right? So plus or minus. So it's not immaterial, but it's not that big a deal -- not as big as it would have been, say, five years ago. Nathan Jones : Okay. Then maybe -- you did talk about pockets of weakness in FMT and you've danced a little bit around what those are. Maybe you could give us some more details on which of the businesses or which end-markets that you're seeing that weakness in? Andy Silvernail : Yes. More generally, the pockets of real weakness across the company are around ag, are around semicon and in auto. Now the good part is, is we don't -- I mean, those -- all those things together are sub-10% of revenue for IDEX. So when all said and done, yes, there's pockets of weakness there. The bigger thing that I was referencing in my prepared remarks was around the volatility of day rates. And so, we've seen this in a couple of different periods, kind of, going into 2015, 2016 coming out of 2015, 2016 and then last summer. You start -- as you look at it, one kind of inflection, positive our negative, you kind of tend to see some of this volatility and, I think, that goes back to the earlier question that was asked about capital being held up. I think, if capital gets held up, the book-and-turn business tends to have more volatility in it and also projects get kicked out. So, I think, it's a combination of those things. The good new story here is, if you get some relief on that, I think, that volatility goes away and you inflect upwards. Nathan Jones : Okay. So going to 2015, 2016 and coming out of 2015, 2016, that volatility clearly resulted in a big downturn and a big upswing. I guess the volatility last summer didn't really move the needle in a big way one, way or the other. Andy Silvernail : I'd say, we're still -- Nathan, I would argue that we're in a six-month period. If I were to go back kind of the third quarter through the first quarter, I'd say it's been six months of that, right? We've had months that have been weak and months that have been very strong. And so, I think, we're still in that question mark zone. Nathan Jones : Okay. So you're still in the period of volatile day rates waiting to see whether that's going to sort itself out or jump off a cliff or inflect up, or something like that. Any sense from you of what you think is going to happen around that? Andy Silvernail : The issue, I think, is this isn't tied to normal economic activities. It's very big macro and political issues and so I don't have any idea. Nathan Jones : Fair enough. Fair enough. And I'm glad to stay in market and praise you there. All right. Thanks guys. Andy Silvernail : Thanks, Nathan. Bill Grogan : Thanks, Nathan. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Joe Giordano : Hey, guys. Good morning. Andy Silvernail : Hi, Joe. Joe Giordano : Hey. So some of like the higher-profile OEMs and some of the HST areas like on mass spec and chromatography, et cetera, talked about having -- it sounded like there was some buildup here in the channel perhaps. I'm just curious as to what you're seeing. I know its longer side -- sales cycle for you guys there. So what are you seeing relative to that? How temporary does that feel like for you guys? Andy Silvernail : Yes. So did see -- if you actually look at the life sciences piece itself that was actually pretty darn healthy. And so, we have not seen that play through. With the major customers, we have electronic Kanbans that are in place with all of them and so we have a pretty good visibility. How that might play through their supply chain -- their forward supply chain to their customers and back to us, we have less visibility on. But I don't think you're looking at something that's going to be a really big deal. Joe Giordano : Right. FSD, I mean, I guess, the pop-in order is probably -- is a bit surprising for most people. How sustainable do you think that it is? Is that a business, as a segment, that might be down organically this year, full year? Or how you kind of -- how do you call-in that now? Bill Grogan : No., I think, -- this is Bill. Overall, it's going to be up for the year. I think, there will be, again, quarter-to-quarter volatility for dispensing, right. Sales were down 15%, but orders were up 10%. We called on the fourth quarter we had something to push in the first quarter. We landed that order, but Fire & Rescue, really strong mid-single digit and just got the same expectations for BAND-IT. Andy Silvernail : Yes. Joe Giordano : And then just last from me. I mean, we've talked about day rate volatility a bit a bunch here. Andy, I know, that's something that really gets you kind of laser-focused. So how are you kind of -- when you're not sure which way it's going to break how do you kind of act? Do you kind of see -- think -- do you're going to get ready for one side or the other, or get actions in place that if it goes one way we're ready cap that? I know you hate getting behind that either, but just how are you... Andy Silvernail : We are as, I've said many, many times in the past we react much better to the upside than we do to the downside. And so, we can move pretty quickly as demand inflects upwards. And I'm happy to have to chase that a little bit. That's all right with me. The contribution margins are going to be high and you're really chasing it with supply chain and labor. And so, I can deal with that. Getting way out in front and having the markets turned over on you is very painful, right? Because now you're firing people and you've got a really difficult contribution margin on the backside where the decrementals become painful. So I'd rather be conservative going into that, I have to chase the upside a little than I would, getting out in front and having to dramatically react to the downside. Joe Giordano : That\u2019s fair. Thanks. Andy Silvernail : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Blair with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. Bryan Blair : Hi. Good morning, guys. Andy Silvernail : Hi, Bryan. Bryan Blair : Nice start to the year. Andy Silvernail : Thank you. Bryan Blair : I was hoping you could offer a little color on the SAM launch in Fire & Safety. I know, you literally just introduced to the market, but it seems like that's going to be a game-changing technology. Curious about initial reception? And whether it's already contributing to FSD order rate? Andy Silvernail : I appreciate the question, Bryan. So we had the North American fire show in Indianapolis here a few weeks ago and we introduced both, the SAM system and the new eDRAULIC tool. And, I think, it's fair to say that the SAM system had incredible reaction. The number of people at that booth, the reaction from customers has been terrific. We have already secured our first major customer around that. I don't want to talk about who at this time. And it's a big deal, right. We made that small acquisition -- technology acquisition last year. That was all about bringing the user interface and our ability to link all of our components into a singular system and it's really -- in terms of -- everyone was talking about IoT and digital and this is a great example of we're really on the forefront of that. And what's going to happen is over the course of years, we're going to change the productivity and the safety profile of a fire truck and that's a really big deal. Now that being said this is the stuff that happens really slowly and it happens slowly for two reasons. One there's already a year of backlog in the fire truck OEMs right. So things have all been ordered. So unless somebody wants to fundamentally change the nature of their order, it's going to take some time for that to go through the system. And then second, there's going to be conversion, right. You've got a huge installed base over time. But I think what happens is you're going to see this over the course of three to five years I believe we're going to start taking significant chunks of market share. We've got great intellectual property around this. And I do think it's a game changer for us. As you think about over a decade, our positioning in the fire market relative to this capability and how it pulls through complementary, it's a big deal. Bryan Blair : That's extremely helpful color. Thank you. And if we could follow-up a little on M&A. Obviously you have a lot of dry powder right now and good scale and diversification across platforms. With the resources you have in place is larger scale or more transformational M&A prospective going forward? Andy Silvernail : You know Bryan, we're pretty cautious about that. If you look at the universe of businesses that would be transformational. So let's say, our size to have our size, right. If you look at businesses of that scope and scale there are very few that fit naturally with IDEX. There are a handful and those are the things that we keep up on and we work on all the time. And there are a few that we could do that would be wonderful combinations with IDEX, but it's not very many. It has to be at the right price and you've got you be able to drive real synergies. That being said, as you look from say that size down to $300 million, $500 million or so call it $300 million to $1 billion in revenue, there's quite a bit of stuff out there. And it's really a matter of timing and being able to do a deal at the right kind of economics that fits our style of competition. And if that happens, we will move really quickly. We looked at a bunch year, we put a ton of effort into them and we just need to keep to our style of competition and the discipline around our return frameworks and not get seduced into doing mid single-digit ROIC deals that are \"accretive\" but are really disastrous to the capital structure and the return structure of the business over the long-term. And we're just not going to do that. Bryan Blair : Makes perfect sense. Thank you again. Andy Silvernail : Thanks, Bryan. Operator : There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing comments. Andy Silvernail : Thanks very much, and thank you everyone for joining us here on the first quarter call. More than anything else, I want to thank the teams here at IDEX who do just a tremendous job being laser-sharp focused on our customers, understanding that in a market like this we really do need to execute and execute well and they've done that. And then, discipline around how we spend this free cash flow. And so the teams, I'm very proud of the teams that we have and the culture that we've built. And I look forward to catching up with everybody in the next 90 days. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Michael Yates, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for IDEX Corporation. Thank you. You may begin. Michael Yates : Thank you, Melissa. Good morning, everyone. This is Mike Yates, I'm Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for IDEX Corporation. Let me start by saying thank you for joining us for a discussion of the IDEX second quarter financial highlights. Last night, we issued a press release outlining our Company's financial and operating performance for the three months ending June 30, 2019 and later today we will file our 10-Q.

Joining me today is Andy Silvernail, our Chairman and CEO; and Bill Grogan, our Chief Financial Officer. The format for our call today as follows : We will begin with Andy providing an overview and an update on market conditions, geographies, and our capital deployment. Bill then will discuss our second quarter financial results and walk you through our operating performance within each of our segments. And finally, Andy will wrap up with an outlook for the third quarter and the full-year 2019. Following these prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. If you should need to exit the call for any reason, you may access a complete replay beginning approximately two hours after the call concludes by dialing the toll-free number 877-660-6853 and entering conference ID 136-841-63 or you may simply log on to our Company's homepage for the webcast replay. Before we begin, a brief reminder, today\u2019s call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the Safe Harbor language in last night's press release and in IDEX's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I'll now turn our call over to our Chairman and CEO, Andy Silvernail. Andrew Silvernail : Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate you joining us to discuss our 2019 second quarter operating results. Let me start with a few summary points on the results. Q2 was solid and I'm very pleased with these performance in a choppy economic environment. Bill is going to walk you through some financial details in a bit, but overall we delivered 3% organic growth in the quarter, our 10th consecutive quarter of organic growth. The 3% was slightly below our expectations, but considering the lingering trade tensions and the uncertainty in the macro environment, I was happy with the result. Our price and productivity initiatives continue to drive outstanding margin and capital return regardless of commercial environment. We delivered another record EPS in the quarter. As we look at the balance of the year, we're confident in our ability to execute in times of volatility. As such, for raising the low end of our full-year guidance by $0.08, our guide is now $5.78 to $5.85 per share. Finally, before I go into details, I want to take a moment to welcome Velcora Holdings and its two product lines Roplan and Steridose to the IDEX family. We're very excited about the possibilities this acquisition brings to our Sealing Solutions platform and I'm confident the acquisition will prove to be a great addition to our portfolio. With that, let me start the call with the look at the regions we do business in. The overall global economic output remains uncertain. Companies are employing a wait-and-see approach and slowing down larger project activities as they wait for some resolution to the various geopolitical situations across the world. We believe that the underlying fundamentals in North America remains strong due to high levels of employment and expanding wages. Markets continue to grow, but at a slower rate versus the first quarter. In Asia, there are some pockets of strong performance, but the overall Asian economic performance decelerated due to uncertainty driven by the ongoing trade conflicts in China and the election cycle in India. Finally, the Eurozone was flat year-over-year. We see pressure in Germany as auto, tooling, and general industrial markets softened, given the apprehension in the UK as the future of Brexit is still unknown. All right, let me turn to the markets we serve. The industrial markets are generally performing well, driven by OEM and project wins. However, we're seeing softness in daily distribution orders and project closure timing is becoming harder to predict, despite the strong funnel. Demand continues to be robust across key life science markets. Strong performance continued to in IVD/BIO as our partnership with our customers continue to drive innovation and bring new products to market. The energy market is relatively flat with strong North American truck demand and good performance of commercial aviation offset by lower LPG project volume. U.S. ag, continues to be solid. Our overall farmer sentiment is low with continued tariff impacts and the challenging 2019 planting seasons. OEMs are reacting to the slowdown with an extended mid-year shutdowns. Municipal markets in North America remain stable. We see some slowness in Europe were political uncertainty is leading to project delays and the China markets are softening, but India remains strong. The semiconductor market continues to be driven down at high inventory levels and memory chips as well as lower consumer sales of smartphones. We do not expect this market to pick up in the back half of the year. Finally, the slowdown in global light vehicle sales drove softness in our automotive exposure, especially in China. Okay, let me switch to capital deployment. As I mentioned earlier, I'm very excited to welcome Velcora Holdings and the Roplan and Steridose product lines to the IDEX family. These businesses will mess nicely with our Sealing Solutions of portfolio, and we're confident at our current product offering. We deployed $137 million in capital on the deal to paid about 13x 2019 EBITDA. We expect the deal to achieve double-digit cash on cash returns in the near future. We're still working through the purchase accounting associated with the transaction, but we don't expect to deal to the material to a 2019 adjusted EPS. As usual or closely with their teams integrate the business in IDEX family, and we look forward to the long-term returns I'll provide. M&A continued to be a priority for us and the funnel remains strong. Our teams continue to evaluate several deals as we continue to look for high quality assets to that portfolio. In addition in the quarter, we were purchased $3 million of stock at an average purchase price of $155 and we returned $38 million to shareholders via dividends. With that, we pause here for a moment. I'll turn it over to Bill, who's now talk about the financial results and the segment discussion. William Grogan : Thanks, Andy. I'll start with our second quarter financial results on Slide 4. Q2 orders were $628 million were down 2% overall, the flat organically, each of the segments were flat year-over-year. I'll get into more detail and covering the segments, but I would say there are three main drivers for order performance. First, the softness we are seeing in ag, semi and auto impacted orders by about 150 basis points. Secondly, you unresolved trade conflict and continued geopolitical uncertainties are creating caution in the markets and we're seeing customers pause on large projects investment across the segments. And finally, we're comping back to back years of over 8% organic growth for the second quarter. Q2 revenue of $642 million was up 1% overall and 3% organically, driven by 3% organic growth across all segments. We expanded second quarter gross margins by 20 basis points to 45.5%, primarily due to price, volume leverage and production efficiencies, partially offset by continued investments in engineering related to new product development. Q2 adjusted operating margin was 24.5% and all-time quarterly high for IDEX and up 90 basis points compared with the adjusted prior year period, mainly driven by our gross margin expansion in lower SG&A costs. Q2 adjusted net income was $150 million resulting in record, high adjusted EPS of $1.50, up $0.10 or 7% over prior year adjusted EPS. Our second quarter effective tax rate was 21.7% same as prior year, but 80 basis points lower than our previously guided amount, primarily due to higher access tax benefit from greater than expected stock option exercises in the quarter. Free cash flow was solid at $118 million of 8% over the last year and 103% of adjusted net income. This was our highest Q2 free cash flow of all time. Finally, in regards to the balance sheet, gross and net debt leverage remain very healthy. The combination of our strong balance sheet, capacity on our revolver and free cash flow provides us the ability to deploy $2 billion in the next 12 months for the right M&A opportunities, while still maintaining our investment grading. I'll now turn to the segment discussion. I'm on Slide 5, starting with Fluid & Metering. Q2 orders were down 2% overall and flat organically, mainly driven by the market cautious sediment we mentioned earlier, market contraction in the ag market and lower projects and energy. Q2 sales were up 1% overall and up 3% organically. All businesses other than Banjo grew organically in the quarter. Despite some market choppiness in North American distribution, FMT continues to perform well overall driven by a successful targeted growth initiatives in the industrial space along with solid OEM demand as well as our ability to capitalize in the favorable chemical market conditions. Both our Viking and Richter businesses posted record sales for the second quarter in a row, driving strong growth in our pumps and valves businesses. The municipal water business remains steady and the oil and gas market conditions have stabilized a bit. As I mentioned before, the only business in this segment that contracted year-over-year was Banjo, which is impacted by the overall Ag market dynamics. We're keeping a close eye on preseason order patterns that generally occur in Q3 as an indicator to see if there is a chance for a rebound in 2020. Finally, excluding restructuring expense, operating margin was 30.5%, up 100 basis points over the adjusted prior year quarter, mainly due to price, volume, leverage and productivity initiatives, partially offset by higher engineering investments. Let's move on to Health Science turning to Slide 6. Q2 orders were down 1% overall, but flat organically, mainly driven by the market pressure in Semicon and automotive. From a sales perspective, Q2 sales were up 2% overall and 3% organically, driven by our strong performance across all segments of our life science business. As we continue to grow through targeted MPT efforts in collaboration with our key customers and leveraging strong secular growth trends. At gas, we continue to see project wins with our MPT launch in the food and beverage space, driving double-digit revenue expansion. In MPT, they have built a strong backlog driven by growth in the Pharma market and we look for them to have strong back half of the year. Finally, the unfavorable market conditions in Semicon and Auto negatively affected our sealing platform and created headwinds the overall sales and orders for the segment as sealing was down 18% in orders and 6% in sales organically for the quarter. From a margin perspective, excluding restructuring expenses, operating margin increased 100 basis points to 24.6%. This was primarily due to higher volume and lower amortization, partially offset by higher growth investments. I'm now moving on to our final segment diversified. I'm on Slide 7. Q2 orders were down 3% overall and flat organically, driven by a tough comp in dispensing due to a larger project order in the prior year. They were down 22% in orders for the quarter. Q2 revenues were flat overall, but up 3% organically and I'll provide more color on that in a minute. Operating margin of 27.1% decreased 100 basis points in the quarter. This was driven by dispensing as they delevered on their lower project volume. Sequentially, this segment was up 130 basis points versus Q1. Our FSD segments performance was mainly driven by solid results in our fire and safety businesses. On the fire side, we continue to capture OEM demand and our cast products are performing well and the launch of our SAM product is getting a lot of attention in the market. Within rescue, we are capitalizing on strong tool demand and seeing positive momentum around our MPT programs. Our hydraulic watertight tool that we launched at the beginning of the quarter is seeing high demand. At BAND-IT, its performance remained strong despite general softness in the auto market and lower industrial sales. However, we continue to win in the aerospace and several other niche verticals. Dispensing story remains challenging. As I mentioned earlier, the business was down double-digits compared to prior year due to a tough comp against some large project wins last year. We expect the business to be marginally better in the second half, but still down. There will continue to be a drag in the segment for the balance of the year. I'll now pass it back to Andy to provide an update on our 2019 guidance. Andrew Silvernail : Thanks Bill. So to wrap things up, let me summarize some additional details regarding our 2019 guidance for both the third quarter and the full-year. I'm on the last slide, Slide 8. In Q3, we're projecting EPS to be in the range of $1.45 to $1.47, organic revenue growth of approximately 3%, and op margin at about 24%. We are estimating a 1% topline headwind from FX, assuming the June 30 rates, which translates into $0.01 impact of EPS. Q2 effective tax rate should be about 22.5% and we expect to spend about $20 million in corporate costs. If you look at the full-year for 2019 again, we're raising the low end of our full-year EPS guidance $0.08, our new guidance is $5.78 to $5.85. Full-year organic revenue is projected to be 3% to 4% and op margin again about 24%. And the same with the next quarter, we expect the total FX impact as June 30 rates to be 1%. The full-year effective tax rates should be about 21.5%. We're expecting to spend about $60 million in CapEx, free cash flow should be about 105% of net income, and corporate costs should be in the $78 million to $80 million range. As always, our earnings guidance excludes any associated costs with future acquisitions or restructuring. With that, operator let's turn it over to questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Andrew Silvernail : Hi, Deane. Deane Dray : Maybe we should start with the macro since that seems to be where most of the uncertainty is. And Andy, we were with you last at EPG and you were clearly signaling at that time, you were seeing choppy daily orders and that seems to have come through in the results today. Couple of questions to start with. What was the cadence of the quarter? You've heard a lot of different commentary from the company's about the months in the quarter. So how did that progresses you? And then some color on the distribution side, sell-in and sell-through? Andrew Silvernail : Yes. So the overall cadence was different Deane than we've been experiencing here for the last year. I think in several conversations that I've had with people, I've noted that in the past year, maybe year and a half, we've seen this cycle in the quarter where you've had \u2013 have a weak month, and maybe a slightly better month and then a relatively strong month. That's been the pattern here for quite some time. And the pattern was different. For the first time, we didn't see that ramp up in the last month of the quarter. I will say that the early part of July is stable, right. So you're not seeing a decline in any time, which I think is positive. But you didn't see that uptick in the last month of the quarter like we have seen in the past. And so, I think that really notes well to a decelerating environment, which is what we're experiencing certainly from last year, first quarter to this year. So frankly, no surprise, it's kind of what we've been expecting here for some time. I think we've tried to do a good job of communicating that and I think we're in the environment that we expected to be here coming into the year. Deane Dray : And the view from the distributor sell-in and sell-through? Andrew Silvernail : Unlike a lot of folks, we don't have a lot of off-the-shelf distribution. We do have some, it's been fine. We don't see any major areas of stocking or destocking. I think that the biggest thing relative to folks is, they're very cautious, whether it's in the distribution network or the OEMs, people are pretty cautious about anything with the big ticket. And so I think we're going to see that until you get some certainty back into the marketplace. The interesting thing about it is it doesn't feel like it's driven by what I'll call fundamental demand of under capacity or overcapacity, which is typically what happens. This really feels a manmade. And so the encouraging part of that is did you get some resolution on some of these things, I think demand snaps back pretty quickly. I think the discouraging part of it is, it doesn't really look like that's going to happen anytime in the near future. Deane Dray : Yes. That\u2019s really helpful. And just kind of extend the manmade observation, it's manmade and not execution. And that's pretty clear to us. And just last question for me, and if there's ever a time to be asking this, it's now your barometer business. You always BAND-IT, Warren Rupp and gas, and BAND-IT looks like it's holding up versus even with auto being weak and gas had a good quarter. So take us through the barometers. Andrew Silvernail : It's a mixed bag. What I would say is on the daily rate business, you definitely see softness. BAND-IT and gas in particular have actually won nice chunks of business, but there are larger chunks of business that had been part of our targeted growth list. Warren Rupp is actually holding in. And so if I look across the board, it's a mixed bag, all in all equally in deceleration. Deane Dray : Terrific. Really good color. Thank you. Andrew Silvernail : Thanks Deane. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak-Cusic with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Allison Poliniak-Cusic: Hi, guys. Good morning. Andrew Silvernail : Good morning. Allison Poliniak-Cusic: Can we go back to Health & Science orders, I think Bill you said, the semi and auto part was putting pressure about, I think it was down 18% in orders. Can you talk to maybe the life science and MPT and some of what the order trends you're seeing on that side? William Grogan : Yes. So life science is really solid and no concerns there. The MPT has a very good funnel of work, they've been working on, Allison, as well as anyone that's pretty lumpy, but generally, it's a good funnel of work they have there. The concerns are all around semiconductor and auto, the Sealing business you said 18 down, that was a Sealing business in particular. And that they have our largest chunk of semiconductor exposure. So they're facing some headwinds, they\u2019re semi and auto. And so they're facing some headwinds there, but really good execution and most of the Sealing platform, which is nice to see. So I think those are just part of those cyclical markets generally, otherwise very happy with the profit expansion that we saw in HST that's a record for us. And I know this time last year we had some questions about whether or not we were going to expand margins at the same time of click that we had in other parts of the company. And I think we've demonstrated that we can do that. And I think the life science stuff is in really good shape. Allison Poliniak-Cusic: Great. And then can we just touch on Velcora's, a little bit more color on there. Just in terms of growth rate margin? Is it leveraged to any significant customers that we need to be mindful of? Andrew Silvernail : Yes. So first of all, and this is a terrific business. We've known about this business for a long time. But we cultivated the business ourselves. It's a wonderful thing principally road plan, which is that the 85% of business is a mechanical Sealing business. A lot of exposure into faster growing parts of the market into life sciences and just generally good positioning across the board, the businesses is profitable, it's an eidetic like business and we think quite a bit offside frankly. It's a well-run company that really terrific team of people, but we think not unlike when we bought PPE back here quite some time ago and nine years ago now, that business, the margins have I think more than double that PPE in a period of time. Probably won't do that, but there's a lot of upside in terms of profit and growth rates. William Grogan : And not heavily concentrated across a small group of customers. Andrew Silvernail : Yes. So it's life science, food and beverage and then general industrial. Allison Poliniak-Cusic: Great. Thank you. Andrew Silvernail : You bet Allison. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Halloran with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Michael Halloran : Hey, good morning, everyone. Andrew Silvernail : Good morning, Mike. Michael Halloran : So just a quick tack on to that, what's the accretion embedded in the guidance associated with the acquisition? William Grogan : Nothing as of now, we're still working through final purchase accounting. We'll give guidance once we complete that come out of the third quarter, but nothing material, maybe a penny or two or most. Michael Halloran : Okay. So then \u2013 on the acquisition M&A commentary very strong robust pipeline. Maybe you could talk a little bit about actionability. I know that's been a hurdle in the past. It's on a little bit more constructive. Andrew Silvernail : Yes, so it's, look we've talked about here for quite some time. We've been working on a ton of stuff and walked away from a lot of things. So it's the pipeline looks good. We've got a bunch of things that we're working on. Actionability is very hard to estimate. In this environment we found time and again that you've had people who have been willing to pay, kind of an exorbitant price at the end of a discussion. The quarter was terrific because we were the only ones in there at a very constructive long-term conversation going on and was in an auction, the rest of the environment frankly, is unchanged from when we talked about it 90 days ago Mike. Michael Halloran : All right, makes sense. And then just from a guidance perspective, understanding how you get to that 3% to 4% range, obviously orders, 3%-ish plus or minus starting the year here. When you look to the back half of the year, is this about comps easing where the time you hit the fourth quarter that that helps get to that range? Is it about the cadence that you're expecting from an end market perspective? Maybe just give some puts and takes and how you get to that 3% based on the environment today and then whether or not there's continued deceleration in the environment embedded in that assumption? Andrew Silvernail : We don't have anything competitive in terms of further deceleration. We have not estimated that basically at the levels that we're at today. We kind of take it in straight line and that's what it is. It's the fourth quarter that we have a much easier cost. The second, third quarter is a tougher comps, a fourth quarters, a significantly easier comp. There's no significant change. There's no one major inflection that has to happen for us to get to these numbers. Michael Halloran : That makes sense. I appreciate it. William Grogan : Q2 is the larger order. We decelerate a little bit just for the seasonality in Q3. So to your point, flat orders at a larger number yielding into Q3 is not straight math. Michael Halloran : I appreciate that Bill. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Nathan Jones : Good morning, everyone. Just maybe following onto Mike's question and your answer to that, I mean it sounds like you're \u2013 the back half off of the year guidance embed normal seasonality, not getting better, not getting worse, largely across the portfolio. Maybe you could talk about the things that could make it get worse, could make it gets better, relative to what your current expectation is? Andrew Silvernail : Yes. I wish I had a brilliant answer for you, Nathan. I think it's all the macro, frankly. We're going to work our body of product and customer opportunities and continue to push for our consistent 200 bps above market. I think is all going to depend upon the global economy. I'm not sure that we're going to swing at one way or the other, meaningfully off our current trajectory different than that. Nathan Jones : Fair enough. Maybe on margins particularly FMT in case anybody missed it, I think you crossed 30% margins there for the first time, so congrats on that. Is that the kind of level that you guys think you can maintain there? What businesses in that segment have the opportunity to improve margins a bit more? If we're starting to slowing growth there, should we expect to see incrementals dropping to that kind of 30 to 35 range? I think you expect when you're seeing lower growth here. And does that mean we should see margins flatten out year? Andrew Silvernail : Yes. So I think at the current volume levels that we're at, I'm not \u2013 I think we're about at the right level of profitability. On an increase in volume, you've still got headroom here, because of the very high incrementals. At the end of the good part here is, we have \u2013 we don't have a huge mix of margin. We have some margin mix here, but we've got a lot of businesses that are now kind of pushing up against this higher 20s number. So assuming that the world that fall apart on us, that margin will feels pretty good. At the same time, we've all got to be candid. This is a very high contribution margin business and if the business turns down, it's going to have a steep dropdown. That's just the way it is. We have continued to plans that we've talked about before on these calls. And it's why we have been cautious in some degree about our market outlook. And so my point of view is we're a very healthy margin level now. We have further incrementals and FMT and in other parts of the business, based on the high contribution margins and our ability to get priced. And we are preparing as we always do, if we have softening to make sure we're appropriately, resetting the business and taking out some costs in line with volume. Nathan Jones : You guys have always made it pretty clear that you have those kinds of contingency plans for economic downturns. Are there businesses now where you actually need to enact some of those plans? Are they places where you need to take costs out currently with where the economy is? Andrew Silvernail : Yes, definitely. If you look across the 40 businesses, if you look at the folks who are more focused on auto, semi, ag, you absolutely have got to do that. And they've been doing that here since basically this time last year, in one way or the other. Just from a process standpoint and we're looking at this \u2013 number one, we're looking at this all the time. We'd go into any year, having a contingency plan that's very, very specific and I know I've said this in many venues before, but just the high level math of this whole thing. Our broader contingency plan is one that says, okay with the what I call, vanilla recession. We think the topline is down five points plus or minus, right? And that five points is equal do about $125 million unmitigated, that's going to be about $75 million in pretax profits. And we think that we can take out and not damage the business somewhere in that $20 million range pretty quickly. A bunch of it's volume related, a bunch of it services related, right size in certain places that have a larger overall impact. The end up with downside of call it somewhere between $50 million and $60 million. So $0.50 to $0.60 a share and so what that's kind of 8%, downside on a 5% in a topline downside. And that's the mentality that we've had and obviously as you move into the businesses, the contingency plans look different than that and not everybody is the same. But that's our mindset. And so as we things decelerated here, I mean, I don't \u2013 I'm not going to call it a recession, but we're prepared if that happens and we'll pull the trigger on things and some things make into your point. We are pulling the trigger on now, the small things that are being hit specifically with the volume declines. Bill, anything you wanted to add there? William Grogan : Yes. I was going to highlight, we did take a couple of restructure actions in the quarter on those businesses that are seeing fundamental softness. So we continue to evaluate and as businesses underperform take action. Nathan Jones : That's helpful color. Thanks a lot guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question. Matt Summerville : Thanks. Two questions. First, just on the quarter, where were you in terms of price realization year-over-year and how did that compare to the inflationary pressure you're seeing in your businesses. William Grogan : We continue to trend is that little over a point of price capture and at the high end of our historical price costs spread, about 30 to 40 basis points historically a little on the higher end here in the second quarter. Andrew Silvernail : The team has done a super job with price and managing the spread and to build a point, we're on a little above our higher end that 30 to 40, which is good. Matt Summerville : And then with respect to the HST overall, may be to an earlier comment, Andy. At this point, do you feel like that business is breaking into a new sort of higher level of margin potential? And can you maybe talk about, what areas you still can see sort of material improvement from here with the platforms that are currently in the HST portfolio? Andrew Silvernail : Yes. So I'm actually really, really proud of that team. We're at our record op margin there with Sealing down 18% with a pretty high incremental margins in that business. So when you set Sealing aside and you look at what the performance is of the rest of the business, it's pretty extraordinary and actually I\u2019ll get the Sealing team a lot of credit managing that downside. They actually manage the cost structure really well too. So that's a good note. So I think we're in a good position. I\u2019m line in it a little bit. If you went back to 2015, 2016. One of the things you guys couldn't see because the industrial businesses were getting kind of kicked around is we were in the process of restructuring a number of businesses within FMT. And that breakout and profitability that we've had here in the last 2 years, 2.5 years was about that, right? We have reset the margin structure of the business and when volume came back, you've now see what has happened to profitably at FMT. I don't think HST has that much upside. I'm not going to say that, but I think what you're seeing with us having a record with a key piece of the business being down and the fact that they're holding margin. When you see that pick back up, I think that bodes well for improvement in the overall HST margin structure in the future. William Grogan : Yes, we did two plant consolidations with an HST in two, one with an MPT and one within the life science space. So there were some structural actions, I think to help us get it. Matt Summerville : Yes. William Grogan : And to this point to add Andy's comment probably not hugely increases going forward, more relations \u2013 yes it's that. Andrew Silvernail : One thing to note, Matt and everyone should pay attention to this. Velcora is going to land into HST. They're bringing some amortization there. It's a little bit \u2013 the margins are a little bit lower than the HST average anyway. And so you will see some dilution on that as we go forward a little bit. Matt Summerville : Thanks you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Brett Linzey : Hey, good morning, guys. Andrew Silvernail : Good morning, Brett. Brett Linzey : Hey, just wanting to come back to incremental margins and really thinking about the Q3 framework and the implicit in Q4. If you just look at incrementals, at the midpoint, it does imply incrementals that are just naturally above what those businesses typically do? Are you throttling back some investment spending, or is it just some of that price cost benefit you're going to see here in the second half? Any color there? Andrew Silvernail : We are not throttling back investment spending at all. You're going to see \u2013 we're going to hit that $60 million number for CapEx. As I've mentioned to you before, they're kind of 25 major programs or projects that myself, Bill and Eric Ashleman and then the rest of the team really focusing on and we are funding those. There are some places that are in cyclical downturns that we're pulling back. But in our places that we're betting \u2013 we're continuing to \u2013 into that. And one of the things that I'm really intent on and we're having \u2013 one of the reasons I'm so straightforward with you guys about what we're going to do if there's a downturn and it's exactly the conversation we're having with our Board because if you get the scenario that I outlined before, what I don't want to do is go and take another $10 million or $20 million out because with that you will cut throttled down investment. And if you have a recession that's six or 12 months, the last thing we want to do is might go a bunch of really critical people that you wont be able to hire back in this tight environment in the future. So I want to invest that $10 million or $20 million, so we can continue that to have better than market growth rates. So we're keeping going and we're going to trim back on places that are weaker. But we're going to keep investing. William Grogan : And I think our price capture helps enable that. Andrew Silvernail : Yes, absolutely. Brett Linzey : Okay, good. And then I guess just a follow-up to that. Specific to just restructuring, you did a little less than $4 million in the first half, I think $12 million in 2018. Do you expect this step that up in the second half for the year here? Andrew Silvernail : Yes, I think you'll see a few more things happen here that that we've been seeing up. But unless things materially weaken, I think it will be maybe a little bit higher, but it's not going to be a breakout number. Brett Linzey : Okay, good. And then just the last question, regarding the channel. Maybe you could just compare and contrast what you're seeing in distribution versus direct in OE specific to orders. How did that look in the quarter and then really into July here? Thanks. Andrew Silvernail : I'll have Bill comment on this, it sounds too. He's done a lot of work in this area, but there are two things that were different in the second quarter on the orders front then in the first quarter. The first thing is that larger projects and we've seen this pattern for the last eight years, since I've been CEO. We see this pattern happen with when the softening kicks in, the larger scale stuff gets pushed out and you started to see that happen. That was one thing we have seen kind of larger projects get delayed. And then secondarily, what we saw happen in the throughout the quarter was the day rate business in some of these very short cycle businesses came down. And so that's what kind of played out. The good news is again, July has held up that if you're not seeing a sequential decline anymore, which is a good thing. But you are seeing a little bit lower level than if you compare it to the first quarter or the fourth quarter of last year in terms of the order book. Brett Linzey : Okay, good. I appreciate the color? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Joh. Berenberg. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Buscaglia : Hey guys. Can you talk a little bit about, so you mentioned you made the comment that some of this is \u2013 sluggishness is man-made? But have mind suggest with semiconductors and auto and even ag, I would say that could be a prolonged decline. So trying to triangulate what you're seeing maybe are too niche to be impacted by that. But what is your comment on that. William Grogan : Well, maybe one comment. The corollary we saw in May when there was a tweet around potential tariffs with Mexico, our industrial business saw immediate response in reduction in day rates. So that corollary around this being not fundamental economics versus caution in the broader economy is somewhat of what we're basing at early on. Andrew Silvernail : Yes. And also \u2013 and you recognized that auto, semi, ag and total is 12% of the business, 10% of the business. William Grogan : Yes, we are less. Andrew Silvernail : Yes. So you've got to recognize it that I'm referring to basically 90% of the business that is not bad stuff. And so as you look, if you break down life sciences, you break down municipal, you break down general, industrial, that's more of what I'm referencing. And look, if we couldn't see that \u2013 Bill described, if you couldn't see that corollary between those things and how fast that happens, it's really remarkable. And back to the question that I got earlier about our canary businesses, we saw those in particular, I mean, if you snap your finger and as you get good news, bad news out of some of these trade and economic issues, we see it show up in our order book really quickly. Andrew Buscaglia : Okay. And then maybe just a more specific one within Health & Science technologies, one of your larger customers, Illumina had a weak quarter, did you guys look into that as anything concerning there given that they're kind of a barometer for what you do in biotech? Andrew Silvernail : Yes. So we're super careful about commenting on any customers. I think what I would say, and this is a broader statement \u2013 sometimes people forget what we sell into these marketplaces and we're selling components that are going into instruments. And a lot of these businesses you see some of their outsized impact, positive or negative is really their reagents. And so the key to look at for us is our growth versus instrument sales. And what I can say very broadly throughout the marketplace is we track well and I would say take incremental share. And that's a broader statement than any one customer. Andrew Buscaglia : Okay. All right. Thanks very much. Andrew Silvernail : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Joe Giordano with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. This is Robert in for Joe. I just wanted to go back to [indiscernible] trajectory that we saw in Q2, is that slowing down. Would now be the time to start to think about the possibility of orders start to turn negative going forward. Could you provide any color on that? Andrew Silvernail : I don't think so. Robert, the information that we have thus far wouldn't suggest that. But with that being said, let's just, I mean I think all of us are looking at this environment the same way. It is materially slowed sequentially. I think that the risk of recession has absolutely gone up, there's no doubt about that. But we have not seen any evidence of that as yet. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Silvernail for any final comments. Andrew Silvernail : Thanks, Melissa. I appreciate that. Thank you to all of you for joining us on the call today. Once again, very proud of the work that the team has done in this pretty choppy environment. The levels of execution, the levels of focus on the areas that matter most to us and really building the culture of this company to continue to perform regardless of environment is what we have worked very hard to do. And so I appreciate your time and I look forward to talking to you again here throughout the quarter and then in the next 90 days. Take care. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the IDEX Corporation Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Michael Yates, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer. Thank you, Mr. Yates. You may begin. Michael Yates : Thank you, Doug. Good morning, everyone. This is Mike Yates, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for IDEX Corporation. Let me start by saying thank you for joining us for our discussion of the IDEX third quarter financial highlights.  Last night, we issued a press release outlining our company's financial and operating performance for the 3 months ending September 30, 2019. And later today, we will file our 10-Q. The press release, along with presentation slides to be used during today's webcast, can be accessed on our company's website at www.idexcorp.com.  Joining me today is Andy Silvernail, our Chairman and CEO; and Bill Grogan, our Chief Financial Officer. The format for our call is as follows : we will begin with Andy providing an overview of our operating performance in the quarter, Bill will then discuss our third quarter financial results and walk you through the operating performance within each of our segments. And finally, Andy will wrap up with an outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2019. Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call for your questions.  If you should need to exit the call for any reason, you may access a complete replay beginning approximately two hours after the call concludes by dialing the toll-free number 877-660-6853 and entering conference ID 13684164, or you may simply log on to our company's homepage for the webcast replay. Before we begin, a brief reminder. This call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbor language in the last night's press release and in IDEX' filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  With that, I'll now turn this call over to our Chairman and CEO, Andy Silvernail. Andrew Silvernail : Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everybody. I appreciate you joining us to discuss our 2019 third quarter operating results. In the challenging macro environment, I'm extremely proud of my team. As you know, I've had concerns about the overall demand volatility and the potential for further erosion. We have a short-cycle business. We go into any given quarter with only about 50% of the quarter booked. We were prepared. We got ahead of the challenges, and we're executing.  In the quarter, team delivered outstanding margin expansion, hitting all-time highs for gross margin and operating margin. The healthy margin expansion helped us deliver another record quarter of adjusted EPS, and we reduced working capital to drive another record quarter of free cash flow. The results were achieved in a decelerating commercial environment. Organic sales were flat in the quarter. The global demand for industrial products definitely weakened in the third quarter with manufacturing decontracting for the first time since 2016, and we're certainly feeling it. Lingering trade tensions and uncertain trade policy have weighed on global growth with customers and business leaders hesitant to spend. This has led to a slowdown in most geographies.  With that said, we remain confident in our ability to thrive in this environment. We're executing the playbook we've spoken about to you all year. We're being prudent about costs, and we're focusing on productivity while continuing to invest aggressively in our exceptional long-term growth prospects.  We've built IDEX to perform throughout a cycle, and we're doing the things that make IDEX different. We're investing in great teams who focus on the critical few priorities within our outstanding businesses, all of which is in service to our customers. This is what separates IDEX from our competition and allows us to deliver for our customers, employees and shareholders regardless of the macro environment. We're fortunate that our durable, diversified business model produces exceptional free cash flow, and we have an outstanding balance sheet. These facts allow us to have abundant capital to both invest aggressively in organic growth and drive returns through capital deployment.  Let me take a moment to talk about capital deployment before turning it over to Bill for some color on the financial results. The integration of Velcora is going extremely well, and the teams are delivering on the key value drivers. And as we get inside the business, I'm even more excited about the possibilities that Velcora brings to our Sealing platform. M&A continues to be a top focus for us but remains a challenge in the current environment due to valuation. Our teams are hard at work on both the cultivation and evaluation of several deals. With nearly $2 billion of capacity based on existing cash, availability under our revolver and a very healthy balance sheet, we have the capacity to support the right opportunities while remaining disciplined within our return framework. We will only move forward on a deal when the target fits the IDEX criteria.  Along with the acquisition of Velcora, we returned $38 million to shareholders via dividends in the quarter.  With that, let me pause here, and Bill, I'll turn it to you for a discussion on financial results and the segment details. William Grogan : Great. Thanks, Andy. I'll start with our third quarter financial results on Slide 4. Q3 orders of $586 million were down 5%, both overall and organically, driven by softness across all segments and tough comps versus last year. Q3 sales of $624 million were flat overall and organically. We did see growth in FMT and HST, but it was offset by a decline in FSD that was primarily driven by project timing.  We expanded gross margins in the quarter by 20 basis points to 45.2%. However, excluding the $3 million fair value inventory step-up charge related to the Velcora acquisition, adjusted gross margin was at an all-time high of 45.7%, up 70 basis points. This was primarily due to strong price capture and productivity initiatives partially offset by continued investments in engineering related to new product development. Q3 operating margin was 22.7%, but adjusting for both the fair value inventory step-up and restructuring expenses, adjusted operating margin was 25.2%, an all-time quarterly high for IDEX and up 120 basis points compared with the adjusted prior year period mainly driven by our gross margin expansion and lower SG&A costs, which were driven by decreased variable compensation expenses and tighter cost controls across the business. Included in the restructuring charges was an approximate $10 million impairment charge related to the wind down of a small business line within HST.  Our Q3 adjusted effective tax rate was 19.1%, which was lower than the 20.3% in the prior year period mainly due to changes in U.S. Treasury regulations as well as the mix of global pretax income among our jurisdictions. The adjusted ETR of 19.1% was also 340 basis points lower than our previously guided ETR due to a higher excess tax benefit from greater-than-expected stock option exercises as well as a favorable impact from the 2018 income tax return to provision adjustment. This lower ETR provided $0.06 of EPS favorability in our quarterly results compared to our previous guide back in July. Q3 adjusted net income was $117 million, resulting in a record adjusted EPS of $1.52, up $0.11 or 8% over prior year adjusted EPS. Finally, free cash flow was very strong at $146 million. It was up 28% over last year and 125% of adjusted net income. This was our highest free cash flow of all time.  I'll now turn to the segment discussion. I'm on Slide 5, starting with Fluid & Metering. Q3 orders were down 1% overall and flat organically mainly driven by softening demand in the industrial market and continued declines in agriculture. Q3 sales were up 1% overall and up 2% organically, attributable to the growth in our pumps, valves and energy businesses due to strong performance around our targeted growth initiatives but partially offset by the slowdown in the industrial short-cycle book-and-turn activity during the quarter. The municipal water business remains solid with stable spending projected for the remainder of '19.  In regards to the agriculture market, the market dynamics remain unchanged due to continued tariff pressures and depressed commodity prices, which has put pressure on the Banjo business all year. Preseason orders are flat compared to prior year period, and we are not forecasting any near-term change to the U.S. agriculture market performance. Finally, operating margin was outstanding at 32.2%, up 270 basis points over the adjusted prior year quarter mainly due to a widening price cost spread driven by the team's ability to continually capture value for their products and deliver on their productivity initiatives. FMT really executed during the quarter.  Let's move on to Health & Science, turning to Slide 6. Q3 orders were down 4% overall and 6% organically mainly driven by continued market pressure in semicon and automotive as well as the industrial slowdown impacting about 1/3 of the sales in HST that are industrially exposed. Orders were also impacted by timing as a few large life science blankets got pushed into the fourth quarter. From a sales perspective, Q3 sales were up 3% overall and 1% organically driven by strength in the life science business as they continue to experience growth tied to new product development and collaboration with our key customers.  At Gast, we continue to see MPT project wins, but as discussed earlier, we started to see challenging market conditions in the third quarter due to weakened North American industrial distribution demand. For MPT, strong results in Q3 were driven by shipments of some long lead time projects, reversing the negative trend we experienced in the first half of the year. We're seeing positive momentum within key pharma markets, and our commercial funnel continues to grow. Expectations are to deliver positive growth for the year.  Finally, within Sealing, pressure across the semiconductor, industrial and auto markets continue. Although we're beginning to see signals of reaching the bottom of the semi decline, their orders and sales are still challenged. From a margin perspective, excluding the fair value inventory step-up charge and restructuring expenses, operating margin increased 30 basis points to 23.8%. This was primarily due to the higher volume and price capture partially offset by higher growth investments and amortization related to the Velcora acquisition.  I'm now moving to our final segment, Diversified. I'm on Slide 7. Q3 orders were down 10% overall and 9% organically mainly driven by pressure on the projects side of the business as customers remain cautious around making large investments, as well as tough comps in dispensing and rescue to large project orders in the prior year period. Both dispensing and rescue orders were down over 20% organically in the quarter. Q3 revenues were down 5% overall and 3% organically, and I'll provide a little bit more color on that in a minute. Adjusted operating margin of 27.2% decreased 50 basis points in the quarter. This was mainly due to the reduced project volume. Sequentially, the segment was up 10 basis points versus the second quarter.  FSD's performance was mainly driven by the following : on the fire side, core OEM and municipal markets continue to perform well. We're experiencing steady growth across our product offerings as well as continued momentum around our new SAM product launch. Turning to rescue. Sales declined mainly due to project delays associated with political uncertainty, coupled with a tough comp from the prior year period. U.S. performance was slow due to a delay in FEMA spending, but expectations are that we'll see a rebound in the fourth quarter. BAND-IT performance remained strong based on wins with our targeted growth initiatives. Even as we see general softness in the auto and energy markets and pressure within the industrial space, BAND-IT continues to take share and grow in these areas. Finally, dispensing story remains similar to the first half of the year due to a tough comp against some large project wins in 2018 with no new projects occurring this year. As such, the business was down double digits compared to prior year, but we do expect to cycle back to growth in 2020.  I will now pass it back to Andy to provide an update on our 2019 guidance. Andrew Silvernail : Thanks, Bill. So let me wrap things up, and I'll provide some details here regarding 2019 for both the fourth quarter and the full year. I'm on the last slide, that's Slide 8.  In Q4, we're projecting EPS to be in the range of $1.33 to $1.35 with flat organic revenue. Operating margin should be about 23.5%. We're estimating about a $0.01 top line headwind from FX based on the September 30 rates. This translates to about $0.01 on the bottom line EPS headwind. The Q4 effective tax rate should be about 22%, and corporate costs in the fourth quarter will be around $18 million.  If we look at the full year 2019, we're projecting full year EPS of $5.80 million to $5.82. Full year organic revenue is projected to be about 2% with operating margins at approximately 24%. We should have about a 2% headwind from FX based on the September 30 rates. The effective tax rate for the year to be about 20.5%. CapEx is anticipated to be about $55 million, and free cash flow should be about 105% of net income. And finally, corporate costs will be about $73 million for the year.  As always, these earnings guidance expectations excludes anything from acquisitions or restructuring. With that, Doug, let me turn it over to you, and we'll open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Robert W. Baird. Michael Halloran : So let's start with the underlying trajectory, what you're seeing right now. Lots of puts and takes in the order numbers. SMT is flattish, which is typically a more cyclically sensitive business. The other pieces had some project timing related things. So maybe you could just talk about what you're seeing as like the core underlying demand characteristics today. What that trajectory looks like through the fourth quarter? And then maybe some puts and takes on how you're looking at growth for 2020. Andrew Silvernail : Sure. So Mike, first of all, good question. That's the biggest one that's on our minds. If -- you do have to kind of separate out the puts and takes, and this is the way I do it : you've got some project timing issues, meaning last year, we had an exceptionally strong third quarter if you look at rescue and dispensing, and those are some pretty good-sized numbers. And then in -- last year, we got some larger orders in our life science blanket orders that we typically get that we're going to get in the fourth quarter. If you take those 3 things and you neutralize those 3 things and you look at the underlying run rate of the business, it's basically flat to down 1%. It's about 0.5% if you just kind of look at the underlying day rate businesses, and I think that's pretty consistent with what we've seen.  And so as we get into the fourth quarter, I think you'll see some other puts and takes around there with that day rate business. What we've seen in early October or in October so far is basically kind of meeting our expectations of where we went into the quarter. And so I think we're kind of holding at this flattish to down 1% right now in -- on the core order rate of the businesses. So I don't see a reason for that trajectory right now to change meaningfully as we go out.  Now that being said, we have an easier comp in the fourth quarter versus what you saw last year, and then you got 2 pretty tough comps in the first and the second quarter of next year. So if you assume that you don't get a change in trajectory, I think that kind of flattish revenue growth in the fourth quarter feels about right. And then you'll face some tougher comps in the second -- first and second quarter with that getting easier in the third and the fourth quarter of next year. That's kind of how we're looking at it. Look, it's early to call 2020 based on our short-cycle nature of our business. What I would say, the first pass, that looks like a tougher first half, easier second half, balanced out with somewhere in a range of, I want to say, plus 2% to negative 2%. That's what that feels like right now. But again, really early on. We're in the process of tightening up our 2020 annual plans, but that's what the first pass kind of looks like, Mike. Michael Halloran : No. That makes a lot of sense. And then on the margin side, very strong execution this quarter. Walk through any puts and takes you think that might help us on a forward basis to figure out sustainability at this level. Were there -- anything on the incentive comp that's different? Any other kind of one-off things that would move this around one way or another? William Grogan : No. Yes, I think overall, obviously, with the revised results for the full year, there's a decrease in some of the variable compensation stuff. I think fundamentally, obviously, FMT's margins were really strong. That's where we're going to see probably the most decline is if we are in this industrial softness here recently, and they'll delever probably more than the other businesses. So that'll put more pressure. I think for the third quarter, we guided around 23.5%, which is probably what you'd see going forward at a consistent revenue run rate. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Andy, I appreciate that you made the comment that you were signaling that there was slowing going on. In fact, you were among the first senior guys back at the EPG Conference in May to say a slowing was happening. So as -- so no one should be blindsided by this. But as you -- orders inflect negatively here, what -- and I know you're short cycle, but you talked about customers hesitating to spend. What's the discussion at the margin right now in terms of committing -- willingness to commit capital? The order rates as they look in the fourth quarter? Are we going to stay negative? Or is it worsening versus the way we started the third quarter? Andrew Silvernail : I don't see right now, Deane, that it's worsening, but let me kind of back up and talk a little bit about the hesitancy. And like you said, we talked about it publicly at EPG. The -- as you look at this, the issue at hand is that there's just a real hesitancy based on the uncertainty in the marketplace, right? There's no -- there aren't kind of big demand bubbles, meaning negative issues that things are kind of imploding outside of what I've talked about in the past, these kind of human-made issues that are around the world. But what that's doing is it's reverberating back and people are just hesitant to spend, they're hesitant to hire. We are seeing more layoffs in the manufacturing sector than we've seen here in quite some time. And so I think this world of uncertainty, unfortunately, doesn't -- isn't likely to revolve -- resolve itself anytime soon, right? So you've got the constant back and forth regarding trade tensions that are out there. The folks who seem to -- with anybody who knows what's going on, the folks who spend a lot of time on this are very doubtful that any meaningful positive improvement happens, except for maybe a standoff, right? So it just doesn't get worse. So you've got that. And then really, as you get into the election cycle next year, these are not areas of our expertise, but in terms of talking to people out in the field, people are holding off as long as they can to commit large chunks of money into either hiring or into capital in really uncertain times. So my view is that it's going to be bumpy here for quite some time. Deane Dray : All right. So the macro commentary is really helpful, but let's pivot now into your end markets. And if we just go back to the second quarter when we talked about where the softening was showing up, it was auto, it was semicon, it was ag for you guys. And that was like 10% of the portfolio. It really does sound like that's still the kind of ground zero of where you're seeing the slowing. Has that spread to these -- any other verticals? Andrew Silvernail : Yes. I think that's the change in the third quarter. And if you remember, that was what I said I was concerned about was you've seen those 3 continue to struggle and then you've seen the industrial start to come down, right? FMT, which is 2/3 of our industrial exposure or 1/2 our industrial exposure, you can see, although it's still good relative to what I think the rest of the world is experiencing, you're definitely seeing that. And I expect that to continue here for a little while.  I think that the -- let me -- the puts and the takes, right? So I think the negatives are general industrial slowing, and I think we're going to face those headwinds here, at least through the second quarter of next year. It's hard to imagine that, that's not the case. And then you've got the question of whether ag, semi are bottoming. If you look at kind of the auto side, you're probably bottoming in China auto, and then you probably -- if you look at the expectations of auto builds, those are down for next year, so maybe a little more pressure there. But I do think that net-net, those are still going to struggle for a little while until we see some uptick in semi, which, by the way, we have seen some things that look like a bottom in semi. Ag, I think, is still a question mark here with the trade tensions. And then municipal and health of science, those are going to hold in. Deane Dray : Yes. That's exactly what we'd expect. And look, you cannot control the slowing on the end markets, but you're obviously doing a great job on margins and cash flow, so congrats on that. Andrew Silvernail : Well, thanks, Deane. I think the important thing there is controlling our own destiny. We've talked to all of you guys about the playbook. We've looked at it in a slowing environment. We're certainly working that. We know how to deal in those environments and make sure that we deliver for our customers, our people and certainly our shareholders. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Nathan Jones : Come on, Andy, control the end markets. Question on working capital. I mean it looks like you guys managed inventory really well in the quarter in the face of probably some slower revenue that you were anticipating. Maybe you can talk about whether you need to reduce your inventory levels here in the face of this lower demand environment, whether you can generate some cash over and above what your excellent free cash flow conversion normally is here in this environment? Andrew Silvernail : Yes. I think, Nathan, so first of all, this is something from a business model standpoint we've talked about a lot that even in times where you're getting pressure on the top line of the business and pressure on margins that the balance sheet delevers really nicely. And so from a cash EPS perspective, that will hold up well. I expect we'll see more delevering in the fourth quarter. And then we'll kind of see where we are in terms of what we're planning for next year. But certainly, in the fourth quarter, I expect more delevering. Nathan Jones : So you're not in any kind of heavy downturn here. You're talking about flat 4Q, kind of plus 2% to minus to 2% 2020 outlook. Are there any meaningful cost action plans that you take here? Are there particular businesses where you're seeing worse demand where you think you need to take some cost actions, and maybe what those would be? Andrew Silvernail : Yes, you absolutely do. And to be clear, in this kind of environment and really for IDEX in total, these kinds of things are never broad-based, right? We're never -- we are not a company that does these kind of wacky 5% reductions across the board. The key to any kind of -- facing an environment like this is, number one, you want to invest in the things that drive long-term, sustainable competitive advantage and value. And for us, that really comes down to two big things. The first : our people. And we view people as being central to the business model. It's what scales in this company. And so we're going to continue to invest in the leadership development around the company and making sure that we're very focused on that. Second, it's really kind of innovation in our core markets. If you think about the 80-20 and the segmentation work that we do around where are the profit pools? How do you continue to make those growth bets going forward? And then what you do is you look kind of around that outside of those core strategic areas and you just have to be prudent, right? There are places that we're already making targeted cost reductions. We're going to have to do some more of that if we see some weakening there. And that's just the right thing to do for the long-term competitiveness of the company. And so we're executing that playbook. We're looking out into the future. As I said, my expectation in this current environment is what you really have in 2020 is a pretty tough comp in Q1, Q2 and then an easier comp in the back half, weighing out to that kind of plus 2% to minus 2%. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville from D.A. Davidson. Matt Summerville : A couple of questions. First, can you maybe give a little bit more geographic granularity in terms of incoming orders and organic performance in the quarter? Andrew Silvernail : Yes, Matt. Bill, you want to tackle it? William Grogan : Yes, sure. No, I think it was -- Europe is going to maintain its lower level that we've seen over the last couple of quarters. It was really more declines in North America that we started to see that broader orders -- order number down. We actually did outperform a bit in some of the emerging markets, but again, relative to the fundamental macro situations within -- in India and in China, our teams really delivered on their targeted growth initiatives and grew in the upper single digits in those areas. Andrew Silvernail : Yes. So the incremental softening, Matt, has really been around North America. William Grogan : Exactly. Matt Summerville : Got it. And then just back maybe to FMT margins, up $270 million sequentially. Up, I think -- or $270 million year-over-year, up $170 million sequentially. On a sequential basis, that's on lower revenue. So can you talk about are you pushing more price through that business? Are your input costs coming down meaningfully? Maybe just kind of parse out how you're getting that margin and what the right way to think about FMT margins are kind of going forward at what you're calling kind of a more subdued general industrial environment for that business? William Grogan : Yes. I would say 30% is probably closer to what its normal run rate is. Those businesses, even on lower volume, are running lights out with the remaining projects that they had. And then the input costs have decreased. I think the teams, as they looked at where they're getting some pressure from tariffs, they've been able to come up with some supply chain solutions to reduce the impact of those. And the pricing that we put out last year in Q3 to offset some of those just levered better within the quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Vertical Research Partners. Brett Linzey : Just wanted to come back to price cost. It sounds like you got a very good price traction in the quarter. You do start to lap a tough like-unlike price in Q4 next year. But given the moderating commodities, does price start to flatten out as we get into 2020? Or do you still think you can achieve positive price in some of those businesses? Andrew Silvernail : Brett, we'll get positive price in 2020, I feel very confident in that. The nature of the business model, the nature of our competitive positioning, it'll be lighter than certainly in 2019, there's no doubt about it, but I don't see any reason why we won't sustain that kind of 30 to 40 bp price cost leverage that we've gotten in the past.  Bill, anything else you'd add to that? William Grogan : Yes. I think the spread as we come into the back half was -- is higher than that. But next year, as we calibrate around our 2020 pricing actions, it'll come down a bit. But to Andy's point, I think we'll still be significantly positive on the price cost differential. Brett Linzey : Okay. Great. And then just shifting to the funding delays in rescue. It sounds like that gets resolved in Q4. What informs that, I guess? And then have you seen any type of funding delays broaden to other agencies as we enter this election cycle? Andrew Silvernail : Yes. So with rescue in particular, there are kind of two things that you saw. One is just around the world, we've seen this in the past, it's happened many, many times, you get -- the sovereign governments who are buying product from us, as things get tight, they can pull back. And so we're seeing that relieve. Why? Because we're very close to our customers, and we know when money is going to be relieved just generally. So we feel pretty good about that. And then you've got the FEMA issue that Bill referenced. For some reason, and we don't quite understand why, FEMA money got tied up here in the third quarter, and it feels like it's been released already. There's no reason to believe that's not going to happen or hasn't happened already. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg Capital Markets. Andrew Buscaglia : Can you make -- can you comment more, you said that you think semis was showing signs of bottoming, and that's -- can you just remind us, first off, what -- how big is that as a percentage of your sales at this point? And then what -- why do you say that? Or what are you seeing specifically? Andrew Silvernail : Yes. So it's not a big chunk in total. William Grogan : About 3%. Andrew Silvernail : It's about 3% in total for the business. The biggest impact there is in our Sealing business, and then we have a small pump business that faces that also. And when I say bottoming or inflecting, there's no reason to believe that this thing is picking up dramatically, but we've gotten significant signals from a handful of the big players that they're projecting stronger demand. Now that is mixed with a couple of other things that they see some softening in there. But we're converting a lot of customers over time. And so it's -- a lot of that has been a share game on top of what's happening to the market. So in other words, Andrew, we're getting direct signals from people on higher demand to get our supply chains ready. But to be clear, I would not use us as a bellwether for the semiconductor market. We are not the right people to talk to about that. Andrew Buscaglia : Got it. Okay. And then I know people are kind of taking up this question a bit, but it's -- you hurt your sales only about 2% -- or you'll do about 2% this year. And you really -- you drove a really impressive incremental margin off of that. That's on the heels of strong incrementals in the prior year. So the question is how long can you keep this up at -- if you're only -- it sounds like, correct me if I'm wrong, you're implying about 2% plus or minus in 2020 for the top line. So it just seems unrealistic that expansion is likely. Andrew Silvernail : Yes. I think -- so there are a couple of things that really matter there. The first one is the overall top line, when you -- when we are -- I want to call it 2% is kind of the tipping point, right? And 2%, you're covering your inflation, you can still get incremental margins. You get north of 2%, 3%, 4%, you start to really drive those incremental margins in that 30% to 35% range. But 2% is about where you hit parity with just offsetting normal inflation that happens in the business. So overall, kind of that volume number matters. Second, that price cost -- what you get between price and cost, if we can keep that 30% to 40%, that will play into that first part and certainly adds to any kind of expansion that you drive for here going out. So look, if we're sub 2% growth rates, it's going to be harder to get any kind of expansion, and we work to really hold the line is what we work to do. And if you get north of 2%, we'll absolutely get expansion just with the normal contribution and the price leverage that we get. Andrew Buscaglia : Okay. And I guess, the flip side is you're -- you sound like it's unlikely margins will degrade much, if anything. Andrew Silvernail : So let's take the other scenario. So let's say we're down next year. And we've talked about kind of how we thought about that, and I'm going to bore you guys for a second, but our overall playbook is looking at what I call a vanilla recession, looks at kind of 5% down. That's $125 million of top line coming down, that would be about $75 million unabated that would hit the bottom line. Our goal would be to offset that by about $25 million of cost reductions, and so you can do the math on how that works out. We're -- in that kind of environment, we're going to be super thoughtful. I mean could you go further? Could you go deeper? Have we done that in the past? We have, but we won't do that. And as I've said to you all in the past, if that scenario plays out that I'm talking about, we are going to make sure that we keep reinvesting aggressively in the business. And so that $25 million range is about what you can do and not have to make other very, very hard trade-offs. And so we would make sure that we're super thoughtful. Again, we're investing in those critical priorities around our people and the really attractive businesses we have in terms of innovating in those profit pools. But that's how we're thinking about it generally. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen. Joseph Giordano : Apologies in advance, you might have covered this. I got disconnected for a little bit in the beginning of the Q&A here. But when I look at your CapEx, generally, it scales up in the second half of the year. Clearly, you have some markets moving other ways and you're being cautious, but how should we think about that level for the rest of the year and into next year? Andrew Silvernail : Yes. So we're going to be at about $55 million, which is about $5 million less, and that was not our intention. It's a matter of timing and the ability to actually get some stuff in within the fourth quarter. So that $55 million, $60 million range, that's a healthy range with our business right now, and I would expect that to be similar going into next year, plus or minus. Joseph Giordano : Okay. And then is your fourth quarter in HST -- I know some of it seems timing related with the order decline there, but is that like a direct impact into the revenue number that you anticipate for Q4 there? Andrew Silvernail : I don't think it's a big impact. It's just that timing of that order, those things are blankets that are going to be in the future. So I'm not -- I don't think that's a real impact to the fourth quarter. William Grogan : Yes. I mean, OEMs, when they place it, we've had some volatility between Q3, Q4 and Q1 that have created some noise in the comps there. Joseph Giordano : Okay. And then if I could just clarify something, Andy, I think you -- in your downside analysis that you just ran through on a 5% decline, did you say $75 million would come off, like, unabated to the bottom line on $125 million decline. Did I just hear that? Andrew Silvernail : Yes. I'm just using the -- if you do nothing, right, and effectively, it flows through at what we call material margin, right, so material contribution or value added, that's what it would be if we did nothing, right? So that's 50% of the contribution margins of the company. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. There are no other questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks. Andrew Silvernail : Well, thank you very much, Doug. I appreciate it. And thank you all for your time and attention here on our call. Again, in this kind of volatile environment that we've all been living in, I could not be more proud of the team in terms of how they have executed and delivered for -- really, for our customers first and then for our people and also for you, our shareholders. So we're thrilled about that. We appreciate the support that we get from the investment community. And with that, we will say goodbye and talk to you here again in 90 days. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings, and welcome to IDEX Corporation\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to your host, Mike Yates. Thank you. You may begin. Mike Yates : Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. This is Mike Yates, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for IDEX Corporation. Let me start by saying thank you for joining us for a discussion of the IDEX fourth quarter and full year 2019 financial highlights. Last night, we issued a press release outlining our company\u2019s financial and operating performance for the three months and the year ending December 31, 2019. The press release, along with presentation slides to be used during today\u2019s webcast, can be accessed on our company\u2019s website at www.idexcorp.com. Joining me today is Andy Silvernail, our Chairman and CEO; and Bill Grogan, our Chief Financial Officer. The format for our call is as follows; we will begin with Andy providing an overview of our operating performance in the quarter and for the full year. Bill then will walk you through the fourth quarter and full year 2019 financial results and the operating performance within each of our segments. And finally, Andy will wrap up with an outlook for the first quarter and the full year 2020. Following our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open the call for your questions. If you should need to exit the call for any reason, you may access a complete replay beginning approximately 2 hours after the call concludes by dialing the toll-free number 877-660-6853 and entering conference ID 13694803, or you may simply log on to our company\u2019s homepage for our webcast replay. Before we begin, a brief reminder that this call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbor language in last night\u2019s press release and in IDEX\u2019 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Andy Silvernail. Andy Silvernail : Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate you joining us to discuss our 2019 fourth quarter and full year operating results. 2019 was another record year for IDEX. We hit all-time highs on most of our key metrics. We continue to grow organically through our target growth initiatives and our ability to capture value through strategic pricing. We expanded margins by leveraging our top line, and we executed well on our productivity funnel. Our efforts resulted in records in sales, margin, earnings, free cash flow and return on invested capital. We built IDEX to outperform over a cycle and we\u2019re doing the things to make IDEX different. We\u2019re investing in great teams who focus on the critical few priorities within our outstanding businesses, all of which is in service to our customers. This is what separates IDEX from our competition and allows us to deliver for our customers, employees and shareholders. We\u2019ve been candid in our view of the weakened global economy. This continued in Q4 and we believe it will for the next quarter or two. While the Phase 1 trade deal was signed, customers up and down the supply chain remain hesitant to spend in the face of uncertainty. Additionally, in 2020, we lapped three very successful multiyear growth initiatives worth $30 million that aren\u2019t repeating. Our funnel growth initiatives are strong, but will face additional headwinds especially in the first half. Understanding the challenging environment, we proactively executed on the playbook we\u2019ve previously discussed with you. We want to ensure that we\u2019re well positioned to perform and invest for long-term profitable growth. To that end, we executed restructuring in the fourth quarter that will result in $15 million of savings in 2020. The current environment is challenging, but we\u2019ll control our own destiny through focus and execution. I\u2019m confident in our capabilities. The strength of our diversified portfolio and the quality of our teams are fully demonstrated in these times. Our proactive cost reductions along with a strong balance sheet put us in a great position to continue to deliver long-term value for our shareholders during volatile times. We have the team, the strategy and the capital available to perform and to take advantage of opportunities as they present themselves. One such opportunity is the Flow MD acquisition we announced last night. Flow Management Devices is a leading provider of small volume provers used to ensure flow accuracy in the critical applications in the oil and gas industry. FMD has annual sales of approximately $60 million and EBITDA margins of about 20%. We think their innovative technology will provide above-market growth, and this will complement our ability to execute on operational efficiencies. We believe there are at least 500 basis points of margin expansion, and we\u2019re excited to have them as part of the IDEX family. The rest of our M&A pipeline is solid, and we continue to actively assess several opportunities. With nearly $2 billion of capital available, we\u2019ll aggressively pursue the right opportunities while remaining disciplined within our return framework. As for the other tenets of capital deployment, while CapEx was down slightly compared to last year, much of the decline was due to timing of a few projects moving into 2020. We continue to invest aggressively in opportunities to stimulate organic growth and drive margin expansion. We will also continue to focus on returning value to our shareholders. In 2019, we returned $147 million to shareholders via dividends, a 16% increase over last year, and we bought back $55 million of stock at an average price of $140.52. We remain focused on our capital deployment strategy as a significant source of value creation. I\u2019m going to pause here. I\u2019m going to turn it over to Bill, who\u2019s going to talk about the financial results and the segment discussion. Bill Grogan : Thanks, Andy. I\u2019ll start with our consolidated financial results on Slide 4. Q4 orders of $617 million were up 1% overall and flat organically. I\u2019ll get into more detail through the segment discussions. However, at a high level, the slowdown in our industrial end markets negatively impacted a significant portion of our portfolio. This was offset by positive momentum in our life sciences, fire and rescue and pharma businesses. For the year, orders were flat, both overall and organically with strong organic orders in the first half of the year, offset by the slowdown we experienced in the back half. Q4 sales of $606 million were down 1% overall and down 2% organically. Industrial market softness and the runoff in targeted growth initiatives negatively impacted us in the fourth quarter. Full year sales of $2.5 billion were flat overall and up 1% organically, driven by price and strong target growth performance in several businesses, offset by short-cycle industrial volume declines and the softness we saw in semi, auto and ag throughout the year. Q4 gross margins contracted 60 basis points to 44% in the quarter, driven by a decline in volume and unfavorable sales mix. For the year, full gross margins expanded 10 basis points. However, excluding the impact of the third quarter, Velcora inventory step-up, adjusted gross margins expanded 20 basis points to 45.2%, driven by price and productivity more than offsetting the volume and mix pressure and our continued investments in engineering. Q4 operating margin was 22.1% and full year margin was 23.2%. Adjusting for restructuring expenses and the fair value step-up in Q3, adjusted operating margin was 23.3% in the fourth quarter and 24.2% for the year. The 23.3% Q4 margin was flat to 2018 and the full year 24.2% increased 80 basis points compared with the adjusted prior year, mainly driven by our gross margin expansion and lower SG&A costs from decreased variable compensation expenses and overall tighter cost controls. Our Q4 effective tax rate was 20.6%, which was lower than the 23.8% in the prior year period due to certain onetime charges related to tax reform incurred in the fourth quarter of 2018 and several small discrete tax benefits in 2019. For the year, our effective tax rate also benefited from discrete items we realized in 2019 associated with equity vesting and option exercising. In Q4 adjusted net income was $102 million, resulting in an adjusted EPS of $1.33, up $0.02 or 2% over prior year adjusted EPS. Full year adjusted net income was $444 million, resulting in an adjusted EPS of $5.80, up $0.39 or 7% compared to prior year. Finally, free cash flow was $137 million, flat compared to prior year, but was 134% of adjusted net income. For the year, free cash flow was $477 million, a record for IDEX, up 13% versus last year and was 100% \u2013 107% of adjusted net income. I\u2019ll now turn to the segment discussion, I\u2019m on Slide 5, starting with Fluid & Metering. Q4 orders were down 5% overall and down 4% organically, mainly driven by softening demand in the industrial market and continued declines in agriculture. Full year orders were flat overall, but up 2% organically due to chemical market strength and targeted growth wins more than offsetting weaker industrial and ag performance. Q4 sales were down 4% overall and down 3% organically, driven by the industrial market softness and runoff of targeted growth initiatives. Full year sales were up 1% overall and 2% organically due to the strong targeted growth performance in the first three quarters of the year along with strong chemical market and stable municipal and energy markets, again, more than offsetting the industrial and ag softness we experienced. In regards to our agricultural market, the market dynamics remain unchanged due to continued tariff pressures and depressed commodity prices, which put pressure on our Banjo business. While there is cautious optimism from the Phase 1 trade deal, we are not forecasting any near-term change to the U.S. ag market. OEM forecasts have improved, but are still negative. As it relates to the industrial space, in December, we saw U.S. industrial production post the lowest results in a decade. The contraction in the European markets we have seen over the last few quarters continued, and we see this pressure in both North America and Europe carrying into 2020. Finally, adjusted operating margin. For the quarter, it was 28%, down 110 basis points compared to the prior year, driven by volume declines in sales mix along with start-up costs associated with the new plant opening within our energy platform. Full year adjusted operating margin was 30.1%, an increase of 90 basis points year-over-year, mainly driven by price capture and delivering on productivity initiatives across the segment. Let\u2019s move on to Health & Science, turning to Slide 6. Q4 orders were up 6% overall and 3% organically, driven by our life science OEMs and strength in MPT. Full year orders were flat overall and down 1% organically due to soft semiconductor, auto and industrial markets, offset by positive performance in life sciences and pharma markets. From a sales perspective, Q4 sales were up 1% overall and down 3% organically. Full year sales were up 2% overall and 1% organically, driven by strength in our life sciences business for the quarter and full year as they continue to experience growth tied to new product development and collaboration with key customers. On a comparable basis, life sciences grew 6% for the year. At Gast, we continue to see challenging market conditions in the fourth quarter due to weakened North American and European industrial distribution coupled with the runoff of targeted growth initiatives that began in 2018 and ended in Q3 of this year. For the full year, Gast was up organically due to strong performance with that initiative. For MPT, strong order performance continued in Q4 as we continued momentum within our key pharma markets. MPT\u2019s backlog puts them in a great position for the first half of 2020. Finally, within Sealing, we saw pressure in the industrial and oil and gas markets, but some growth in semicon late in the quarter and are cautiously optimistic for that to continue into 2020. From a margin perspective, excluding restructuring expenses, fourth quarter adjusted operating margin decreased 60 basis points to 22.8%. This was primarily due to the volume decline and engineering investments in the business. Full year adjusted operating margin increased 20 basis points to 23.8% due to price and cost control efforts. I\u2019m now moving to our final segment, Diversified. I\u2019m on Slide 7. Q4 orders were up 1% overall and 2% organically. Full year orders were down 2% overall and flat organically, mostly due to the project nature of dispensing. Q4 sales were flat, but up 1% organically. Full year sales were down 2% and flat organically as well, primarily driven by an 11% decrease at dispensing. The balance of the segment was up low single digits for the year. Adjusted operating margin of 26.2% decreased 30 basis points in the quarter. For the full year, adjusted operating margin of 26.6% was down 20 basis points, primarily due to sales mix with dispensing. FSD\u2019s performance was mainly driven by, on the fire side, North American OEM and municipal markets continue to perform well. We\u2019re experiencing steady growth across our offerings as well as continued momentum around the new SAM product. In rescue, we saw a bounce back in Q4 with the release of FEMA spending we discussed last quarter as well as high demand for the new watertight tool they launched earlier in the year. BAND-IT\u2019s performance moderated in the quarter with relative strength in transportation being offset by softness in the industrial and oil and gas markets. Finally, dispensing story continued with tough comps against project wins in 2018 and a lack of new projects occurring this year. For 2020, we do not see a recovery now and expect dispensing to be flat for the year. I\u2019ll now pass it back to Andy to provide an update on our 2020 guidance. Andy Silvernail : Thanks, Bill. Hey, everybody, I\u2019m on Slide 8. So on an operational basis, as we look at the year, I expect market headwinds to persist in the first half. And overall for the year, we expect organic revenue to be flat to down 2%. We expect this to translate to EPS being up $0.09 to possibly being down $0.30 depending upon the top line results. We have price capture about 80 basis points baked into the guide. We expect our productivity initiatives to more than offset inflation, providing $0.02 of benefit. And as I mentioned earlier, our focus continues to be to invest in organic opportunities. These growth investments will be about a $0.04 headwind in 2020. As I mentioned, the cost actions that we took in the fourth quarter, this will result in $0.15 of benefit. Additionally, we can get up to $0.20 if market conditions worsen. We anticipate a $0.06 to $0.10 headwind from variable compensation as we reset our incentive comp for 2020. We expect our Velcora acquisition will provide $0.01 \u2013 excuse me, 1% of growth on the top line and $0.03 of benefits to EPS. As we look at some of the nonoperational items, FX and share count should offset. And we expect a $0.10 headwind from tax, primarily related to discrete benefits we got from \u2013 associated with the equity vesting and options exercising. So in summary, we\u2019re projecting revenue to be flat to down 2% in 2020 and EPS to be in the range of $5.55 to $5.85. So let me wrap things up. I\u2019ll provide some additional details regarding our 2020 guidance for both the first quarter and the full year. I\u2019m on the last slide. That\u2019s Slide 9. In Q1, we expect EPS to be in the range of $1.30 to $1.34 with market headwinds contributing 4% to 5% organic revenue decline and operating margins of about 23%. We don\u2019t expect any significant impact from FX. We expect the corporate tax rate to be about 20% and Q1 corporate costs to be about $20 million. If you look at the full year 2020, again, we expect EPS to be $5.55 to $5.85. Full year revenue is projected to be flat to down 2% and OP margin should be somewhere between 23.8% and 24.5%. We don\u2019t expect FX to have a significant impact. And for the year, we expect tax to be at about 22%. CapEx is anticipated to be about $55 million and free cash flow should be around 105% to 110% of net income. And finally, corporate costs should be around $75 million for the year. As always, our earnings guidance excludes any costs associated with future acquisitions or future restructuring. With that, Rob, let me turn it over to you and we\u2019ll take questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mike Halloran with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Mike Halloran : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Andy Silvernail : Good morning, Mike. How are you? Mike Halloran : I\u2019m all good. I\u2019m all good. So could you help understand the dynamic as you\u2019re seeing it today. When you look at the back half of the year orders, down 5% or so in the third, flattish in the fourth. The first quarter guide implies something worse than that trajectory maybe implies. Now maybe comps are part of the variability there. But talk about what you\u2019re seeing in the short term that kind of leads to that decline, if you\u2019re still seeing some deceleration in the market and customers psyche as you see it today? Andy Silvernail : Yes, Mike. So from where we are right now, we don\u2019t see the industrial markets, in particular, getting worse. There\u2019s no indication that it\u2019s getting worse. You\u2019ve got a couple \u2013 and I think \u2013 and that\u2019s \u2013 I think that\u2019s probably the most important thing. As you saw the deceleration in the fourth quarter particularly towards the end of the year of the industrials, that was the biggest negative for us in the fourth quarter and actually really in the back half of all of last year. We\u2019ve been doing our annual planning. We finished up, what we call, our true-up just recently. And from what we can see, we\u2019re not seeing a further deceleration in industrials. So the question, how does that turn into a negative 4%, negative 5%? And there are really a few pieces to that. The first is, you\u2019re right, it\u2019s a tough comp. We had a pretty strong first quarter of last year. Second, the overall order rate in the fourth quarter is a little bit masked by the fact that we had real strength in HST. And so that \u2013 if you remember, in the third quarter, we said that we felt like there was a blanket that usually land somewhere between the third, fourth or the first quarter. It came in the fourth quarter. So if you kind of \u2013 if you separate out from that, orders are a little bit weaker overall. And of course, that sale is going to happen kind of later in this year, possibly even bleeding over to the first quarter of next year. So you got comps, you\u2019ve got that and you\u2019ve got just the general industrial softness that we see generally bottling right now. Mike Halloran : Makes sense. And then when you think about the guidance for the full year, what sort of environment is embedded in them. In other words, is there an improvement assumed in the underlying fundamentals? Or is it relative stability sequentially? And then secondarily and related, what are you guys looking for to get a little bit more confidence that your customer base is going to be willing to put more CapEx dollars to work. I\u2019m assuming we look at a lot of the same quantitative things, but anything qualitative on that side would be helpful. Andy Silvernail : Yes, Mike. So I think if you take our top line guide of 0% to down 2%. And if you remember, when we were at the Baird conference, we bracketed it around plus 2% to negative 2%, right? So that\u2019s kind of been our view for a while. So we\u2019re now at kind of 0% to negative 2%. So let me talk about what I think would have to happen to land at one end or the other. So to land at 0%, you\u2019d have to have a modest improvement \u2013 I mean, very modest improvement in the second half of the year. So we\u2019re expecting the first half to be weak with all the stuff I just talked about and a very modest improvement. Part of that is we\u2019re going to have that larger life science sales happening in the back half of the year, which is a positive. And then a very, very modest improvement coming up against much easier comps in the second half. So there\u2019s no hockey stick. There\u2019s no aggressive improvement assumed. It\u2019s pretty dang modest to get to the 0%. The negative 2% assumes that what we were experiencing in the fourth quarter continues the entire year. So if you kind of look \u2013 if you flat line from here, that\u2019s the negative 2%. Mike Halloran : Appreciate it. Thank you, Andy. Andy Silvernail : Yes. No problem, Mike. Operator : Our next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Allison Poliniak : Hi, guys. Good morning. Andy Silvernail : Hi, Allison. Allison Poliniak : Just want to go back to your comment about the targeted growth initiatives rolling off. And it doesn\u2019t sound like there\u2019s stuff behind it, but I assume there is. Just \u2013 is it just the market? Andy Silvernail : Yes. Allison Poliniak : Can you just walk us through that a little bit? Andy Silvernail : Yes. So if you look back to kind of 2018 or so and when we were blowing the doors off of growth. And we said, hey, we can get \u2013 we can talk discretely about where that\u2019s coming from. That\u2019s what we call targeted growth. So \u2013 and what was happening was we were winning above where we thought we would win plus things being sticking and kind of building into the run rate. And so what we\u2019re seeing right now is we have three of those initiatives. Two of that are in HST and one in FMT that are \u2013 frankly, as the market is softening, we\u2019re not seeing that happen again. And one of them is very much discrete relative to going into a more consumer-facing business. So that\u2019s kind of the $30 million headwind. To your point, we have \u2013 in any year, we\u2019re tracking about 25 discrete growth initiatives at the corporate level that are worth anywhere from, call it, $50 million to $100 million. That\u2019s the kind of the range that you\u2019re looking at. And for us to hit our stated goal of trying to be 2% above our core markets, you got to win about half of those. And so I\u2019m not worried about what we\u2019re winning this year. I actually feel very good about what we\u2019re winning. We just have a bigger hole than we historically have had, and that\u2019s at $30 million. Bill Grogan : I think the thing to add to is some of those projects are just taking a little bit longer to materialize with the end market. So as the end products are going to be launched by customers, those have just been delayed a little bit. Andy Silvernail : Yes. That\u2019s a good point, Bill. You do see kind of uptake or market acceptance be slower and softer in market conditions like this. Allison Poliniak : Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then just turning to the acquisition. It seems like a good fit for IDEX. What does it bring to the table that maybe you didn\u2019t have or you couldn\u2019t do yourself? Andy Silvernail : Yes. So we definitely could not have done this ourselves. It\u2019s \u2013 so if you think of custody transfer, we\u2019re in the custody transfer business already, but it\u2019s in a different market segment in oil and gas. And this is kind of a perfect IDEX product where we\u2019re going into the custody transfer market with a very distinctive niche technology that some of the bigger players and larger applications don\u2019t have in the market and would be tough to develop, and it has some intellectual property associated with it. So it\u2019s in adjacency to our custody transfer business. It\u2019s in adjacency to our LACT business. And it kind of gives us a classic IDEX-like wonderful innovative technology that\u2019s in a faster-growing overall segment than the marketplace and terrific positioning with good competitive moats. Allison Poliniak : Perfect. Thank you. Andy Silvernail : Thank, Allison. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Graham with Rosenblatt Securities. Please proceed with your question. Scott Graham : Hey. Good morning. Andy Silvernail : Hey, Scott. Scott Graham : So just \u2013 first one is a sort of a 40,000-foot question. If I look at the \u2013 on a full year basis, your organic was up a point. And I know your pricing was probably landed in the 1% to 2% territory, suggesting that on a full year basis, volumes were flat, maybe even slightly down. And I just \u2013 we could certainly triangulate where that came from? What\u2019s the plan there? I know it\u2019s not the goal even when you talk about the fixed businesses to have a potential negative volume. What are you thinking there, Andy? Andy Silvernail : Yes. So it really \u2013 it\u2019s the entire \u2013 it\u2019s the marketplace, right? So if you look at industrial production, if you \u2013 and we \u2013 obviously, we track pretty closely to industrial production in terms of our markets. If you were to track IDEX\u2019 organic growth relative to industrial production over a long period of time, what you\u2019d see is you\u2019d see when industrial production inflects one way or the other, up or down, we tend to be slightly exaggerated in both cases, right? So when industrial production inflects down, we tend to be a little bit worse than that. Our markets tend to be a little bit worse than that. And when it inflects up, we tend to be better than that. When it\u2019s relatively stable, our markets track to it pretty closely. So if you\u2019re going to think of it as a graph, that\u2019s what that would look like. And what we\u2019re experiencing right now, Scott, is that inflection downward, right? So if you look at the ISM, you look at industrial production overall, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been seeing here. And if you remember back this time last year, we were calling that. We said, look, that\u2019s what it looks like it\u2019s going to play out to us, and it is what\u2019s played out. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been preparing really for the balance of this year to execute a restructuring if we needed to. And so that\u2019s \u2013 when it gets me, really simplify it, that\u2019s what\u2019s going on in the world. I feel really good about how we\u2019re executing and what we\u2019re doing relative to those markets. I like our positioning. I like our ability to get price. Our overall moats around our business and competitive advantage are highly durable. So it\u2019s just a function of the markets. Bill Grogan : Scott, I think the other thing I\u2019d add is, obviously, dispensing had some significant pressure this year, being down almost $15 million that contributed to some of that volume decline, along with some of the very specific things we had within semicon and ag that put probably close to another $20 million of pressure on this year\u2019s volume. Scott Graham : Understood. Thank you. Those are great answers. I really appreciate that. The other question I had for you is on your bridge here, where \u2013 I think it\u2019s a tougher question to ask, of course, but could you explain a little bit more on the variable compensation, why that\u2019s negative for 2020, given the guidance? Maybe explain... Andy Silvernail : Yes. So \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s actually pretty straightforward. When you don\u2019t hit your goals, your comp comes down for the company. And then it basically kind of resets as you go into the year. So you\u2019ve got that headwind between the two. Scott Graham : Okay. Nothing more than that. No \u2013 there\u2019s not like something that\u2019s new as part of a comp plan or anything like that. Andy Silvernail : No. No. No. We\u2019re pretty steady around that stuff. Scott Graham : Okay. Great. And if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d love to sneak in one more here. Could you tell us what exactly pricing was in the quarter? And you\u2019ve always been able to do this or the last several years, at least, this 30, 40 basis point spread versus materials inflation. You expect to be able to maintain that next year, but also, of course, what was pricing this quarter? Andy Silvernail : Yes. So very consistent with the year, so just north of a point. And we did \u2013 for the year, we did a little bit better than that 30 to 40. We were \u2013 we had very strong productivity execution and inflation came in a little bit lower than we thought. It was actually pretty hot coming into last year. And so it was a little bit better than our normal 30 to 40. As you look at this year, we\u2019ve got \u2013 as I said in my remarks, we\u2019ve got about 80 basis points built into the guide right now with that same 30 to 40 spread. So we expect \u2013 as we look at the world right now, given the softness for us in the entire supply chain, we expect inflation to be pretty low. And overall, we actually expect to more than offset inflation with our normal productivity. Scott Graham : Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Andy Silvernail : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Our next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Nathan Jones : Good morning everyone. Andy Silvernail : Hey, Nathan. Nathan Jones : Just a follow-up to Allison\u2019s questions on the growth investments and the headwinds there. Talking about a $30 million headwind in 2020, can you talk a little bit more about that headwind? Are these \u2013 were these sales that are onetime in nature and go away, they don\u2019t build into the base and continue on that gets you to a $30 million headwind for this year? Andy Silvernail : So you actually got two different things that you\u2019re talking about, Nathan, so I\u2019m going to separate them and hopefully, I\u2019ll clarify. So the investments that are going into this year \u2013 we go into any year deciding on incremental investments. So you\u2019ve got an ongoing level of investment that happens in the company around growth. And then depending upon the opportunities in front of us, we decide whether or not we\u2019re going to put kind of incremental \u2013 above normal investments into some growth initiatives. And that\u2019s what that headwind is that we talked about \u2013 that $0.04 headwind that we talked about. And the way to think about this is none of this is \u2013 none of the investment that we\u2019re going to make in 2020 is going to do anything for us in 2020, right? It\u2019s going to \u2013 it\u2019s for future growth. And that\u2019s just the nature of our markets. So that\u2019s kind of the one side of it, which is we\u2019re going to continue investing in our growth opportunities to help us outgrow our competitive marketplaces. And that\u2019s what that incremental investment is. The $30 million that you\u2019re referring to, those are really things that have been in play for a very long time, right? So the benefits that we\u2019ve gotten over the years, you\u2019re talking about stuff that\u2019s been in play five, six, seven years in many cases. And what\u2019s happening is they are coming to a natural end more abruptly than we would normally see in our marketplace. Some of it has to do \u2013 some of it is, for instance, in the LACT business, where the sensitivity to what\u2019s going on in oil and gas, overall spending is down. So the uptake is there. But to be clear, that\u2019s still \u2013 that\u2019s gone from zero to a $30 million business for us in the last, what, three years, Bill? So it\u2019s still a very nice business. It\u2019s just going to be down versus last year. Another is on the Gast side, where we really took wonderful advantage of a market opportunity where we had developed a unique technology, where they built out a huge number of venues very, very quickly. And so we\u2019ll still get parts and service revenue from that, but that kind of two-year really aggressive build-out won\u2019t replicate itself. We\u2019ll do it in other places in the market, but it\u2019s going to be \u2013 it\u2019s just not going to be the same size that it was in 2019, 2018. So it\u2019s pretty unique for us to kind of have all those tailwinds all at the same time, and we\u2019re kind of facing a little bit of that in 2020 as we go forward. But if you just kind of step back from all of this and you say, is our strategy of investing for above-market growth working? The way I think of it is \u2013 if you think about the last three years in total, so 2017, 2018, 2019, we\u2019ve had organic growth that\u2019s averaged about 5% when you look at all those. With industrial production, I want to say around 2.4% or so. And so we\u2019re basically double industrial production. We\u2019re beating that 200 basis points that we\u2019ve set as a target. It\u2019s not going to happen every single year. But over a three-year period, boy, it should happen and it has happened. Nathan Jones : Okay. That makes sense. And my follow-up question is on the restructuring that you did in the fourth quarter, taking out $15 million of cost for a midpoint of down 1% organically. That\u2019s a bit more aggressive than I would have expected from you guys. I know you\u2019ve always said it\u2019s easy to ramp the business up than to run it down. So is this kind of \u2013 you\u2019ve taken cost out. If things are a bit worse than you anticipate in 2020, you\u2019ve already kind of addressed that cost there. Andy Silvernail : You\u2019ve got it exactly right, Nathan. When \u2013 these things are painful. They\u2019re traumatic to businesses. And we don\u2019t like to be in the business of pressing this button. And so if you have to press it, you press it once. And our intention \u2013 we\u2019ve got about another $5 million of more variable stuff that\u2019s not people related that we can address if things get softer from here. That\u2019s why it goes up to $20 million in the down 2% scenario. But a big piece of who we are as a company, a big piece of our culture is that we don\u2019t engage in these never-ending restructurings that cause uncertainty. A big piece of our value proposition to the marketplace for people is that this is a company that grows, this is a company that invests in people and our culture is a huge piece of who we are in terms of our identity. And so we do this with real trepidation and you do it one time, if you can. Nathan Jones : Okay. That makes sense. Thanks very much for the time. I\u2019ll pass it on. Andy Silvernail : Thanks, Nathan. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question. Matt Summerville : Thanks. Just a question on HST, first. Can you maybe talk about what kind of organic growth rates you think you\u2019ll experience in life science and the pharma business in 2019, or excuse me, in 2020. And then conversely how much contraction you\u2019ve built into that industrial side of the business? Andy Silvernail : Yes. So, I think generally you\u2019re looking at 5% to 6% Matt. If you look at the combination of what we would call IDEX Health & Science LLC, which is Life Science and MPT which is principally going into food \u2013 pharma and food. So I think with those two combined, you\u2019re looking at, call it 5%-ish, maybe a little bit better if you can get to 6% which I\u2019d have to back into the math. Bill, do you know what the math is, say we\u2019re down for the other stuff. If we went down 3%. Is that what that we count you? Will Grogan : Yes, about. Andy Silvernail : Yes, about, I want to say down about 3% Matt, that\u2019s more kind of industrial facing. Analyst Matt Summerville : Got it. Thank you. And then you mentioned I think in your prepared remarks beyond Flow MD that you do indeed have other things in the pipeline. Can you sort of talk about relative size, magnitude of maybe actual actionability on those deals and maybe the end markets you\u2019re targeting? Andy Silvernail : Yes. So it\u2019s really, it\u2019s not a lot different. The funnel doesn\u2019t look a lot different than it\u2019s looked for quite a long time. It\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ve got a few things that are decent sized. I won\u2019t say big, but a decent size that we\u2019re working on, and it\u2019s hard to say actionability, right? Two, in particular that we\u2019re working on they are both auctions. As you know we have an incredibly disciplined methodology that we go about in terms of our ability to get to returns. And if we\u2019re able to make that happen then that would be exciting, at the same time the discipline of our return framework is important and we\u2019re not going to break that. Matt Summerville : Got it. Thank you, guys Andy Silvernail : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Andy Silvernail : Hey, Deane. Good morning. Deane Dray : Hey, Andy was hoping you could comment on where you see things playing out in China with the Coronavirus business disruptions. Are you baking anything in today\u2019s guidance for 2020 on today\u2019s guidance for 2020 on what\u2019s going on there? Andy Silvernail : So, Deane, as you know, it\u2019s a pretty fluid situation, there is a lot going on. What we\u2019ve done so far is we have paused travel to and from China, and then of course everything within China, we\u2019re following the guidelines of what\u2019s happening there in terms of people, people movement and just overall what\u2019s happening with the Lunar New Year. We\u2019re just \u2013 we\u2019re sticking to the policy that\u2019s out there. Because China isn\u2019t a big piece of our business, right it\u2019s \u2013 what\u2019s it now 6% Bill, 5%, 6%. I don\u2019t expect it to be material and we don\u2019t have a huge supply chain coming directly from China or into China. That being said, we will face what everybody else faces if this gets really, really significant and all of a sudden we see this grow and spread across the globe. But I don\u2019t expect it to be material in a differentiated way for us. Deane Dray : That\u2019s helpful. And I also appreciate the first thing you led with was you restricted travel, because it\u2019s your employee safety that matters most here. So I appreciate that. And then what more let\u2019s just say things do deteriorate further? And you\u2019re able to do restructuring, what are kind of the trigger points for you. Because we\u2019ve talked about the playbook here and discussed earlier. But what is it decrementals, where and how do you surgically make decisions if things were to worsen? Andy Silvernail : Yes. So if you remember what we\u2019ve talked about for quite some time is we\u2019ve looked at kind of a down 5% scenario, and I won\u2019t walk through all the math again. But if you recall, kind of how we work through that was essentially, if we were down 5%, we thought we could safely remove about $25 million from the company, half regarding people investment and half regarding variable investment. And so what I would say is that as we stand today, we\u2019ve addressed the half that is going to impact people. If this deteriorates further the next steps are not to take further actions where we have to restructure people out of the company. We\u2019ve essentially addressed that. The next $5 million that we have teed up, we talked about earlier, we know exactly where that is, we know exactly how to pull that. And I mean like down to the $0.01, we know exactly how to do that. So that\u2019s pretty clear. The following $5 million we have pretty good general buckets of how to do that and we\u2019ll monitor whether or not we have to get in there and get \u2013 and just pull that lever. We don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have to do that. So, let\u2019s imagine Deane that we go below the negative 2% scenario. If you go below the negative 2% scenario, there is about $5 million more in costs that we would go after. And then from there frankly we\u2019ve ride the decrementals. And they are \u2013 as one of the wonderful things about IDEX is we have incredible incremental margins, but it is painful on the downside. And so if we get kind of below 2% we will remove another $5 million. So we\u2019d have about $25 million of cost out. And then from there, we\u2019d probably ride that out to a down 5. If it\u2019s more than a down 5, we got a different scenario and we\u2019ll have to get more aggressive. I do not see a scenario where that happens. Deane Dray : Great. I really appreciate you segmenting out headcount versus fixed and that roadmap gives us good color as to how you proceed going forward. So, appreciate it. Thank you. Andy Silvernail : You bet, Deane. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Buscaglia : I just wanted to clarify something. You \u2013 so you kind of walked down a preliminary guide. I know it\u2019s very early on, but you were saying down 2% to up 2% at one point and then to get to flat to down 2%. But then you said early on in the Q&A that industrial is not really getting worse. So can you \u2013 it seems like the guide implies that things \u2013 you\u2019re a little more pessimistic here. Can you just kind of bifurcate that? Andy Silvernail : Yes. So let me just \u2013 I want to separate a little bit of what you say, make sure I understand it well. I think you\u2019ve got a question there that\u2019s about the tightening up of our range and... Andrew Buscaglia : Yes. To the low end. Andy Silvernail : Yes. And then about the impact on the full year. And then I think there is something in there you\u2019re asking about the first half, is that correct Andrew? Andrew Buscaglia : Yes. All right. And you made the comment on the industrial. You thought industrial \u2013 you don\u2019t think things will get worse from here. Andy Silvernail : Yes. So if \u2013 so, I think I answered when Mike asked the question earlier. If you look at that guide of zero to negative 2%. So back in the fall, we thought the range was plus 2% to negative 2% depending upon what happened with the industrials. The industrials weakened further, so that\u2019s what really brought us to the zero to negative 2%. That\u2019s the first part of it. When Mike was asking, kind of what would have to happen relative to the year, effectively if we stay exactly where we are today and things in the industrials continue to be as weak as they were at the end of the fourth quarter. And that\u2019s where I would see a negative 2% scenario. And that is \u2013 I don\u2019t believe that is the basis of where we should be. And so that\u2019s why it\u2019s a low-end of the range. If things get a little bit better in the industrials, in the second half of the year that\u2019s how you get to the zero. So that\u2019s that range it may or \u2013 so it really is what happens to the industrials for the balance of the year. My expectation is because the comps are pretty tough in the first and second quarter is that that\u2019s going to be a harder part of the year. So, first and second quarter, the first quarter being the hardest with very modest improvement in the second half of the year. Andrew Buscaglia : Got it. Okay. And then in Health & Science Technologies, you had good growth in the past couple of years. And then this year it kind of moderated, but it seems as though you\u2019re on the \u2013 from \u2013 EBITDA margins and margins in general are \u2013 well, on the EBITDA margin level, they flattened. The \u2013 what \u2013 I guess what is the long-term goal for margins here? What do you need to get those growing? And is M&A in this space something that you\u2019d be missing \u2013 the missing link to push those margins higher? Andy Silvernail : Yes. So in terms of growth, we would expect over the long term. And so I\u2019m going to say over a three to four or five year period, a good part of the cycle that HST is going to modestly outgrow the company as a whole. We kind of said over time, probably 1 point or so better in growth. And I believe that will still hold. I think that would be true over a given period of time. In any one quarter who knows, but in over any given period of time, I think that will be the case. In terms of margins, the story at HST is no different than the story with the rest of the company. Our margin expansion comes when we were growing organically, we have high variable margins and so we really get nice margin expansion, especially as we drive productivity. We have a little bit less pricing flexibility in HST than we do in FMT, but still we get positive price in total in that portfolio. So I\u2019d expect us to expand margins as we continue to grow the business. Acquisitions in HST, we\u2019ve made several, we\u2019ve built the entire ceiling platform in the last number of years and so we\u2019ll continue to do that. I don\u2019t see that as a margin enhancement. I don\u2019t see us buying things at 30% and 40% EBITDA margins. What I would expect is we\u2019ll buy things that have high structural barriers, good fundamentals and things that we can improve margins over time. So I\u2019d expect us to buy things that are kind of in the high teens to low 20s EBITDA margins and things that we can get into the mid to high 20s. Andrew Buscaglia : Okay. Thank you. Andy Silvernail : Thanks, Andrew. Operator : Our next question comes from Brett Linzey with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Brett Linzey : Hi. Good morning everyone. Andy Silvernail : Hey, Brett. Brett Linzey : Hey. Could you just provide some context around inventory in the distribution network, and specifically for FMT and I guess really how that stacks up against what you\u2019re seeing in POS and sell-through rates in January? Andy Silvernail : Yes. So, Brett, as you guys know, we don\u2019t have a lot of stocking inventory at distributors. So our distributors generally don\u2019t have a lot of our stuffs on their shelves waiting to be sold. So it\u2019s a little bit different model than some people who are selling to the classic big distributors. So we don\u2019t \u2013 we tend not to have that phenomenon of restocking destocking in a big way. It happens in small ways, but it tends not to happen in big ways. That being said, there are places that we track POS and it gives us some good information. What I would say, in those places is that inventories seem to be at about the right levels, and so I don\u2019t expect some significant destocking, I think, sell-through and sell-in are pretty close right now. That being said, I think generally distribution is pretty hesitant. I think there is an awful lot of hesitancy happening in distribution. They\u2019re watching their cash flows very, very carefully. So the best thing that we you can do in those things is drive lead times down, right. So we can drive lead times down, those folks who do have stocking distribution, it\u2019s a better overall cash flow scenario for them and that drives differentiation. So if you look at some of our businesses that do sell into distribution, there\u2019s an awful lot of focus on bringing down lead times as a piece of competitive advantage. Brett Linzey : Okay, great. And I just wanted to come back to restructuring, I was wondering, you gave a little color around the nature of the actions you\u2019re taking, but are these simply just shift reductions to help you navigate the near term. And then as we think about the back half or even next year and growth starts to inflect positive. Some of these costs come back? Or are these structural moves that you think you can just do more with less? Andy Silvernail : It\u2019s a little bit of both. And it\u2019s a balance between some corporate costs coming out and cost coming out at the business units. What I would expect is that as business comes back, there will be some costs that comes back for volume related. But I don\u2019t think all of it would come back kind of equivalent to revenue growth certainly in the short term, right. So one of the things that we\u2019ve said very consistently is, we\u2019re a business that can react very, very quickly on the upside. And so we tend to hold back a little bit so we don\u2019t find ourselves being over capacitized or having too much overhead structure. So I\u2019d expect it to come back a little bit, Brett. But we probably \u2013 if things improve, what you would expect from us are better than average incremental margins on the upside in the near term. Brett Linzey : Okay. Great. Thanks for the color. Andy Silvernail : Thanks, Brett. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. Francisco Amador : Good morning guys. This is Francisco on for Joe. Andy Silvernail : Hey, Francisco. Francisco Amador : So just wanted to get clarification on one of the remarks made on the Q4 highlights of FMT, you guys mentioned the chemical market and targeted initiatives driving positive sales in the quarter, but you expect the project funnel to decrease. Is this funnel decrease specific to chemical or broad-based in general? And do you have any expectation specific to the chemical market? Andy Silvernail : Yes. So it\u2019s very specific to the niche parts of the market that we serve. I would not use this as a great barometer for the chemical market. We\u2019re probably not the best people to tell you what\u2019s going on strategically in the chemical market. We have had one business unit, in particular, that\u2019s had a wonderful penetration with new products and new markets specifically into China, which has been a big win for us. But even just globally, that business unit has really turned itself and won a bunch of market share. And I think that will continue. And so we feel pretty good about that piece of business in those applications in the markets that we know well. But again, I wouldn\u2019t use this as a general barometer, Francisco. Francisco Amador : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then specific to dispensing, I know sales are \u2013 have been challenging here. And I think you guys said you expect it to be flat for the year. If we could just get a little more color on the nature of the market? Do you have recovery expectations on the longer term and any more details around this? Andy Silvernail : Actually, the core markets are healthy. So if you just kind of look at the core underlying markets, there\u2019s not significant deterioration or anything like that. And I don\u2019t think we\u2019re losing market share. It\u2019s really the nature of these projects that come in and out. So if you think of the big purchasers that are out there, they tend to run in multiyear cycles. And as we look at 2020 \u2013 if you look at kind of the back half of 2019, there was \u2013 we had a pretty good size order in 2018 that we finished out. 2019 was obviously softer in the fourth quarter \u2013 actually through the year in terms of those bigger things. And we don\u2019t have an expectation that one is going to land in 2020. And so what that would say is probably, as we think of 2021, it\u2019s probably likely that we would see one of the big players come back to the market for a refresh, but you just don\u2019t know. So as we\u2019re planning right now, we\u2019re planning on 2020 to not have a big refresh of any kind. Francisco Amador : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you, guys. Andy Silvernail : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brett Kearney with Gabelli Funds. Please proceed with your question. Brett Kearney : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Andy Silvernail : You bet, Brett. Brett Kearney : Your fire business continues to perform well. Can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing in that area, some of the municipal markets you serve. And then how the SAM system is plugging into your overall efforts to serve fire customers? Andy Silvernail : Yes, no problem. So I would say that overall the municipal markets are kind of benign. They are not growing particularly quickly and there \u2013 and we\u2019re not seeing a slowdown from where we\u2019ve been. So it\u2019s very similar. Fire has been, we\u2019ve really \u2013 if you go back to the Akron acquisition back in 2016, and then the small technology acquisition that we made here a little while ago, it\u2019s a combination of those assets that has been driving growth for us. And we would expect low single digits to continue. The strategy that the team has put together there and is playing out in terms of being able to bring more high-value content to customers and now moving more into technology, we think is a winning move is going to play out for a long time. We have seen a lot of interest in SAM. We do have some initial orders, as I\u2019ve said in the past, it\u2019s going to take a long time for this to seed the market to get to a tipping point just because these markets move so slowly and there is already a year backlog. And so you got to kind of work through that, but I would say the initial signals for SAM are really encouraging. Brett Kearney : Thanks so much. Appreciate it. Andy Silvernail : You bet, Brett. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we\u2019ve reached the end of the question-and-answer session. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Andy Silvernail for closing remarks. Andy Silvernail : Well, thank you everybody. I appreciate your time here this morning and your interest in IDEX. I mean, obviously, the world that we\u2019re in right now is challenging, but it\u2019s not unfamiliar, we\u2019ve seen this before. And I think the key to it is, is our ability to really control our own destiny. So, continuing to invest in growth, continuing to drive productivity, continuing to get strategic pricing in the marketplace. And most importantly, investing in our people, that has been the differentiator for us around our culture and we\u2019re going to continue to do that. And I\u2019d like to thank everybody at IDEX for their incredible work that they\u2019ve done over time and really turning this into a wonderful company. So I look forward to talking you all again here in the next 90 days. Take care. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to our host, Mike Yates, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer. Thank you. You may begin. Mike Yates : Thank you, Diago. Good morning, everyone. This is Mike Yates, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for IDEX Corporation. Let me start by saying thank you for joining us for a discussion of the IDEX first quarter 2020 financial highlights. Last night, we issued a press release outlining our company\u2019s financial and operating performance for the three months ending March 31, 2020. The press release, along with the presentation slides to be used during today\u2019s webcast, can be accessed on our company\u2019s website at www.idexcorp.com. Joining me today is Andy Silvernail, our Chairman and CEO; and Bill Grogan, our Chief Financial Officer. The format for our call today is as follows. We\u2019ll begin with Andy providing an overview of IDEX performance drivers and addressing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, as well as the company\u2019s response to date. Bill will then discuss our first quarter 2020 financial results and walk you through an assessment of the company\u2019s liquidity and financial durability through several scenarios. And finally, Andy will conclude with our current framework for second quarter and closing remarks. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. If you should need to exit the call for any reason, you may access a complete replay beginning approximately two hours after the call concludes by dialing the toll-free number 877-660-6853 and entering conference ID number 13694804, or you may simply log on to our company\u2019s homepage for the webcast replay. Before we begin a brief reminder, this call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the Safe Harbor language in last night\u2019s press release and in IDEX\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Andy Silvernail. Andrew Silvernail : Thank you, Mike. I appreciate everyone joining the IDEX Q1 earnings call today. I\u2019m starting off on Slide 6. The world is spinning with great uncertainty. But as you leave this call today, I want you to feel certain about one thing, IDEX is well-positioned to survive and thrive through this COVID-19 crisis. We have the quality of businesses, we have the people, and we have the financial wherewithal. We\u2019ve invested our company aggressively over the years to build a very special organization. Most important, we\u2019ve built the culture. We built a culture with incredibly talented teams who run great businesses that matter to the world. Our culture has helped us react very early to this crisis. We\u2019ve made swift and smart decisions to keep our people safe, to keep our businesses moving and ensure liquidity, making sure that we do everything we can to help win this COVID-19 fight. IDEX has an important mission that we capture in four words, :trusted solutions, improving lives.\u201d Our mission has never been more important. In a world consumed with physical, emotional, and the financial impact of COVID-19, IDEX plays a critical role in keeping people safe and healthy, while helping directly with the fight to defeat it. I\u2019m going to move now to Slide 7. There are so many ways that IDEX is in this fight. In our Fluid & Metering segment, we enable food, energy, and industrial supply chains. In Fire & Safety/Diversified, we\u2019ve acted swiftly to quadruple the production of our mobile medical tents used by hospitals as they struggle to handle the surge in COVID-19 cases. And in Health & Science Technologies, we\u2019re making compressors used in ventilators, mobile carts that produce hospital grade air where it\u2019s not available, and compressors for mobile disinfecting sprayers. And, of course, we\u2019re also a critical supplier enabling the genetic sequencing that decoded the RNA of the coronavirus, enabling the development of tests for COVID-19 and its antibodies, as well as finding therapies and hopefully, an eventual vaccine. There are dozens more examples across the company where we bring essential products to a market in need. I\u2019m turning now to Slide 8. I want to pause here for a moment and thank all of our people across IDEX, especially those in manufacturing, shipping, and other roles that require a presence in our facilities. We have robust safety protocols at our sites worldwide to protect our people performing essential jobs. The safety of our people will always be the most important consideration as we continue in this new environment. In a crisis, especially one as devastating as this, your true values are exposed. I\u2019ve never been prouder of the people of IDEX. From the first sign of the COVID-19 crisis in China, our teams have been collaborating, problem-solving, and acting. While great strategy is a product of this crisis, we\u2019re also seeing the best in who we are. I\u2019m now moving on to Slide 9. On March 20, I held a conference call with investors, where I laid out our operating context and our priorities to steer IDEX successfully through this crisis. Much has changed in five weeks, but our point of view and our priorities remain the same. We\u2019ve built our strategy and our operating plans based on four phases of this evolving crisis. I believe we\u2019re now moving out of Phase 1, the acute phase; and into Phase 2, which will be a period of ongoing uncertainty and significant challenge for the next three to six months. There\u2019ll be a little visibility as quarantines are lifted, and we all work to gradually restart the economy safely. During this phase, we expect to see a significant drop in demand and production capability as customers, suppliers, and our own teams are regularly impacted by shutdowns and shortages. The third phase will be learning to live and work with COVID-19. This will require significant changes to much of what we do, and this period will extend until there is a solution that gives people confidence to engage socially and professionally without fear. While this phase will not be easy, we\u2019ve seen from our businesses in China, which have rebounded quickly that we can successfully pivot our approach. The final phase will be the post virus world. I know we all look forward to this day when normal returns. I\u2019m convinced, however, that normal will be redefined just as it has been another severe crisis. Like the Great Depression, the Second World War, 9/11, and The Financial Crisis, there will be significant and permanent societal and economic changes. The coronavirus will shape our lives and our economy in countless ways, some easily predictable and others yet unknown. Over the next 12 to 18 months, as we move through these phases, it is our job as leaders to successfully transverse phases one through three and enter Phase 4 with a company that\u2019s financially strong and an organization that is positioned to thrive. I\u2019m now turning to Slide 10. We\u2019ve outlined four strategies that guide our way to a better future. Our top priority is safety, protecting our teams as we try to remain open to serve customers that are essential to our society. While we are normally highly decentralized, this is a time when we have carefully weighed safety protocols and mandated certain standards worldwide. These have included temperature checks at the beginning of all shifts, guidelines for face coverings, cleaning and sanitizing practices, and processes for addressing a variety of scenarios from COVID-19 cases to possible exposures. Our COVID-19 issues and response team has led the way and regularly provides guidance to our local sites as issues arise. And because of the strong procedures we have in place and the handful of incidences where employees have contracted the virus, few if any coworkers have been quarantined. Not only is this good for business, but it\u2019s great for the health, well-being, and morale of our employees. I\u2019m glad to report that every IDEX employee who has contracted COVID-19 has so far recovered. To ensure business continuity, which is our second priority, we have developed plans for each site to use in the event of a ramp down of operations. We want to ensure these are handled smoothly and in a way that prepares the business to return quickly to operations. We are also regularly addressing supply chain concerns. While our supply chains are generally shorter than many of our other global manufacturers, we have quickly addressed issues from lockdowns and travel restrictions. So far, our business continuity planning, like our security plans, have helped us avoid more significant business disruptions. In the months ahead, we expect we\u2019ll be choppier. This extensive planning and support structure we\u2019ve built should serve our businesses well. Our third area of focus is liquidity. IDEX entered this time with a strong cash position and we have remained cash flow positive since the beginning of the crisis. Our goal is to remain so throughout, protecting our liquidity and our balance sheet. We\u2019re working with our businesses and finance leaders to help them manage through a period unlike anything they\u2019ve seen in their careers. Bill Grogan, our CFO, has instituted daily cash management practices that he is working with all of our leaders across the globe. Finally, we\u2019re playing offense. That means different things in different areas of our business. In some instances, it means pivoting to focus on the needs of customers who are now booming as they\u2019re selling essential products. In other instances, it\u2019s meant helping businesses in need, like we did in Novotema that\u2019s just outside Bergamo in Italy that was closed. Our sister company, PPE in England, stepped in and produce seals for a medical ventilator manufacturer as the Novotema was struggling. Playing offense also means being prepared to accelerate acquisitions when the market unfreezes and a thoughtful approach to share repurchases. With that, I\u2019m going to pause here. I\u2019m going to turn things over to Bill, and he is going to walk you through an overview of our financials and liquidity. William Grogan : Thanks, Andy. I\u2019ll start with our consolidated financial results on Slide 12. Q1 orders of $645 million were down 2% overall and organically. The slowdown in our industrial end markets that we discussed during our previous call was compounded by the impact of the pandemic in most of our geographies and end markets. However, there was positive momentum in our life sciences and pharma businesses. The backlog we\u2019ve built will help fill the decrease in orders we expect in Q2. First quarter sales of $594 million were 4% \u2013 were down 4% overall and 5% organically. Results early in the quarter were better-than-expected in most areas of the business outside of China. But as the impact of COVID-19 ramped, most of our businesses, with the exception of life sciences and pharma, took a negative turn and drove us to the low-end of our guide. Q1 gross margins expanded 10 basis points to 45.7% and were up in all three segments, primarily driven by strong price capture, continued productivity initiatives and discretionary cost control. These actions more than offset the negative margin impact of lower volume leverage. Operating margin was 23.5%, down 30 basis points from the prior year, mainly driven by the dilutive impact of the Velcora acquisition, which had op margin of 8%, but EBITDA margin of 25% and lower volume leverage. This was offset by our gross margin expansion and SG&A cost actions we took in the fourth quarter of last year. Our Q1 effective tax rate was 20%, which was higher than the 19.5% in the prior year due to a reduction in excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation. First quarter net income was $102 million, resulting in an EPS of $1.33, down $0.11, or 8% compared to the prior year EPS. Finally, free cash flow was $72 million, down 5% compared to the prior year, but was 71% of net income, compared to 69% last year. Turning to Slide 13, our liquidity. Free cash flow for the trailing 12 months ending March 31 was $473 million, or 113% of net income. We continue to be well-positioned to weather the current environment. IDEX has consistently generated positive free cash flow in excess of net income through margin expansion, ongoing working capital initiatives and an effective capital allocation philosophy. LTM adjusted leverage was 1.5 times, providing sufficient capacity to fund all of our business needs and allowing us to quickly pivot to offense as the economic environment improves. Leverage increased slightly in the quarter as we drew $150 million on our revolver in late March in response to temporary challenges in the short-term funding markets. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $569 million at the end of the quarter. We also have $642 million of availability under our $800 million revolving credit facility. With cash on hand, available financing and conservative leverage, we are confident in our ability to continue to meet our obligations, fund operations and make critical investments in the business. In relation to $300 million of notes due at the end of the year, we are currently exploring potential options, including availing ourselves to the capital markets. As Andy mentioned, we have put in place additional processes to enhance our focus on liquidity, and we are actively monitoring conditions with our customers and suppliers to ensure that we\u2019re able to maintain positive cash flow and mitigate the impact of a challenging environment on cash and working capital. We\u2019re taking all necessary actions to make sure we\u2019re appropriately positioned to operate effectively during this period. Moving on to Slide 14. While we believe that we are well suited to operate in this environment, we\u2019re continually monitoring the impact of COVID-19 on our operations and are modeling a number of possible scenarios. These examples are meant to give our investors a picture of our durability, not a reflection of what we expect for full-year sales. Under our current cost structure, which reflects the structural actions we took in the fourth quarter of 2019, we believe that our annualized break-even revenue, the point at which we continue to generate positive cash flow, is approximately $1.8 billion, or 30% decrease to our 2019 sales results. To be proactive in this uncertain environment, we have developed a playbook with actions to reduce that break-even point. We\u2019ve identified approximately $120 million worth of additional cost reductions, which will drive our break-even revenue closer to down 35%. This would include bonus actions, eliminating travel, marketing and supplies and many other discretionary cost items. If the conditions warrant it, we\u2019re prepared to take structural cost actions and generate an additional $40 million of reductions, resulting in a break-even revenue point of down 40%. Lastly, although we intend to fund our dividend, if we were to suspend it, our break-even point would be as low as 50% down on an annualized basis. We\u2019re taking all prudent actions to manage discretionary spending, as we continue to gauge the impact of this volatile environment. At this point, we do not believe that further structural actions are necessary, but we\u2019re staying closely tuned into our end markets and supply chains and are prepared to take additional steps if necessary. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Andy to review our current view on the second quarter. Andrew Silvernail : Thanks, Bill. Hey, everybody, I\u2019m on slide 15. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we believe the next three to six months are going to be extremely challenging. Everyone will face the same uncertainty as we reopen the economy safely and execute environment, where COVID-19 exists and impacts operations potentially in waves. While we believe strongly in the IDEX business model and we\u2019re very well-positioned, we acknowledge the challenges that we face across our business units. We expect revenue in the second quarter could be down as much as 15% to 25%. We know that some of our end markets will be significantly challenged, but those headwinds will be somewhat offset as we continue to deliver mission-critical components to essential customers worldwide. We\u2019ve taken prudent actions to significantly reduce our discretionary cost across our businesses and the steps we took in the fourth quarter of 2019 have positioned us to react to a market that is significantly more challenging than we expected when we started the year. We are closely monitoring our markets and our businesses and we will react quickly to changes. To conclude, I\u2019m extremely proud of how our employees have responded to this crisis. And even though the next 12 to 18 months will be challenging for all of us, I know that we will meet this challenge and come out stronger on the other side. With that, let me pause here and turn it over to questions from the audience. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we\u2019ll be conducting our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Deane Dray with RBC. Please state your question. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Andrew Silvernail : Good morning, Deane. Hey, it\u2019s great to hear the IDEX team, and I\u2019m wishing everyone the best. I appreciate the \u2013 all the details in terms of the potential scenarios this morning. And the first question really picks up where Bill left off on Page 14 on those scenarios\u2026 Andrew Silvernail : Yes. Deane Dray : \u2026because Andy, I want to say for the past year, you\u2019ve been asked about the IDEX playbook for a normal recession. Andrew Silvernail : Yes. Deane Dray : And it really feels like \u2013 I don\u2019t even know what that is anymore, because we\u2019re far beyond that. Andrew Silvernail : Even do we, Deane. Deane Dray : So it\u2019s just \u2013 the idea here, as you said, if things progress or get worse, it just feels like we\u2019re already there. Andrew Silvernail : Yes. Deane Dray : So talk about it, and I know this is a tough conversation, but the deep \u2013 deeper cuts that you\u2019re likely going to have to take, like is that $120 million of cost out, is that enough? What\u2019s \u2013 what are the milestones that you\u2019re looking for here and then maybe some comments on decrementals? Andrew Silvernail : Yes, you bet. So, first of all, that first look at the $120 million, that stuff that we are very actively putting our arms around and taking the cost out of. And obviously, you can see that it even impacted in a positive way to some degree in the first quarter, because we started those actions really as we are coming into February and early part of March, and so there\u2019s some benefits there. So, we\u2019re grabbing that lever already, and we\u2019re grabbing it very aggressively, Deane. So that\u2019s the first thing. One of the main priorities that I have going through this crisis is to maintain as much of the structure and the talent that we can in IDEX appropriately. And so, I\u2019m willing for a short period of time to eat some of the incremental costing to maintain that talent base and to position the company well. That being said, as you know, we\u2019re a very diversified and decentralized business. And so, you have companies that \u2013 some companies are absolutely growing in this environment and some are really taking it on the chin. And so, we\u2019ll have to get the appropriate footprint in the appropriate places depending upon how much deeper and how much longer this goes. And \u2013 but our first priority is to certainly keep the integrity of IDEX intact as much as possible. So, I look at that that secondary group of actions, that the incremental $40 million as steps that we will take if we have to, but would prefer not to, Deane. In terms of decrementals, if you look at it on a sequential basis versus year-over-year, I think, that\u2019s probably a good way to look at it. Obviously, we\u2019re a very high contribution margin company. So, we\u2019re \u2013 we have contribution margins in the low-60s. And so, if we can offset a good chunk of that and end up in the 40s or 50s without having to make massive structural changes to the company, we would do so within the short term. But obviously, in the longer-term, you\u2019ve got to have the appropriate cost structure. Deane Dray : That\u2019s really helpful. And then I just \u2013 I appreciate the four phases that you\u2019ve laid out. And I don\u2019t want to minimize how much heavy lifting, and frankly some pain to get through all four of these phases. But looking beyond into that new normal and maybe the idea of when you will start to shift to offense\u2026 Andrew Silvernail : Yes. Deane Dray : \u2026and you\u2019ve got balance sheet now. You didn\u2019t chase expensive deals the last couple of years. When does M&A make sense? We know markets have to normalize a bit, but when do you start to flip the switch and play offense here? Andrew Silvernail : Well, some of that is in our control and some is not. In terms of overall playing offense, we\u2019re doing some of it right now, Deane. We are \u2013 if you look across our businesses, those places where essential products are booming, so disinfection, many of our Health & Science markets, pharma reshoring, which we think is going to be a major trend. We\u2019re playing offense now. We have redirected our people and investment and are making sure that we can first and foremost help with this fight but also make sure that we\u2019re doing the right things for our shareholders, our owners. And so, some of that\u2019s happening now. As it regards to M&A, there are really two challenges with M&A. First \u2013 the first one is having enough confidence in your own situation to deploy that liquidity in that balance sheet, and the second is that you have willing sellers. We are doing an awful lot of work right now on both sides of that equation. So let me talk about the liquidity side. So, there\u2019s liquidity that is to survive that a lot of people are having to utilize. And at the end of this, they will have a stretched balance sheet in the very difficult circumstances. That is not our situation, and I don\u2019t want it to be our situation. Our drive and why we have so much focus on this breakeven level of cash flow is because I want a balance sheet that is deployable \u2013 aggressively deployable as the world starts to settle itself. And so, if we can maintain this north of $1 billion of liquidity, as cash flows become more certain and the markets stabilizes, we will get aggressive, no doubt about that. Now the other side of that equation is who are the sellers. And so, as you can imagine right now, and you guys are talking to a lot of folks, that\u2019s frozen \u2013 it\u2019s just a frozen marketplace. I think it will take through a quarter or so for that to start to unfreeze when Boards of Directors and families are going to look at this situation and recognize that it\u2019s going to take a while and that an attractive price in this marketplace might make sense. But I think it will take a little bit of time, Deane. Deane Dray : Thank you, and best of luck to everyone. Andrew Silvernail : Thanks, Deane. Operator : Thanks. Our next question comes from Mike Halloran with Baird. Please state your question. Michael Halloran : Hey, good morning, everyone. Andrew Silvernail : Good morning, Mike. William Grogan : Good morning, Mike. Michael Halloran : So a couple of things. First, when you look at that down 15% to 25%, what\u2019s that predicated on? Is that based on what you\u2019re seeing now? Are there signs of stability after that initial shock downward? Any kind of context on what kind of logic you\u2019re using to get to the 15% to 25% down? Andrew Silvernail : Yes. So I\u2019d \u2013 what I\u2019d first say is that the 15% is our experience as March unfolded and what we\u2019re seeing here in early April. And being a short cycle business, we certainly saw the reaction pretty quickly, both on the ups and the downs, by the way, in terms of the things that are struggling. The industrial businesses are certainly taking it on the chin, more so than other businesses. So if you look at FMT, that\u2019s just going to be more painful there. You\u2019ve got the combination of the coronavirus impact and then, of course, what\u2019s happening in the energy world that that\u2019s unfolding. So that 15% is what we\u2019ve been experienced here for, call it, six, seven weeks, Mike. My view is, it\u2019s likely to get worse than the 15%, and we see kind of slippage happening in a number of places that especially have more impact if you\u2019ve got, say, if you\u2019re in energy, you\u2019re in transportation, those places, in particular, are really getting pounded and others are holding up. So I feel pretty comfortable with that range, Mike. Michael Halloran : And then you alluded to it earlier, but maybe just talk about how you guys are thinking about what the structural changes could look like here? What are some of the things that you\u2019re thinking you might rotate to, obviously, some of the pharma medical stuff you\u2019ve already mentioned? Andrew Silvernail : Yes. Michael Halloran : Anything else you\u2019re thinking about? And then how do you prepare for it in the short-term here and bounce that with all the other things as you have up in the air? Andrew Silvernail : Yes. I think one of the things that really works in our favor in this environment is our structure. It could be an impediment. We put that rapid response team in place very early on, because we knew that, that our decentralization and in terms of kind of how we\u2019re structured worldwide, we knew that we could end up with kind of 45 different answers. And so there were certain things that you just couldn\u2019t have 45 different answers on, and we\u2019ve been able to move very quickly. In this case, in terms of playing offense, Mike, our structure helps us a ton, because the places that are really struggling with massive demand falloffs, you can isolate them specifically and you can start redirecting resources to things that are exciting. I\u2019ll give you an example. So in the world of Health & Science, we have a significant demand for engineering right now because of all the new things that are developing, whether it\u2019s from testing, which you\u2019re seeing PCR tests take off that we\u2019re helping with, we needed engineering and we actually redirected engineering from our business in rescue to help our business in Health & Science. And so we\u2019re doing a bunch of things like that, Mike. So we\u2019re definitely moving to those opportunities and moving people and resources. In terms of the big structural changes that they\u2019re \u2013 I think they\u2019re going to happen around a lot of things touching our Health & Science world. I think if I think about, say, the food, supply chain, that\u2019s going to be an area that I think will be impacted. There\u2019s a lot of talk of reshoring in terms of moving things out of more difficult or more risky environments. I think that will happen, that was already happening, but it\u2019s not like a big boom, I think, it\u2019s a relatively slow phase. But overall, I feel like we\u2019re positioned well and our structure really helps us move to the areas where opportunity and demand are likely to be and move away from places they\u2019re likely to be hit harder. Michael Halloran : Thanks for that. And then one, just clarification on Slide 14, the break-even cash flow. Andrew Silvernail : Yes. Michael Halloran : Is that a free cash flow before CapEx or after CapEx? Andrew Silvernail : After. Correct, Bill? Michael Halloran : All right, great. Thank you. I appreciate it. Andrew Silvernail : Bill, that\u2019s right, isn\u2019t it? William Grogan : Yes. Andrew Silvernail : Yes. Michael Halloran : Yes, great. I thought, so I just want to make sure. I appreciate it. Andrew Silvernail : Yes. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Graham with Rosenblatt Securities. Please state your question. Scott Graham : Hey, good morning. And as usual, Andy, thank you for your frankness and clarity. Andrew Silvernail : Yes. Thanks, Scott. Scott Graham : Oh, sure. So I just want to make sure that, we\u2019re \u2013 that I\u2019m at least thinking about what you\u2019re saying about decrementals correctly. So if we\u2019re at 15% to 20% thinking for decline in this quarter\u2019s sales, if I choose the midpoint and say minus 20%, just for example sake\u2026 Andrew Silvernail : Yes. Scott Graham : \u2026taking that number, multiplying it by 50% and that\u2019s your decline in operating income this quarter, it is as simple as that, right? Andrew Silvernail : Yes, plus or minus. Yes. Scott Graham : Okay. Andrew Silvernail : Yes, that\u2019s close enough. Yes. Scott Graham : And within that, how much of the $120 million discretionary are we talking about? In other words, what I\u2019m trying to get to here is that\u2026 Andrew Silvernail : Oh, I gotcha. Yes. Scott Graham : \u2026if it\u2019s $50 million this quarter, next quarter, it could be $40 million and so on, that would be helpful? Andrew Silvernail : Okay. I think I understand your question, Scott. But if I don\u2019t get it, right, just reiterate or help me out here. So the $120 million is an annual number, right? And because we\u2019re not that seasonal and our fixed cost structure doesn\u2019t \u2013 isn\u2019t that variable, you could basically take the $30 million a quarter. And that that\u2019s going to come out of there. And that\u2019s pretty much coming out now. It might be a little bit more as time goes on, but that \u2013 that\u2019s coming up pretty darn rapidly. And that\u2019s what enables you to go from instead of having to be a 62% or 63% negative flow through, that\u2019s what helps you kind of ratchet or ratchet that down over time. So, Bill, is there anything you\u2019d add there? William Grogan : No, I think some of the items may be a little bit less in the second that would ramp up, but it\u2019s close. Scott Graham : Okay, okay. That\u2019s\u2026 Andrew Silvernail : Does that answer your question, Scott? Scott Graham : Yes. For all intents and purposes, the $30 million quarterly is kind of the exit rate right now? Andrew Silvernail : Yes. It\u2019s \u2013 I mean, we\u2019ve clamped down so hard here that we\u2019re not spending money on things that don\u2019t have kind of a direct that aren\u2019t essential, right? That $120 million is really clamping that down. Scott Graham : Okay, gotcha. Two other questions. What would be the trigger for the $40 million? What level of sales? Is it this 35% to 40% decline in sales, that\u2019s the trigger for the structural? Andrew Silvernail : There is, to some degree, Scott, it is an amount. But more than anything else, it\u2019s what we think the duration is going to look like, right? So if we\u2019re going to reset the business, let\u2019s just say, down 20%, let\u2019s just use that number, just as an example. And you\u2019re no longer a $2.5 billion company, you\u2019re now a $2 billion company. You have to have a different cost structure, right, if you think that\u2019s going to be sustained for a period of time. And so that\u2019s what we\u2019re really trying to evaluate is, what we think the duration and the depth is likely to be and it\u2019s a combination of those two that would trigger us to look at the $40 million. We didn\u2019t feel like we had to do that today. We felt like we should buy ourselves some time, and we have with the $120 million. And so we\u2019ll continue to evaluate that, as you know, we took out a big chunk here. In the fall, we took out $15 million and we had another $5 million, which obviously we\u2019ve gone and got. So we were \u2013 although, we hadn\u2019t predicted this, we did predict a tough year. And so we went and proactively got that $20 million out. And so we\u2019ll decide on depth and duration here as we go through this quarter to figure out whether or not we want to take out the other $40 million. Scott Graham : Gotcha. That\u2019s very clear. And then I think you actually in that answer, just answered my third question, which was sort of the way that Slide 14 was structured to do 30%, 35% and 40% and higher revenue declines, that is both depth and duration in these numbers, right? Andrew Silvernail : It is, yes. Scott Graham : Right, because your organic \u2013 you\u2019re thinking for the second quarter if it\u2019s minus 15% to 25%, even if it ends up at 25%, what you\u2019re talking about here is, on an annualized basis, there would be a duration here that would get us to these numbers? Andrew Silvernail : That\u2019s right, Scott. And I want to be very clear Bill said that in his remarks, but just so everyone hears this correctly. We are not \u2013 do not use these as guidance for where we think the world is going. This is really, for example, only, and we\u2019re trying to get a couple of messages across here and I think probably they\u2019ve landed, but just in case. Message one was, there\u2019s a lot that can happen in this world before we become \u2013 before we have a cash flow issue. And therefore, we don\u2019t have a liquidity issue. We have tons of liquidity, but we\u2019re not going to \u2013 I don\u2019t believe we\u2019re going to have to utilize that liquidity to stay afloat. I want to utilize that liquidity to play really aggressive offense. And so, hopefully, that came across the number one, we\u2019re a great position from a cash flow standpoint; and number two, our liquidity is really being pointed towards playing offense from the moment is correct aggressively. Scott Graham : Yep. Page 14 is much clearer to me now. Thank you, guys. Andrew Silvernail : Great. Thanks, Scott. Operator : Our next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please state your question. Nathan Jones : Good morning, everyone. Andrew Silvernail : Hey, Nathan. Nathan Jones : I guess, I\u2019ll go a little further on the cash flow side. Slide 14, here, we\u2019re looking at revenue changes and expense changes. Maybe we could look at the working capital side of this. Andrew Silvernail : Yes. Nathan Jones : I guess, you should clearly have some source of cash out of inventory. Andrew Silvernail : Yes. Nathan Jones : Maybe you can talk about, what you\u2019re expecting there? If you\u2019re seeing any slowdown in DSOs, or changes in receivable collections or any changes in customer behaviors, maybe they\u2019re getting stressed out? Any more color you can give us on that side of the equation? Andrew Silvernail : Yes. I\u2019ll comment on this and then Bill, I\u2019ll let you comment on it also. From \u2013 in terms of how we\u2019re managing this, I think this in a couple of ways. The first one is inventory. We got to make sure it comes out naturally, as volume gets affected, right? And that is \u2013 that has been a winning move in any slowdown for us. And historically, we have taken out inventory, and that\u2019s obviously had a very positive cash effect in any kind of slowdown. So you should expect us to continue to do that and take cash off the balance sheet, or cash out an inventory rather in \u2013 on the balance sheet. In terms of payables and receivables, my philosophy here is don\u2019t be the bank, meaning, we can\u2019t get caught between customers and suppliers. At the same time, I want to be very careful about not damaging customers and suppliers in here. So if we can end up neutral in that regard and really play that strategically, I think, that\u2019s important. Obviously, we\u2019ve got suppliers that we want to make sure they are healthy, they\u2019re our partners, this is not a time to beat on them when they\u2019re struggling, at the same time, we can\u2019t finance them. And so, as our customers are coming to us and asking for a relief, we\u2019re really weighing that against what we can do across the working capital spectrum. And so, we\u2019re being pretty firm. We\u2019ve got excellent service levels, we\u2019ve got great lead times competitively. We\u2019re not going to become the bank. Nathan Jones : Okay. So the target, payables and receivables, net cash neutral and inventories at source? Andrew Silvernail : Yep. Nathan Jones : Okay. My second question is on pricing. You guys have reported positive net pricing every year for as long as I can remember, including 2009. Andrew Silvernail : Yes. Nathan Jones : This is clearly a little different thing, maybe a little steeper in the short-term here. Do you guys think you can still be net price positive or at least net price neutral in this kind of environment? Andrew Silvernail : I\u2019m pretty hopeful that we can stay positive. The price that we put out in the beginning of the year is \u2013 was already out and going. And so I don\u2019t see why that won\u2019t stick. I think there will be some challenges next year as we think about pricing about whether or not we can \u2013 how aggressive we can be there. Bill, on those two topics, do you want to \u2013 you want to give your your view? William Grogan : Yes. I would say, our price capture in the first quarter was in line with what we experienced for most of last year. And I guess, my only comment on the working capital piece is, there are some selective businesses that took some actions to target to build some buffer stock relative to supply chains in certain countries that were shutting down. So first quarter inventory performance was good, impacted slightly based upon some of those builds. And to Andy\u2019s point, we fully anticipate to bleed that off here in the second quarter. But price capture is still strong across the portfolio. Nathan Jones : Bill, what\u2019s your view of price here as we think about the \u2013 this year unfolds? William Grogan : I mean, obviously, we\u2019ll hear more challenging as we go through the balance of the year, as customers are more impacted. But I think our core pricing initiatives that we have across the portfolio will remain positive. Does it come down slightly potentially, but overall, price costs still positive for us. Nathan Jones : Yes. Okay, thanks a lot. I\u2019ll pass it on. Andrew Silvernail : Thanks, Nathan. Operator : Our next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please state your question. Allison Poliniak-Cusic: Hi, guys, good morning. Andrew Silvernail : Hey, good morning, Allison. Allison Poliniak-Cusic: So, Andy, I just want to talk maybe higher level. IDEX, you build a really solid foundation here, you\u2019ve talked about that. Andrew Silvernail : Yes. Allison Poliniak-Cusic: And then you mentioned through these phases, but particularly as we go to that normal \u2013 the new normal, is there anything that\u2019s really coming to light here in terms of portfolio growth? It sounds like you\u2019re starting to pivot some of that near-term organic investment to some of these new applications. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense if that\u2019s temporary or if it\u2019s sort of potentially a new direction here for IDEX? Andrew Silvernail : Yes. So I think \u2013 we\u2019ve had a lot of things come out of us, Allison, in terms of opportunities that \u2013 where people have come to us on trying to help with very specific things relative to the COVID-19 crisis. And as we have evaluated those, we\u2019ve been pretty careful. And what I mean by that is, what we don\u2019t want to do is take a bunch of people and resources and shift them to something where the lead time is so long, that effectively when you bring your solution to bear, it doesn\u2019t matter anymore. And so there are going be a bunch of boom and bust cycles in this \u2013 of different things that are coming to market, both because they\u2019re very effective and then they\u2019re just no longer needed, or they weren\u2019t particularly effective and they wash away. And so we\u2019re trying to avoid those kinds of things. And we\u2019re trying to move the portfolio to things that are really about helping a fight, where we have capabilities and we can ramp really quickly. And I use the the mobile medical tents out of our Vetter unit in Germany. We sold more in the month of March and we sold as much in the month of March, as we sold all of last year. And so we\u2019ve ramped that up. They\u2019ve literally quadrupled their overall capacity here as we go through the \u2013 with the rest of this year. And so that, that makes a ton of sense. It doesn\u2019t take any major investment or capability that we don\u2019t have. So we\u2019re moving to those sorts of things very aggressively. As we think longer-term, I think there are some trends here that are very natural for us. So obviously, around global testing that was already a trend that was growing and it was what we had positioned ourselves behind an IDEX Health & Science, and that is going to accelerate, I think, that\u2019s indefinite. And what I mean by testing is testing to kind of anything and everything that analytical equipment is used for and biodiagnostic testing is used for. That stuff is just going to continue to grow very aggressively and we\u2019re going to continue to position ourselves against that. And then things like, I think the pharma reshoring is the real deal. And so our material process business, as an example, will absolutely play in that. And I think that\u2019s going to be a long-term trend. It\u2019s going to take a long time for that to happen. But I believe that sort of thing is going to develop. And then you have kind of all those other trends that I think are going to get accelerated, because people frankly, have had to change their lives so much, that it\u2019s going to be easier to move into some of these trends. I\u2019m thinking trends like digitization, mobile communications, and how that impacts even, say, a viking pump, where the customer is going to become a lot more comfortable utilizing and expecting digital results and information-based results, and I think that will move some of those things forward faster. Allison Poliniak-Cusic: Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then you mentioned China, it sounds like it\u2019s coming out of \u2013 it\u2019s coming through this and going into the recovery phase\u2026 Andrew Silvernail : Yes. Allison Poliniak-Cusic: As this rolls through globally, any lesson learned or your approach has evolved differently as you hit each region based on what\u2019s been going on in China? Any color there? Andrew Silvernail : Yes, that\u2019s a great question, Allison. And I think kind of moving from East to West in terms of how this has \u2013 this crisis has unfolded, we\u2019ve been learning along the way and we\u2019ve done a few things. So our Chinese businesses, they really lead the way here in creating protocols for safe working. And we have every single one of our plants is up right now. Not everything\u2019s at full capacity, but even our places in Northern Italy are up and working. And I\u2019ll give a lot of credit to that, because we learned very early on how to ramp down, how to ramp back up and how to work in an environment, where the virus is with you. And we\u2019ve created a protocol and a playbook out of that. We then changed that and augmented that for different parts of the world. And we actually very soon, we actually shared that with the Mapi Group, the Manufacturers Alliance for Productivity & Innovation, we shared with them that and they shared it with all of their members. And our team just did a great job putting that together. And so that that\u2019s the basis of that and we\u2019re continuing to learn. We also here, I guess, it was last week, we did a general managers call, a global general managers and site managers call and we had four of our general managers from Italy on that call, taking people through their experience. And I mean, the physical experience of what they\u2019ve gone through the emotional side of it, how to keep people safe, we did a kind of a virtual lunch and learn for everybody around those learnings. And so one of the things that we\u2019re trying to leverage here is the network effect of having so many sites around the world, where we can learn and share and get the best practices out in people\u2019s hands. So we\u2019ve been trying to do that really intently, Allison. Allison Poliniak-Cusic: It sounds great. Stay safe, everybody. Thanks. Andrew Silvernail : Thank you, Allison. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen. Please state your question. Joseph Giordano : Hey, guys, good morning. Andrew Silvernail : Good morning, Joe. Joseph Giordano : So you guys just closed an energy deal. I know it\u2019s a kind of a specific niche technology. Can you just talk about your overall exposure there? What you\u2019re seeing in the way you guys play in the energy markets? Andrew Silvernail : Yes. So, Joe, I think as you know, we are principally a midstream player. And so we\u2019re not really anywhere near the wellhead, for the most part, we have some things here and there, but not a ton. Look, across the energy business, which today is sub-10% of our total portfolio, we have an expectation that that\u2019s really going to get hammered here. So far we haven\u2019t had that \u2013 it hasn\u2019t been as severe as we expected to be, but we are certainly seeing all of those indicators now on the order front. And so we\u2019ll have to get our cost structure right and our overall footprint right to make sure that we can sustain there. We \u2013 I think everybody learned the lesson in 2015, 2016 that the overall impact of capital spending and how the energy economy impacts the global economy can\u2019t be overestimated, right? It\u2019s \u2013 that that\u2019s going to be \u2013 obviously, it\u2019s going to exacerbate this whole situation. And we\u2019re going to have to make sure that our businesses are positioned correctly as we go forward. But thankfully, we\u2019re not in the \u2013 on the wellhead and seeing some of these just ridiculous declines. And we will see declines, but it won\u2019t be like we\u2019re seeing upstream. Joseph Giordano : When you think about, I mean, it\u2019s hard now to think about like new investments you have to make when you\u2019re trying to rip out costs at the same time. But\u2026 Andrew Silvernail : Yes. Joseph Giordano : \u2026as you think about your global footprint, does something like this make you have to step back and like rethink the way you even have your facility set up? Like does the workflow have to look different in the future? Do we have to\u2026 Andrew Silvernail : Yes. Joseph Giordano : \u2026the headcount has to be totally different and it has to be more automated? Like what kind of \u2013 how do you just think about how your global plants look coming out of this? Andrew Silvernail : Joe, I think, that question as we move now through that, what I call Phase 3, is going to be one of the most important questions that we\u2019re wrestling with, because when you think about a manufacturing facility, especially one that is principally assembly and test, I mean, obviously, we do have businesses that are more than that. But we tend to be like machining, assembly and test and we have a couple of businesses that have the foundries and that\u2019s pretty unusual, though. In a world like that, obviously, we\u2019ve all embraced lean manufacturing here for many decades. And the natural output of lean manufacturing is cellular manufacturing, which does not work with social distancing the way it\u2019s constructed today, people are not six-feet apart. And so we\u2019re already in the process of doing that is how do you see the elements, how do you keep the elements of lean manufacturing, which is the elimination of waste and bringing down lead times? How do you keep those while having the principles of social distancing in place, and that\u2019s something that we\u2019re working on. I know a lot of people are. And we\u2019re not going to move to batch manufacturing. We\u2019re not going to do that sort of thing and destroy three decades of great work. But it does change how people work and not just in the manufacturing environment, it\u2019s going to change in the office environment, it\u2019s going to change it how we interact with customers. So many things like that are going to change and tell people have that comfort to be closer together again. Joseph Giordano : Thanks for the color. Andrew Silvernail : Thank you, Joe. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg. Please state your question. Andrew Buscaglia : Hey, guys. Andrew Silvernail : Hey, Andrew. Andrew Buscaglia : If you could talk \u2013 I\u2019m getting the sense directionally for the year, FMT gets hit probably the worst and then Fire & Safety maybe second worst and then Health & Science maybe third worst, because there are some partial offsetting factors. Would you agree with that? Andrew Silvernail : I would. Yes. Andrew Buscaglia : Okay. In those other segments, are there \u2013 we\u2019re talking about some partially offsetting factors, maybe in Health & Science. Are there any in the other two segments? Is there anything else you\u2019re seeing that could go the other way as a positive? Andrew Silvernail : Yes, yes. So I think, as you look at, say, let\u2019s look at FMT first. I think that, obviously, the whole agricultural space has been really beaten up. But I do believe that the food supply chains are going to be continued to be really critical. And I think that\u2019s an overall a good trend as you talk about Ag in terms of where we play there. And that would be both for the material handling business, material process business and for Banjo. I put in both of those. Our ABS business, we are seeing some benefits of actually \u2013 there\u2019s some very interesting analytics that can be done for what\u2019s going on in sewer systems, believe it or not, I know that sounds incredibly strange. But there\u2019s a whole bunch of modeling that \u2013 and analytics that are allowed to or can happen because of our ability to monitor those systems. So our ABS business, we think will probably hold up pretty well in there. And then I think that the more industrial facing, kind of general industrial is going to have a bunch of things that are pretty negative, offset by small things that are positive. So, example, if you\u2019re selling into the chemical industry, obviously, there are some chemicals around disinfectants and things like that, that are absolutely booming. And then you have other things that are going into large CapEx that are likely to really struggle. So there are a few trends there over and diversified. On the Fire side, the \u2013 interestingly enough, there are a number of applications, where you can use some of that technology for disinfectant. So you\u2019ll see some of that. You\u2019ve got a really long \u2013 very, very long pipeline of \u2013 for \u2013 in the fire business for trucks in the U.S., particularly you\u2019ve got over a year of backlog. What we don\u2019t know yet is, whether or not we\u2019ll see cancellations. We have not seen that yet, but we\u2019ll have to monitor that pretty closely. The \u2013 we\u2019ve seen in China the rescue business pick back up aggressively has slowed down as tenders slowed down and then has picked back up aggressively. And so I think those hold up. BAND-IT and dispensing both, I think, take it on the chin here in the short-term because of their exposure one, around the retail space and for dispensing and then for BAND-IT, you\u2019ve got some exposure to transportation and oil and gas that will get hit, but other parts will do quite well. Andrew Buscaglia : Okay, yes, that\u2019s good \u2013 that\u2019s some good color. Andrew Silvernail : Thanks. Andrew Buscaglia : If you could \u2013 maybe just one last question on \u2013 same question, but related to margins. I would think FMT would get hit hardest, because it seems like in Fire & Safety, you\u2019ve got some \u2013 you\u2019ve made some changes there that structurally, and maybe those are okay or not okay, but fair better than FMT. Is that safe to say in terms of the decline we\u2019ll see? Andrew Silvernail : Yes, I think FMT will fair \u2013 will be the most challenged and then diversified and then Health & Science. Andrew Buscaglia : Okay, yes. Okay. Got it. Thank you. Andrew Silvernail : Yes. Thanks, Andrew. Operator : Our next question comes from Brett Linzey with Vertical Research Partners. Please state your question. Brett Linzey : Hey, good morning, everyone. Andrew Silvernail : Good morning, Brett. Brett Linzey : I wanted to come back to your comment on the past six to seven weeks, you mentioned you\u2019re running down mid-teens. Andrew Silvernail : Yes. Brett Linzey : What does the range look like there? And then just thinking about the complexion across the geographies, as we do reopen commerce, how are you thinking about the pace of return between the U.S. and Europe? Andrew Silvernail : Yes. Just to make sure I understand, Brett, the question you\u2019re asking, are you asking kind of the range of outcomes kind of business-by-business, like how bad to how good? Is that what you\u2019re asking? Brett Linzey : Well, I mean \u2013 yes, I mean, you\u2019re saying on average things around mid-teens. Andrew Silvernail : Yes. Brett Linzey : I mean, there\u2019s probably some growth in there, which does imply \u2013 there\u2019s some businesses down 30%, 40%, is that the right way? Andrew Silvernail : Yes. We\u2019ve got a couple of businesses that we think are going to be down in that 40% range. Very few are \u2013 is that severe, but they \u2013 you do have a couple. And again, it\u2019s energy, transportation exposure, we don\u2019t have really hospitality exposure, so to speak, so we don\u2019t have that. But we do have some businesses that are down there that much. And we expect we\u2019ll probably in the next quarter or two, we\u2019ll have that kind of impact. We don\u2019t think that will stay long. And I think that to your your question, our experience in China has been a very, very aggressive snapback and \u2013 but it\u2019s actually bifurcated. You have businesses that are kind of COVID facing, so to speak, that are helping with the fight, that are growing like crazy. And then you\u2019ve got a few businesses that are kind of really in the dumpsters, but it\u2019s actually come back pretty quickly. I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s the model for the rest of the world and for a number of reasons. Obviously, China has some very unique circumstances in how they are able to manage people and businesses and democracies just don\u2019t have those tools. And that\u2019s the cost of democracy, which is, I think, a good cost. And so I think it\u2019s going to look a lot more like we\u2019re seeing in Europe, which is, you\u2019re going to see people starting to figure out how to live with this virus and figure out how can you still have social distancing, but get back to work, get back to friends and family. And so that means, it just takes longer, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing certainly in Italy and that\u2019s what I expect here. And just to be clear, our expectation here is that this is going to be fits and starts. I\u2019m not someone who has bought into a super aggressive, everything gets fine in the fall sort of thing. I think that\u2019s crazy talk. And I think we have to face the reality that\u2019s in front of us. And what if we get lucky and for some reason, this goes away with whether or something else or a vaccine is found more quickly than we think, or you have very, very effective treatments. Great news. I don\u2019t think anybody should bank on that, and I certainly wouldn\u2019t manage the company expecting that. Brett Linzey : Okay, great. No, I appreciate that. Andrew Silvernail : Yes. Brett Linzey : And then just one last one. I was hoping you could spend just a moment. On the evolution of the portfolio, not so much from a product standpoint, you gave a lot of good examples earlier. But just in terms of service or the recurring elements of the portfolio. what\u2019s that mix look like today? I mean, obviously, service is going to be impacted here near-term. But kind of in a new normal, what is the recurring alumni that looks like? Andrew Silvernail : Yes, we\u2019ve never been a company that has the classic sort of high recurring revenue, so to speak. And the reason I say that is that, we don\u2019t have a big parks business, but we tend to sell into like-for-like in a very, very high percentage of our applications. And so, Bill, I don\u2019t know, what\u2019s your estimate of total sort of recurring? How would you characterize that? William Grogan : Yes, it\u2019s greater than 50%. Andrew Silvernail : Yes, I agree with that. And so, look, when you had the financial crisis, our total business was down 14%. during that year right after that over the entire year. Our Health & Science business was down 5%, and I think our industrial businesses were down, say, 20% in those environments, which set itself off. We have a better portfolio positioning than we did then, meaning, it\u2019s less cyclical and there\u2019s more Health & Science in the mix. And so I feel good about that. So overall, I think, our portfolio and our positioning is pretty good. Albeit, there will be a couple of places that will get hit really hard. Brett Linzey : Okay, great. I really appreciate all the detail. I hope everybody stay safe. Andrew Silvernail : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Walter Liptak with Seaport Global. Please state your question. Walter Liptak : All right. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Andrew Silvernail : Good morning. Wal. Walter Liptak : I wanted to ask a question about the municipal businesses. Your comments so far that Fire okay, China picked up pretty quick. They wonder how the municipal businesses you think will do this time? There\u2019s anything different, more challenging either financially or maybe benefits? I think you mentioned the sewer business could have some benefits. I wonder if we could just talk about muni? Andrew Silvernail : Yes. I think historically, the municipal businesses have had 18 months to two-year lag time compared to other businesses. And that\u2019s really driven by receipt, right, especially in the Western world. The \u2013 as you \u2013 as the receipts come in, that really sets the overall operating capital budgets. And so I expect there to be a little bit quicker reaction than you saw in the financial crisis. That \u2013 in the financial crisis, that took time, I remember that well, where the municipal businesses held up really well that we \u2013 as we went into that crisis. And then they started to really struggle as you got into 2008 \u2013 excuse me, 2010, 2011. It \u2013 that took some time for that to make its way through and then had \u2013 obviously had \u2013 has had a pretty strong overall run. I expect that will generally follow a similar path, although, I think it\u2019ll be more. I think people act faster just because it\u2019s been such a shock to the global system and everybody\u2019s top of mind that municipalities are going to probably clamp down a little more quickly on their spending. I expect to see that, but I do think it will still lag the overall industrial economy. Walter Liptak : Okay, great. Thanks. And then last one for me just about the share buyback. I wonder if you can just remind us how much is left\u2026 Andrew Silvernail : Yes. Walter Liptak : \u2026on the share repurchase authorization? And how you\u2019re thinking about it in the second quarter and in the second-half? Andrew Silvernail : Yes, you bet. So we did buy just over $100 million of shares. We had a 10b5-1 in place going into this, and so we did buy just over $100 million. We did shut that 10b5-1 down, as we looked at the value of liquidity and the uncertainty that we were in. We valued this certainty more than we did the incremental share buyback. So we did pause that. Look, I know there\u2019s going to be a lot of \u2013 people are going to be looking really hard at those who buy back shares and I know in some ways it\u2019s turned into a political football. I don\u2019t think that we are in that category number one, obviously, we\u2019re kind of pretty low on the overall visibility food chain here, so I don\u2019t worry too much about that. Second, we\u2019re not going to be a company that takes cash from the government, I can\u2019t see where we\u2019re going to do that in a way that restricts us in any way to our behaviors. And then finally, look, we are going to utilize our liquidity the best way we can to help all of our stakeholders. And if what that means is to buy back shares, then we will do so appropriately. In terms of what we have in total, I can honestly say, we only have the $500 million that we got authorization for back a few weeks ago, plus you add that on, I think, Bill, to what about? William Grogan : It\u2019s a little over $700 million. Andrew Silvernail : Yes\u2026 William Grogan : \u2026.yes, a little over $700 million. Andrew Silvernail : Yes. Walter Liptak : Okay, great. Okay. Thanks, guys. Andrew Silvernail : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Please state your question. Matt Summerville : Thanks. Just a quick one. Most of mine have been answered. But just with respect to life sciences and pharma, the strength you\u2019re seeing there\u2026 Andrew Silvernail : Yes. Matt Summerville : \u2026is that COVID-19-related, or is that something else? And could you put that in the context of the $50 million improvement, I believe, you saw in overall backlog? How that component plays out looking forward? Andrew Silvernail : Yes. You\u2019ve got \u2013 there are two stories in there, Matt. So the first one is yes, there is absolutely a pickup from COVID-related activities. There\u2019s no doubt about that, that we\u2019re seeing in life sciences. But also, we have a number of very important customers that have programs that are ramping. And we have won some substantial business and we had some really nice orders here in the quarter relative to that. And so that\u2019s been strong. So it\u2019s both ongoing programs that are really important and then you\u2019ve got the impact of COVID-19 to get two things going at once. And, Bill, I don\u2019t know what \u2013 in total, what does that make up of the $50 million of backlog, Bill? William Grogan : It was a little over $30 million from HST. Andrew Silvernail : Yes. So that will give you a sense, Matt. Matt Summervill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn it back to management for closing remarks. Andrew Silvernail : Great. Thank you very much, and thank you all for being on the call. I know that we\u2019re sitting in a time that has shaken us in many ways. And I think I\u2019d like to close with a couple of comments. My first one is that, as I said in my prepared remarks, I could not be more proud of how the team here at IDEX has handled this. I have seen a level of collaboration and teamwork and positivity that \u2013 it really warms the heart. It\u2019s just incredible. And when you see that, sometimes the news cycles have a tendency to get you down. And \u2013 but when you see how people are coming together in the real world and tackling this, it is awesome, and it\u2019s why I\u2019m in business. I believe that the purpose of business is to make life better, and I could not be more proud of the team at IDEX for what they\u2019ve done. It\u2019s just remarkable. Second, I\u2019d like to say thank you to, everybody, who is on this call and your interest in IDEX. We \u2013 while the IDEX brand is not well-known in the consumer world, we play a very important role in a lot of places that really do matter. And that mission that I talked about trusted solutions and improving lives, we live that here at IDEX. And we\u2019re seeing in this crisis in this fight with COVID-19 how important that is. And I want to thank the people who are investors in the company and prospective investors for your support, your partnership as we move through this, and we will move through this and we will get to the other side and we will have a very strong company that\u2019s positioned extremely well. So thank you, everybody. I appreciate it and look forward to discussions as we go forward. Take care. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference. All parties may disconnect. Have a great day.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Mike Yates, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for IDEX. Thank you. You may begin. Mike Yates : Great. Thank you, Melissa. Good morning, everyone. This is Mike Yates, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for IDEX Corporation. Let me start by saying thank you for joining us for a discussion of the IDEX second quarter 2020 financial highlights. Last night, we issued a press release outlining our company\u2019s financial and operating performance for the three months ending June 30, 2020. The press release, along with the presentation slides to be used during today\u2019s webcast, can be accessed on our company\u2019s website at www.idexcorp.com. Joining me today is Andy Silvernail, our Chairman and CEO; and Bill Grogan, our Chief Financial Officer. The format for our call today is as follows. We\u2019ll begin with Andy providing an overview of IDEX's second quarter performance and addressing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, as well as the company\u2019s response to date. He will then provide an overview of our primary end markets. Bill will then discuss our second quarter 2020 financial results and walk you through a review of the company\u2019s cost actions, liquidity and financial durability. And finally, Andy will conclude with our current framework for the third quarter and closing remarks. Following these prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. If you should need to exit the call for any reason, you may access a complete replay beginning approximately two hours after the call concludes by dialing the toll-free number 877-660-6853 and entering conference ID number 13694805, or you may simply log on to our company\u2019s homepage for the webcast replay. Before we begin a brief reminder, this call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the Safe Harbor language in last night\u2019s press release and in IDEX\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I\u2019ll now turn this call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Andy Silvernail. Andy? Andy Silvernail : Thanks Mike. I want to start by thanking all the people across IDEX. They've really stepped up with the challenges that COVID-19 has presented and have embraced the evolving protocols along the way. As COVID-19 has impacted families globally, we've not been spared loss here at IDEX, and I want to make sure that all of our teams know how proud we are of their contributions. In a crisis, especially one as devastating as this, your true values are exposed and the culture that we've built at IDEX is stronger than ever. We continue to supply our customers with critically enabling products across the globe, meeting their challenging demands, and partnering with them to rapidly support and develop innovative new products to battle COVID-19. I'm going to share one of those examples here in a few minutes. Our businesses continue to deliver during this pandemic. With our internal safety protocols and resilient supply chain, we've been able to deliver products with limited interruptions. When issues have arisen, the teams have been able to react quickly and mitigate the impact on our business and customers. While we have experienced significant sales increases, our balanced end market exposure and mission critical product offerings have limited these declines. The diversification into various life sciences, pharma, and municipal applications have lessened than the more cyclical declines in energy and general industrial end markets. Also, our operating and finance teams across the globe did an excellent job of deleveraging the balance sheet and helping to drive record second quarter free cash flow. We converted at 193% of adjusted net income.  Finally, we\u2019ve continue to be proactive on mitigating the bottom line impact from the historical economic dislocation created by the virus. We've ramped down all non-essential expenses to mitigate our organic decrementals at less than 40%. We're leveraging and restructuring actions that we took in 2019, along with new actions that were required in several of our businesses that we'll see more prolonged volume impacts. As these organizations right size for the new normal, we've increased investments in several other businesses to capitalize on several short-term COVID-19 opportunities, as well as invest in projects that will support our longer-term growth. We've made -- we've made swift and smart decisions to keep our people safe, keep our business moving, and ensure our financial performance making sure that we do everything we can to help win the COVID-19 fight. Turning to slide seven. We outlined four key strategies to operate in the COVID-19 world in early March. Focusing on this framework has been a key part of our ability to perform across our businesses. From a safety perspective, protecting our teams as we remain open has been our priority. The standards we've implemented globally have been effective in keeping operations consistently running with minimal work stoppages across our facilities. We've evolved our protocols and have implemented mandatory face coverings in all of our facilities to protect our employees and limit the spread of COVID-19. As I mentioned earlier, our operations and supply chain team have done an excellent job ensuring business continuity. We continue to improve our operational preparedness and bolster our supply chain with plans to help avoid business disruptions. We anticipate continued volatility in the months ahead, and the dynamic planning support structure we've built should serve our businesses well. Our actions in the second quarter have minimized any concerns we have with liquidity. We issued $500 million of new bonds to pay off our 2020 notes and bolster our cash position. We had record second quarter cash flow, and we have $746 million of cash on our balance sheet and full capacity on our revolver. The efforts of our teams have put us in great financial position, and we have more than enough capital to fund all of our operational needs due to the pandemic as well as position us to take advantage of other capital deployment opportunities. Lastly, our leaders are spending more time playing offense. Our teams continue to innovate and bring new products to market that capture short-term opportunities, but also lever our portfolio to capitalize on longer-term secular trends that are evolving as a result of pandemic, particularly around testing for viruses and antibodies as well as the creation of a vaccine. I would go into more detail on more of those opportunities here in minute. We also see the M&A markets open up with more deals starting to come through. While it's still going to be a challenging year from an M&A perspective, we're more optimistic in our ability to get a deal done than we were 90 days ago. With that update on the status of the COVID-19 playbook, I'd like to spend a few minutes walking you through one of the products that's a critical technology in the mass production of vaccines. I'm on slide eight. In the HST segment, products from our microfluidics product line within our Materials Processing Technologies' business are keys to help bring a vaccine for COVID-19 to market. Our Microfluidizer processors are key technology used to manufacture the vaccine adjuvants required for several of the vaccine trials. Vaccine adjuvants are immune stimulators added to many vaccines commonly used today. By using an adjuvant in a vaccine, the body can produce a better immune response to the antigen with the germ, while also allowing vaccine manufacturers to be able to produce more doses of vaccine with less antigen.  In addition to vaccine adjuvants, Microfluidizer processors can be used to manufacture lipid nanoparticles, that are key ingredients with a new mRNA style vaccines currently in the pipeline. The team at MPT has done a fantastic job responding to the increasing demands in the market for COVID-19 vaccine testing and preproduction, and has quickly aligned priorities to meet this market need and participate in the fight against the pandemic. This highlights just one of the ways IDEX businesses have answered the call and wholeheartedly embraced our mission of trusted solutions improving lives. We're moving now to slide nine. We've outlined here how we're seeing the current environment impact our primary end markets. In our Fluid & Metering Technology segment, we've seen a broader industrial softness that we called out at the end of 2019, become exacerbated by the pandemic as well as volatility in the oil and gas markets. Our industrial businesses have seen a decline in volume due to the lack of capital investment from our customers. While we've seen the like-for-like replacement sales and these businesses hold up well because the critical nature of its components, the impact of the soft market impact that pandemic and delaying capital projects has led to broader declines. Our water business, while down year-over-year, has held up well as municipal projects have largely been continuing with some delays as municipalities have responded to critical needs of the communities that they serve. Similarly, agriculture has held up reasonably well, given a stronger spring season in U.S. and relatively optimistic demand from growers. In the Health & Science Technology segment, we've seen two bright spots coming from both the opportunities I discussed previously, as well as a strong rebound in the semiconductor market in 2020, which has largely been driven by demand for 5G products. We've seen semicon come out of the downward cycle that they had experienced over the past 18 months. On the other hand, analytical instrumentation, industrial and automotive markets have been impacted significantly. In AI, as the medical industry focused on COVID-19, other investments in lab equipment were delayed and we're just now seeing those investments start to pick up. Auto experience a wide ranging production shutdown significantly impacting our ceiling business. We expect some modest sequential improvement as we move into Q3, but expect these markets to remain challenged in the short, medium term. Moving to Fire & Safety/Diversified. We also saw the automotive and aerospace industry shutdown in the U.S., significantly impact our BAND-IT business. Additionally, we've seen lower capital spending globally impact our dispensing business as many customers are delaying replacement and upgrades, as they assess the pandemic's impact on their business. Our fire and rescue businesses, while countercyclical similar to other municipal businesses, so a non-committed capital projects pushed out due to municipalities prioritizing COVID-19 response and only engage in mandatory equipment purchases. Previously funded projects continue to go and demand for our new products and offerings and fire and rescue are partially offsetting these project delays. As I mentioned previously, we firmly believe in the strength of the IDEX business model. While there will be continued softness to some of our harder hit businesses our diversified end market offerings will mitigate the impact of some of the cyclical declines that we've experienced. Our investments in life sciences, pharma and municipal markets have helped provide countercyclical opportunities that we believe will continue to somewhat offset the weakness in these markets.  With that, let me stop here, and Bill, I'll turn it over to you for the financial results for the quarter. Bill Grogan : Thanks, Andy. I'll start with our consolidated financial results on slide 11. Q2 orders of $522 million were down 17% overall and 18% organically. As Andy just mentioned, the slowdown in our industrial end markets, volatility in oil and gas, and the compounding impact of the pandemic saw year-over-year declines in most of our geographies and end markets. Pacing for the quarter seemed to bottom out in May, with April orders down 18%, May down 23% and June down 13%. Second quarter sales of $561 million were down 13% overall and 17% organically. While we were able to maintain operations effectively and avoided extended facility shutdowns, the interruption of automotive and transportation markets decreased CapEx spending in energy and general industrial and weakness in dispensing led to the organic sales declines. As mentioned before which are relative strengths from a bounce back in semicon and new applications we've developed in response to the pandemic.  Q2 adjusted gross margins declined 290 basis points to 42.6%, primarily driven by lower volume, the diluted impact of acquisitions and business mix, partially offset by strong price capture and cost actions, which I will detail out on the next slide. Second quarter adjusted operating margin was 21.1% down 340 basis points from prior year, mainly driven by lower volume leverage and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by a restructuring actions and discretionary cost controls. Our Q2 effective tax rate was 22.7%, which was higher than the 21.7% in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in the excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation. Second quarter adjusted net income was $84 million, resulting in EPS of $1.10 down, $0.40 or 27% compared to the prior year EPS. Finally, free cash flow was a record of $161 million for the quarter, up 36% compared to prior year period and was 193% of net income. The strong performance was result of significant focus and discipline on working capital management aided by federal tax payments pushed to the third quarter. The teams delever the balance sheet with the lower sales volume, primarily through collecting cash from our customers, past due AR was the lowest it's been in several years.  The reduction of receivables will stabilize with the sales volumes. So, we did not view this level of free cash flow performance sustainable going forward, but we are confident in our ability to drive cash flow conversion in excess of 100% of net income. Moving on to slide 12. As we discussed our Q1 earnings release, we dimensioned our cost structure and identified both discretionary structural cost actions we could take to help mitigate the impact of reduced volume. While our overall adjusted operating income declined $38 million in the quarter, we would have expected the $110 million organic sales decline to have a negative impact on operating income of $66 million and our robust 60% contribution margin rate. This $66 million was offset by $25 million in executed operational actions, $5 million from the impact of restructuring taken in the fourth quarter of 2019 combined with $15 million of discretionary cost controls taken in the quarter, along with $5 million of price and net productivity that was partially offset by negative product and business mix. To reconcile the $15 million of discretionary cost actions for you, we identified $120 million of actions we could take at revenue declines of 35% in our last call. The quarterly impact would have been $30 million with sales down 17%, roughly half of what our scenario depicted, our discretionary savings of $15 million is also about half of the target. While the teams did an excellent job in the second quarter mitigating a revenue decline, we saw the need to take additional restructuring actions in several businesses to rightsize their organizations for their new normal. The additional structural actions that were taken were focused in those businesses that we believe will be --will experience a longer term impact from the pandemic and underlying market softness. These businesses had to make some difficult decisions, but prudently responded to the existing economic circumstances while also supporting their long-term growth initiatives. These actions will provide another $10 million of annualized savings for us starting in the third quarter. Turning to slide 13 on liquidity. Free cash flow for the trailing 12 months ending June 30 was $516 million or 138% of net income. As mentioned before, we continue to be well-positioned to weather the current environment. We expect to generate free cash flow in excess of net income as we focus on cost containment and working capital management. Cash and cash equivalence totaled $746 million at the end of the quarter. We also have full availability of our $800 million revolving credit facility. With cash on hand, available financing and conservative leverage, we are confident in our ability to continue to meet our obligations, fund operations and make critical investments in the business. We're addressed our prior 300 million 2020 notes during the quarter by issuing 500 million of 3% senior notes due in 2030, ensuring that we have adequate liquidity and capital as we pivot the offense. The proactive steps that we executed in the first half to enhance our focus on liquidity and working capital have resulted in record free cash flow for the quarter. And although, we are confident in our current position, we continue to actively monitor conditions with our customers and suppliers to ensure that we're able to react to any market condition. With that, I would like to turn it back over to Andy to summarize our Q3 expectations and provide some final thoughts. Andy Silvernail : Thanks, Bill. I'm on slide 14 folks. As I mentioned last quarter, we believe we will continue to operate in challenging environment. We do not anticipate the economic recovery from this unprecedented situation will be a straight line, and we expect that we will continue to see certain markets remain challenged, while others bounce back more quickly. The strength is in our business model and our people, and we will continue to make prudent decisions to navigate the environment effectively. We feel strongly that the actions we've taken to position in the company to weather the existing environment, but as importantly to rebound strongly as we come out of the other side. We remain well-structured from an operational, talent and financial perspective, but we acknowledged the challenges that we'll face across all of our business units, and we expect that the revenue in the third quarter will be down 12% to 17% organically. While we expect modest sequential growth from some markets that have started to recover, we know that some other markets will continue to be challenged. We're focused on balancing the need to take responsible cost control actions, while investing in areas that will allow us to recover quickly. We look forward to additional ways to play offense and deploy solutions that help in the fight and provide opportunities for us to generate long-term growth. To conclude, I'm extremely proud of how our employees have responded to this crisis. The teamwork that has been displayed as we rolled out evolving safety protocols responded quickly to volatile market conditions and ultimately deliver critical solutions for our customers is a testament to the mission and the values of our company and the great people who are central to the IDEX difference. While we have started to learn how to live and operate in this new world, there'll be further challenges that we face in the coming months. From what I've seen from our team, I have no doubt that we'll continue to meet and overcome these challenges as they come. With that, let me pause here, Melissa, and turn it over for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from line of Mike Halloran with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Mike Halloran : Hey, good morning, everyone. Hope everyone's doing well. Andy Silvernail : Hey, Mike. Mike Halloran : So, let's start kind of where you left off there, Andy. Not a linear recovery from here, maybe some thoughts on how July has shaped up? What kind of assumptions are embedded as you think about the rest of the year and the type of curve or how you think things play out, and then maybe a little bit more timeframe the next year, year and a half? What's the organization planning for as it sits here? Obviously you guys are going to be positioned to be very fluid and be able to attack the problems or opportunities as they come, but what's the base case for improvement as you guys look at and how you're planning for things? Andy Silvernail : Thanks Mike. So, Mike, let me call it -- I'll break this into two parts to that answer. Let me tackle the short-term piece. So, let\u2019s take -- maybe kind of three parts, what's happening right now, what we expect the rest of the year, and as best you can starting to think a little bit about 2021 and the ultimate recovery. Look, short term, July has continued to improve, which is a good sign. So, we did all of our operating reviews here over the last week or so. And I would say pretty consistently across our businesses, we are seeing sequential improvement and that's what gives us confidence to believe that we did hit the bottom in May. You heard Bill talk about sequentially kind of what this looked like, and July is looking a lot like June, maybe even a little bit better than that. And so, barring another kind of global shutdown and/or major issues with this surge that we're seeing, I think we can expect to see this sequential improvement through the balance of the year. And I would guess that when we're talking 90 days from now, we're talking about guidance in the single digit to low-double-digit range on the top line. That's what I'm hopeful for, Mike. But to be clear, that is all with a big caveat of what's happening in the surge in the United States. And also we're seeing really what is a tragic situation in many parts of the emerging world. So, there is a big caveat around all of this. In terms of the longer-term recovery, I'm still very much where I have been since we talked in March on your conference call. And that said, we are going to be in bumpy territory until there is a vaccine. I really do believe that. Obviously, we're pretty close to some of the work that's being done here in our HST segment in particular. I think the news that is out there is good news on what we're seeing relative to the vaccine. But I think we're all learning real time that number one, these vaccines may not be effective. They may take longer -- I would say very optimistic scenarios that are out there right now, and the virus can mutate. And so, our current thinking is very much around, you start to see sequential improvement through the third and the fourth quarter, and I would expect the first quarter, and then you assume you get a vaccine sometime in the first part of the year that gets deployed throughout, I think that's when you start to see a much more aggressive acceleration. Mike Halloran : No. No, that's helpful. And then, second piece on the M&A side, the prepared remarks, tough environment, but a little bit more optimistic. Andy Silvernail : Yeah. Mike Halloran : A couple fold here. One, what is the approach you guys are taking in this environment at a high level? And two, what's driving the optimism behind the thought process? Andy Silvernail : Yeah. So, at a high level, it really is all about staying very close to your knitting. It's pretty hard to do a deal in this environment with something that is an adjacency that you don't know very well. And the reason for that is diligence is just a lot more challenging. We're involved in diligence in a couple of different deals right now. And one is a European based business. One is, is in the U.S. And you just -- it's just not like it was six months ago, you can't kind of physically get out there and do the stuff that you need to do in the way that you have in the past. And so, you've got to know your markets really well, and you've got to know the essential structure of that business and what you can do with that business pretty intimately in this environment. So that's kind of a high level. What we've seen here in the past 60 days is simply more deal flow. More -- people who we've talked to for years and years and years, and we've had relationships with been cultivating, there's more conversation to be had. If you recall one of the questions that was -- I was asked back, I think, on our last call was, how do you get confident? And I said, when you start to feel solid ground around cash flow, and I feel really good about understanding the trajectory of our cash flows. Obviously, we had a phenomenal cash flow quarter. We will get some benefit of more deleveraging in third and fourth quarter with inventory. And so, now I just -- I feel very, very good about our underlying cash flows. And then, therefore, our ability to predict what a business that is similar to us is going to do with these underlying cash flows. Mike Halloran : So, could then you put that also in context of how you're balancing M&A, and then buybacks as we sit here today, pull back on buybacks because of the environment, not because of liquidity and/or maybe feel better about the M&A side, so a better place to put capital. Any thoughts there. Andy Silvernail : Yeah. So, let me answer that in two ways. So, first, we slowed down -- we suspended buybacks in the middle of the quarter or the beginning of the quarter, really. We bought pretty aggressively early on as the stock went down and then, with the -- just incredible uncertainty, we paused it. We did have 10b5-1 in place in the second quarter. And so, we're open to repurchase shares. So, that is -- there's no doubt about it. And we have plenty of both capital availability and authorization from our Board. So, we can do it there. As always Mike, we would much prefer to acquire, right? It builds a business strategically, allows us to compound capital. It creates opportunity for our people. And so that always remains the highest priority after fully funding our business. And so, we're going to continue to push there. Prices have basically remained the same for the most part. And so, the trade off in interest rates and some drop in cash flows because of the pandemic are kind of effectively balancing each other out in terms of valuation. And so, from an overall value perspective, we're kind of where we were six months ago. Mike Halloran : Yeah. No, that makes a lot of sense. I appreciate the time. Andy Silvernail : Yeah. Thanks Mike. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Andy Silvernail : Good morning, Deane. Deane Dray : Andy, if you think back like a year and a half ago, we had investor meetings with you and we talked about what the playbook was in a normal recession. Andy Silvernail : Yeah. Deane Dray : So, like -- clearly, this is anything, but normal. But there's still a playbook that you're running and maybe just want to refresh us on this. So, when I look on slide 12, this is very telling, but just you could amplify a couple points for us. We see the part you cannot control and that's the near-term organic volume and we see what that dropped through is. Now, to the right, we get the total flow through after all of your cost cutting and there's a lot of strategy and what you're going to cut and how you're going to cut. So, the first question is -- that to the far right, the total flow through, is that an outcome or is that a target? So, that's -- and as you answer the question, addressed that. And then where are we in terms of how deep will you cut? How much of a growth opportunity are you protecting on the other side of this? Maybe we can start there. Andy Silvernail : Yeah, you bet. You bet. So, if you -- the way to think about this is from a playbook perspective, as you recall, we go into any given year with really a battle plan of what you do on the downside, right? So, you're building a contingency plan. And we executed on that. We viewed 2020 as having a relatively high likelihood for a mild recession, right? That's where we were in the fourth quarter of last year. And so we took $15 million to $20 million of actions. And you can see that sitting in that next line over FY 2019 cost actions, that's the $5 million that we got in the quarter around that. And then as you start moving over, we laid out for people a plan or scenario as things got really ugly at the end of last quarter, we laid that out saying, Hey, your business went down as much as 35%, there was $120 million of costs, that we could go after, call it discretionary or variable cost that we could go after, which obviously was very aggressive. And unfortunately got misinterpreted if we were going to execute that. And we had to clarify that with some people. And then another $40 million of call it breaks the glass, right? And so, as you start to move over to the right, we did execute about half of that discretionary. So, that's the $15 million that you got in the quarter. And then you keep moving over to the right end. We obviously -- a good mix of price productivity and acquisitions. And then we also decided, Deane, that we have number of businesses that we think are going to be challenged for considerably -- structurally the business is now different. And we did some incremental restructuring in the quarter. What I would tell you right now is there's a little bit left to do in the third quarter, based on where we are today. It's not a time, it's a little bit. And then assuming that the bottom doesn't fall out. We're in a very good spot right now. We don't have more to do, but we can, right? We've got -- we still got another half of that discretionary that we talked about, that's available. And that $40 million of break the glass, so to speak, we are doing a little bit of that in some businesses, but that is not ubiquitous across the IDEX. Deane Dray : That's real helpful. And if I can switch gears and go back to the side on the microfluidics. For a second there, I thought I was in a Danaher conference call. So just a couple of questions. Andy Silvernail : A lot of the same markets. Deane Dray : Yes, sir. A couple of questions here on the application. And then, broadly, are you seeing investments yet on this whole wave of the reassuring of the U.S. pharmaceutical production capacity? So, two questions. One, for this application on page eight, are you both in vaccine discovery and also vaccine production and then all the farmer reassuring? Are you seeing any of that? Andy Silvernail : Yeah. So the answer to your first question is yes and yes. Or A question and question B, it's yes and yes. Deane Dray : So production and discovery \u2026 Andy Silvernail : And production. Deane Dray : \u2026 of the vaccine, and then eventually production, it gets used in both. Andy Silvernail : Well, so on the discovery piece of this, it's more in our life science business where we're playing in analytical instrumentation and biotech via sequencing. And if you -- this example here with a Microfluidizer, it is -- this is not new technology, so to speak being it's just now being brought to a scale that we've never seen before. And we're in a very unique position to be able to scale up a market leading technology and what is going to be an unbelievable boom in this business, right, around that. Because we're going to see lots of vaccines produced that actually never get used because all of the money that's flowing through that system. And so we are -- we've been a market leader here and will continue to be going forward.  Deane, I'm sorry. Can you repeat the second question? Deane Dray : Pharmaceutical reassuring? Andy Silvernail : Yeah. Yes. There is -- that is definitely happening to a degree. I think it's going to be slower than a lot of people think. It's not easy just to pick everything up. But we absolutely will play as that trend continues. And there will be certainly along some of the more sensitive areas. There's no doubt that that's happening. And we will benefit from that particularly in AI and our -- in our material process business, it will play a big role in that. And then to some degree in our analytical instrumentation and life sciences business. Deane Dray : That's real helpful. Thank you. Andy Silvernail : Thanks Deane. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question. Matt Summerville : Thanks. This is just more of a geographic question. Can you give a little bit of color in the quarter around the 17% organic, what you experienced in North America versus Europe versus China? And then similarly, maybe at least, some qualification around directionally how's things progressed in the geographies as things shutdown and opened up during the quarter. Just maybe more color around order rates there in as well, if you could. Andy Silvernail : Yeah, sure. So, if you look at the geographic breakdown, the U.S. was a little bit worse. Europe was kind of right on, and an Asia was better. China was actually positive for the quarter, which was a good sign, but we really got hammered in India because it fundamentally just went to zero, right? I mean, there was some sales, but there was such a massive shutdown in India. And those are really the big markets that matter for us. In terms of how things flowed that -- those numbers that Bill gave you around the months that was pretty consistent around the world with what I would say is Asia getting better or China rather than getting better, faster. So that was kind of one anomaly relative to the other data. But then everything really has followed the reopening. So, as you've seen reopening, you've seen improvement as you've seen shutdowns. You've seen business follow suit very, very closely, so that that's kind of the best forward run to what's going to happen to a business is what's happening relative to -- business getting back to business or things being aggressively shutdown. Matt Summerville : You mentioned on the microfluidics type of opportunity, but it also sounds like you're stepping up growth investments elsewhere. Can you maybe frame some of those up? And are there -- is there any way to sort of size up the magnitude of potential opportunity here with what you're seeing? Andy Silvernail : Yeah. So, we've got some things that I'm going to call, they're not particularly high beta and we know how to do them today, meaning there's an application and we know how to do it. So, I'll give you an example in spraying technologies and compressors or in the continued global ventilator build-up, our gas business is playing in there. Those are pieces of business that are that are kind of happening today. And are -- you can see the path going forward. They may come down, but you know how to do it and the businesses is there. And those are the things that are in the -- those are over $10 million total that you're seeing, right? So, those are the kind of -- that's the kind of size we're talking about. These are big overall programs that are hitting and are very attractive. Then you've got some things, Matt, that are a lot more -- that a much higher beta. So, we are doing a bunch of work on some revolutionary testing protocols where we have some really interesting technology and a lot of money is flowing from the outside towards these things. And what I would say is they're either going to be very big, we're talking tens of millions or the technologies don't work and they don't turn into anything. So, there's just a -- there's a lot more volatility around new technologies that we're playing in kind of where the end market goes, how quickly does global testing capability ramp up? Because when you think about testing capability, it's not just COVID testing that we're talking about. There's a -- our thesis and I believe this is correct, as you're going to see a reset of global testing capacity, because you're going to -- no one wants to get caught with this again. And so, I think you're going to see a multiyear build-up of testing capacity. So, two very different types of things, but you're talking in the tens of millions depending upon the success in the commercial markets. Matt Summerville : Great. Thanks, Andy. Andy Silvernail : Thanks Matt. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Allison Poliniak : Hi, guys. Good morning. Andy Silvernail : Good morning. Allison Poliniak : Just want to build on Deane's question around that the playbook that you talked about. Obviously, the portfolio was quite stressed in the quarter, but as we moved to that playbook, did anything come to light in terms of a process, a business, or even a regional exposure that you're kind of questioning now that you might kind of go back and have to revisit once things stabilize here? Andy Silvernail : Do you mean a -- first, a business that became vulnerable or something like that? Is that what you mean, Allison? Allison Poliniak : Vulnerable or sort of the way you're doing business today that maybe you have to kind of rethink some of that process? Anything that came to light that was pretty unique as you kind of moved through the stress that we had this quarter. It might be an early question here because we're still going through it. Andy Silvernail : Yeah. So, I think a couple of things that regard, Allison. The first thing I'd say is I'm going to make a general statement, so not around any specific business, is our ability to work at a distance that we've just all proven that out, right? And I don't like the concept of everyone thinking that we should all work remotely from now. And I think that's a horrible idea. But the ability to intimately work with customers and suppliers at a distance with -- I would say, equal or better outcomes, is I think is going to change a lot of things. I think our ability to understand our customer better and at a more frequent clip, with the comfort level that everyone has now built with technology, I think that's actually a really big deal. And it's important for our business like ours, that so application centric, so the ability to understand the problem, the ability to serve, the ability to problem fix in vitro, I think that's actually pretty important. So, that's a big one. Second, I would say is, the blessing in the curse at times of an IDEX, right, are these very, very high contribution margins. And we love them and we don't want to -- we obviously don't want to give them up. But I think our ability to make some things more variable is important, Right? And so, I think in some of our businesses where the fixed cost is wonderful when you're ramping boy, when it turns the other way it can get painful. So, you've got a few businesses out there that I think over time, we're going to do -- want to do more work on can you make things more variable? Then I guess, I think maybe the last thing I'd say is, is I think everyone has been surprised or at least we have been surprised at what you think is fixed and what you think is variable. It's a lot more flexible than maybe people had their head around. And if you just told me a year ago that we could do what we've done with our cost structure, I'm not sure I would have believed it Allison, to be candid with you. And I think we've demonstrated to ourselves our ability to do that. And I think going forward, how do you keep those lessons learned, and make sure that we have as dynamic a P&L and balance sheet as we can both on the upside and the downside. Allison Poliniak : Great. Great color. Thanks. And then, I guess, just a question on the municipal facing markets. Obviously, you said you saw some pressure with rescue and fire, water was holding and better. Have you -- with talking to those customers, is there a concern that as we head into 2021 that there could be incremental pressure on those? Obviously, we're seeing the news every day about various cities and municipalities becoming under financial strain, how are you viewing that market -- those markets? And is this something that you would anticipate some level of government funding coming in at some point? Andy Silvernail : Yeah. So, I think -- look, if you went back and looked at the financial crisis from 12 years ago, the municipal businesses held up well, and then 18 months or so later you saw the suffering. And I think -- I don't think it's going to take 18 months this time because I think everybody has learned how to react more quickly. And I do expect there to be a whole around municipal budgets, globally. And then I think what will happen is you are likely to get a -- some kind of step in, in terms of federal funding again -- or sovereign funding from governments because some of the stuff that's being delayed right now, because they're moving people and money to COVID related things, it's going to create actually a demand hole going into -- excuse me -- it's going to create a hole that you're going to have to fill with demand next year. And so, there's a little bit of compound and it's going to happen here. So, I do think that it will be -- I do think you'll see a hole here over the next 12 to 24 months. I think it's likely that you'll have some level of federal funding that will step in. But I think either way there will be a negative comp as you think about the next year or two. Allison Poliniak : Great. Thanks. That's helpful. Thank you. Andy Silvernail : Thanks, Allison. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Nathan Jones from Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Nathan Jones : Good morning, everyone. Andy Silvernail : Hi, Nathan. Nathan Jones : I'd like to go back to slide 12 as well. And I'm going to ask you a few questions about what that might look like when we change it to Q3. Your FY 2019 cost actions should still have five on that bar. Andy Silvernail : Yeah. Nathan Jones : You said you have got about half of the discretionary costs out. So, if you got this discretionary cost bar be 30 in Q3, or should it be some number between 15 and 30? Andy Silvernail : No. I'm sorry, Nathan, if there's any confusion on that. The 30 is what would have happened if we had seen our business go down by 35%, right? So, in the quarter, our business was down about 17% organically. And so that -- so we went after about half of that discretionary. So just to make sure everyone on the phone understands exactly what we're talking about. If you went back to our presentation in the -- after the first quarter, the $120 million that we outlined was a cost that we could potentially take out based on 35% volume decrease, we've had about half of that. So, it got to about half of the discretionary. That's what that 15 is. So, if you think about the third quarter, I would expect something around the 15, but again, volume dependent. So, if we do -- if we end up kind of closer to the 12, maybe that number is a little bit lower, but I think the 15 is probably a good number. Bill, would you concur with that? Bill Grogan : Yeah. I agree. It will be pretty close to 15 next quarter, plus or minus. Andy Silvernail : Yeah. Nathan Jones : Got it. And then, the price productivity and make should be roughly the same. Maybe it's a little lower. I mean, I know you've talked about maybe less than a point of price this year, so maybe that's four or five, something like that. And then we have other 2.5 from the structural cost actions that you've taken in 2Q. Bill Grogan : Correct. Andy Silvernail : Yeah. Nathan Jones : Okay. So, your organic flow through numbers probably going to be something like -- maybe a 35 or something like that by the time we get to the end of Q3? Bill Grogan : That was in that ballpark. Andy Silvernail : Yeah. I think, that\u2019s -- yes, in the ballpark. Nathan Jones : Okay. Then the next question I wanted to ask is on this overall like 12 to 17 organic guide. Clearly, you had the lowest order number in May. You turn your inventory about every six weeks. So, you should have basically worked through that already. If not -- in the early part of July you go to 3.8 year comp year-over-year, we've talked about things getting sequentially a little bit better. Maybe you can talk about what would have to happen to be at the low end at that 17, that would seem to be -- you'd have to say some kind of disruption in supply chains or shutdowns or something like that to be at minus 17. And maybe what you would need to say in order to get better than that minus 12. Because it looks to me at the moment, like you should be trending at least towards the better end of that range rather than the worst end. Andy Silvernail : Yeah. The answer to this question is really straightforward, Nathan. I think to be at the bottom end of that means that the negative 17, it would have to -- they have to look like this past quarter effectively, right, in terms of how that bumped along. And to be better than the 12, which obviously I don't see right now because we just -- there's no evidence to that. And we did take down backlog in the quarter. I think you'd have to see more sequential improvement. That's why that 12 to 17 feels -- really feels right. But I can see a scenario -- there's a potential scenario with that gets a little bit better. And less the scenario where it gets worse and it's worse than the 17 is we get a massive shutdown. And one of the things to keep in mind here also is you're seeing a surge in cases in the U.S. Obviously, Europe has done significantly better at managing this than the U.S. has. So, there's a lot of uncertainty there. And then, frankly, this presidential election is just starting to kick off. And I think it's -- it brings an awful lot of uncertainty into the world. And so, this is probably going to be the nastiest presidential election in that we've seen in our modern history. And it's going to cause an awful lot of volatility that I'm concerned about that. So, those are two things that could make it worse. But I don't see that at this point. I don't see it worse than the 17. Nathan Jones : I know you guys plan for the worst and hope for the best. One last one. Would you expect to burn backlog during the third quarter, or relatively stable? Andy Silvernail : Bill, what do you think there? Bill Grogan : Yeah, relatively stable. Nathan Jones : Okay. Thanks very much for your time. Andy Silvernail : Thanks, Nathan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Scott Graham with Rosenblatt Securities. Please proceed with your question. Scott Graham : Can you hear me? Andy Silvernail : Sure, can Scott. Good morning. Scott Graham : Hey, good morning. I have several questions around the guidance as well. First of all, maybe go back to the second quarter guidance, which was minus 15 to 25. And you did a minus 17, so you sort of came on the better end of that. What surprised you versus the midpoint in the quarter? Andy Silvernail : Yeah. So, you remember when we gave that guidance, the world was just starting to unwind. And frankly, it was very hard to understand what that downside could be. We felt like we could very easily understand what it took to get to 15. We felt like it was very hard to understand what was coming relative to the low end of those expectations. So, it was -- we were definitely in a world 90 days ago that our ability to call the top line was significantly worse than our ability right now. There's still volatility in our businesses, but you are seeing -- if you look across our key industrial businesses, you are seeing the flattening of the order rates, which is a great sign. As you know, we keep a very close watch on our short cycle businesses. They tend to tell us a lot. The volatility that existed 90 days ago has definitely come down substantially in day rates.  And so, we feel a lot better around calling this range. So, we had a 10 point range at the end of last quarter, and we've now shrunk that down to a five point range. And typically, right, we're a two point range, one to two. And so, I think our ability to call things is getting much better and assuming that this trend continues and we don't get a massive disruption, I think you'll see us be able to keep tightening that range as we get 90 days from now. Scott Graham : Okay. Bill Grogan : The only thing I'd add to that, I think there was a -- there's the commercial variability, but then there was the unknown operational uptime and supply chain uptime where I think we got more comfortable with those two aspects that helped us narrow the range. And the things that Andy identified as potential risks within the quarter, kind of give us the range that we have now. Andy Silvernail : Right Scott Graham : No. I get that, I guess. And in Andy's answer, it sounds to me like the third quarter guidance you feel better about -- sort of it's a little bit more scientific than the second quarter guidance. I guess, to that same end, I would maybe wonder why -- if you're thinking the things improving sequentially, it just seems like if you just did a minus 17 and what I think most of us thought was going to be the worst quarter in the history of history. Things bottomed out in May. I guess, I'm still -- I'm still not quite sure how -- there's even a 17 organic in that guidance. I mean, what's your caution here on that number? Andy Silvernail : Well, look, here a couple of things. We have a one and a half data points, meaning we have the month of June and we have part of July for things sequentially getting better. And I think that if what we're seeing right now holds that negative 12 feels right, right? So -- and that would be sequentially better. If -- the downside, the 17 is -- if you see some kind of significant issue around, again, the surge that we're seeing in the United States, just remember the actual numbers are worse today than they were when we were all panicked, right? The actual data is worse and -- in the United States in particular. And we're now just starting to see the effects in the emerging world. So the 17 is basically saying that things backslide substantially and they -- and they look like they actually did in the second quarter. Now, remember when we were sitting here at 90 days ago, none of us had any idea what the real downside scenario was. And I do feel like we've been able to bracket that and understand that in a much better way, Scott, that gives me confidence in that 12 to 17. I have a lot more confidence in the 12 to 17 than I did in the 15 to 25. A lot more confidence. Scott Graham : Yes. It sounds like that. And so just two other quick follow-ups. Number one, let's just look at the minus 12 or let's us look at the midpoint of the 3Q guidance. Which of the markets, the end markets on that really cool page with the -- I think it's on page 12. Yeah. No, not page 12, nine. Which of the markets there -- which of the markets or the swing factors that gets you better? Could you tell us that? Andy Silvernail : You're talking about the checkerboard slide, Scott? Scott Graham : Yeah. Andy Silvernail : Yeah. So I think -- look, the things that have the most volatility and then right now are in FMT and diversified. And so the -- if you look at where the negative volatility has been, it's really been dominated around general industrial and then things that are touching transportation effectively, right, and oil and gas obviously, we -- that's kind of a different animal exacerbated by all of this. I think that the general industrial bottoming and starting to improve is what would drive a better outcome. And I would also say that is the most vulnerable to a second downtick. So, there's going to be the most volatility around industrial, chemical. Those two stand out to me.  And then I'd put dispensing, if you go over to Fire & Safety, dispensing and automotive, and dispensing is a little bit different animal, because there's actually something interesting happening there, which is on the consumer side of dispensing that business is actually booming, meaning that if you look at the big box retailers and the folks who are selling paint, that business is actually booming, but they're just not buying, because they're pushing up their capital spend. Where I would say on the industrial side, it's actually -- it's more correlated with what's actually happening in the markets. But you could definitely see a meaningful uptick in dispensing if people get more confidence. And then certainly around transportation, auto is starting to come back, which is a great sign. Clearly, aerospace is a different issue in our BAND-IT business, which is great mix for us, has had some negatives relative to transportation, specifically aerospace. Scott Graham : That's hugely helpful. Would you mind if I just snuck one more question here for Bill? So, I guess, I was a little bit curious about the break the glass, $40 million potential. I'm assuming that that's a structural cost reduction number for potential. And I'm wondering why it's not a larger number than that. Bill Grogan : Well, I mean, it's compounding on $20 million of actions we took in Q4. So, if you look at that total bucket, that'd be $60 million. Scott Graham : 40 is potential, I thought you said. I'm just trying to understand like it, if that structural -- and if it's not, please tell me -- if that's structural, it would seem like there is -- would be -- what does that number exactly break the glass? Andy Silvernail : You're taking out is the fundamental fixed cost of the business, which is facilities and people, right? That is a -- that's a really big number. And just to give you a sense of it, right, when we laid out the $15 million to $20 million last year, that was a sizeable number and meaningful, but again, kind of structured around a -- what we thought might be a mild recession. But to give you some sense of it in 2008, 2009, Bill, I can't remember -- I want to say we took out $40 million total during that\u2026 Bill Grogan : A little bit less, but around there. Andy Silvernail : And that was total, Scott, including discretionary, right? And right now, we are at a total run rate. Bill, is at $90 million. Is that the number? Bill Grogan : Yeah. If you add in the discretionary, correct. Andy Silvernail : Yeah. Bill Grogan : Yeah. I mean, again, the discretionary will ramp down as sales improve. So that would assume kind of the current run rate revenue decline. Andy Silvernail : Yeah. So we have been hugely aggressive around cost out. Scott Graham : Well, frame that way. I understand it better. Thanks a lot, guys. Andy Silvernail : Yeah. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from line of Joe Giordano with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, good morning. This is Robert in for Joe. Andy Silvernail : Hi, Robert. Unidentified Analyst : Just wanted to turn back -- hey, good morning. Just wanted to turn back to M&A, real quick. I know this is kind of a very strange downturn that we're seeing right here with economics of companies that might've gone down dramatically, but the price of the businesses that they're trying to sell have not. So, just wondering what you're seeing in terms of valuation and how people are thinking about like selling their companies and what price days, or just kind of how you're thinking about that situation? Andy Silvernail : Yeah. If you just kind of look at the general math, what I would say is that the -- when you balance off the cash earnings decline that we're seeing in target relative to the drop in interest rates, when you actually kind of do the math on valuations, it actually neutralizes pretty close, Robert, with some gap to an increase in an aggregate valuation on a cash flow basis, a little bit. But they do offset pretty closely. So, look, people have not changed their expectations on valuation that has definitely not happened. The down stroke was too brief. The public markets came back so aggressively that private sellers -- they tend to build their expectations off of public markets. And so, at least anyone who's sophisticated. And so, look, the valuation expectations have stayed elevated. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. That\u2019s great. Thanks very much. I'll pass it along. Andy Silvernail : Thanks, Robert. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Silvernail now for any final comments. Andy Silvernail : Thank you very much. Well, thank you everybody for your time here and your patients and understanding what's happening in the world. Obviously, we're all experiencing this together. And two things that I asked you to kind of take away. Number one, the mission of this company and the values of this company have been tested. And I think everybody has been tested. And I am just incredibly proud of how all the people across IDEX have responded to this. They have responded with compassion. They have responded with action. They have responded with discipline and prudence. And it's just -- it really warms your heart as a leader to see those values, not only stick, but deepen in a moment like this. Second, back -- over the last few years, I've talked about what happens to a company like ours in difficult times. And one of the things that I have been very proud about is that our ability to maintain cash earnings in difficult times. I have always claimed that that's something that we could do certainly over a shorter period, say a given year. And I think what you see here in the second quarter is exactly that, right? We had an incredible cash flow performance. And if you think of it as from a cash, EPS standpoint, that's really impressive. And as we go through the rest of the year, obviously, we won't have the same opportunity with AR that we had here in the last quarter, but we will with inventory. And I expect us when we look back on this year, obviously, we'll all think about this and the difficulty that we had. But I think it will show once again, the durability of a company like IDEX and the business model that this company has. And I think it\u2019s really something else. And I'm really -- it's a pleasure for me to have the ability to lead this business. So, with that, I'll thank you all for attending and look forward to talking to you all here over the next 90 days. Take care. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to your host, Mike Yates. Thank you. You may begin. Mike Yates : Great. Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. This is Mike Yates, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for IDEX Corporation. Let me start by saying thank you for joining our discussion of the IDEX third quarter 2020 financial highlights. Last night, we issued a press release outlining our Company's financial and operating performance for the three months ending September 30, 2020. The press release, along with the presentation slides to be used during today's webcast can be accessed on our Company's website at www.idexcorp.com. Joining me today is Andy Silvernail and Bill Grogan, additionally, Eric Ashleman, our President and recently announced CEO of IDEX, will be joining us as well. Andy Silvernail : Thanks Mike. Good morning, everyone. Before we dive into our third quarter results, I'd like to take a moment and talk about the leadership transition we announced yesterday. After 12 wonderful years at IDEX and nearly a decade as Chief Executive Officer, I'm stepping down as Chairman and CEO in mid-December. I'm delighted that the Board of Directors has selected our President and COO, Eric Ashleman as IDEX's new CEO, effective December 15, 2020. Eric is a uniquely capable leader, who has a clear choice for the role. He and I have worked closely together since I joined IDEX. We work side-by-side to establish our strategy, build our culture and deliver value for all of our stakeholders. Eric brings extensive knowledge of our business, deep insights into our markets and a passion for bringing up the best of our people. My decision comes after deep reflection. Leaving IDEX has been the greatest prier to my career. It's a significantly different Company today than when I joined in 2009. We've accelerated our transformation from an acquisition-based holding Company, into a high-performing global enterprise that improves lives on a daily basis. With this strong foundation, IDEX is positioned for continued growth and value creation. So it's a good time for change for two reasons. First, IDEX is ready. We've let a remarkable Company through this pandemic crisis, our mission has never mattered more, our culture and financial position has never been stronger and our team has never been more capable. To that end, we're fortunate to have Eric, as the next IDEX CEO. He's a proven leader who has delivered excellence for our shareholders and our broad stakeholders for the past 13 years. Second, I'm ready. For the last couple of years, many of you have asked me about my career thoughts. I've always said that I love IDEX, but I thought 10 years is about the right shelf life for a public company CEO. I could never have dreamed what we were accomplished over the span. We've built an organization that advances and save lives of millions of people around the globe. We have created a highly engaged organization that is among the best in the world. We've impacted our communities through compassion and generosity with the support of the IDEX foundation. And we have delivered for our owners, producing total shareholder return of greater than 530%. For me personally, I'm excited for a new phase of life that brings along new challenges and opportunities for me and my family. I'm going to become Chairman, CEO, and an owner of Madison Industries, one of the world's largest private companies. This new opportunity offers a chance to build another great organization and make positive change in the world over a very long horizon. I am confident now is the right time to pass the torch and welcome IDEX's next generation of leadership. On a personal note, Eric has been a true partner and a dear friend to me. And, I'm confident that this transition to CEO will be seamless for our Company, employees and all of our stakeholders. As this is my last earnings call, I want to say how grateful I am to have worked alongside our incredibly talented team, the last 12 years. It has been an honor to serve as Chairman and CEO, and to be part of a Company like IDEX. I also want to thank all of our investors and analysts on the phone, who are with us today for the support through the years. The future of IDEX is very bright. We have reached new levels of industry leadership and sustained value creation and we will do so again under, Eric as our CEO. As Mike, mentioned, Eric is joining Bill and I for the earnings call. Bill and I will walk through our assessment and analysis and view of the future as we normally do. We'll then turn to Q&A and Eric will join the conversation and talk about the future. I'll now turn to our results for the third quarter. We continue to see a strong sequential rebound in orders, with September 2020, topping the same month last year. That's a good sign. I want to thank all of our people around the globe, who've risen to the occasion. And a year no one could have predicted, our people continued to shine. So to all of the IDEX team members listening on this call, thank you. A time like this truly tests the culture of the Company. Are you rooted in strong values that people really live and believe? If so, you will be better prepared to survive and even thrive. IDEX is this kind of company and it's serving us well. Because of the protocols we've put in place, the disruptions we've seen in our operations have been limited. We have protected our people within the workplace and we will do so even if the COVID trends are moving in the wrong way. We continue to focus on solving our customers' greatest challenges, many of which have shifted this year. That has reinforced the need to stay close to our customers even when we have to remain socially distanced to understand their needs. Bill will walk through the details shortly, but as you've seen, our organic sales are down 12% year-over-year falling at the better end of our predicted range. Importantly, organic orders were down only 5% and continued to improve sequentially, a trend that is continuing in October. Been a diversified company helps a great deal in times like these, while certain sectors like energy continue to struggle, other aspects of the economy are booming. This diversity gives us strength, limiting our exposure to any one sector. The financial controls we put in place early continue to serve us well. We are delivering strong profitability and exceptional cash flow as we have pivot to growth, we have ramped up our capital spending and investment to support some really exciting initiatives. We've also seen activity in the M&A market start to pick up. While those pillars of safety, business continuity and liquidity, are also part of our pandemic operating focus, it is time to aggressively play offense. I'm turning to Slide 7. That increased focus on playing offense has us involved in some exciting new opportunities. A variety of our businesses are producing new solutions for cleaning and disinfecting public spaces. One shine example is a sprayer, that uses electrostatically charged particles to envelope a surface, not just hit the side base in sprayer. We anticipate solutions like this will continue to be in demand, not just during this pandemic but for years to come as public demand for cleaning and disinfection will be forever changed by this period of time. We also have an exciting new opportunity to partner with customers to develop a highly accurate point of care solution for diagnostic testing for COVID-19. Our IDEX Health & Science team is hard at work ramping up. With public health experts increasingly predicting that the coronavirus will be like influenza, remain in circulation even after vaccines are widely available, we anticipate this will be a significant new program for our Company for the foreseeable future. I'll share more about that in a moment. We also continue to see machines used in production of pharmaceuticals and vaccines. Insourcing critical API manufacturing is a key initiative for several countries, and last quarter, we shared our microfluidizer processors are key technology for manufacturing vaccine adjuvants. Vaccine adjuvants are immune stimulators added to many vaccines commonly used today. By using the adjuvant in a vaccine, the body can often produce a better immune response to the antigen, while also allowing vaccine manufacturers to be able to produce more doses of vaccine with less antigen. Our team was excited to recently deliver machines for use in producing advanced supplies of one of the leading vaccines in testing today. We are also working actively with other vaccine manufacturers as the world prepares for an unprecedented race for production and distribution of this critical piece of the puzzle for solving the COVID-19 crisis. I'm moving to Slide 8. In Health & Science, our products are being used to help and enable rapid highly accurate testing of COVID-19. Our things microfluidic cartridges are a key technology used to diagnose COVID-19 infection in the point of care molecular market, which allows testing to be done near the patient versus being sent to a laboratory. Our technology-enabled demilitarization of complex laboratory workflows, by integrating pumps, valves, sample, reagent management and signal detection, in order to provide a simple workflow for the operator of the instrument. This instrument operator only needs to add the patient sample to the cartridge, insert it in the instrument and then push a button to run the test. Our microfluidics capabilities allow for high volume production and consistent repeatable results that are needed to combat COVID-19. In addition, H&S has optical filters and several diagnostic instruments that are used for COVID-19 testing. We provide various footer components designed in, in vitro diagnostic instruments used for COVID-19. We have the gassers, pumps, manifolds and fluidic connections in these IVD instruments that typically analyze blood samples. We also have both optics and fluidics assemblies and next-generation DNA sequencers being used to analyze COVID-19 to better understand the virus and track it spread. I'm proud of how our businesses have answered the call over the past two quarters and work closely with our customers to innovate and deliver critical solutions to the marketplace. Alright, I'm moving to Slide 9. We provide an update on the state of our primary end markets. We saw sequential improvement in most of our end markets with some of our more challenged markets including auto and dispensing recovering faster than we anticipated. In fluid metering, the broader industrial softness and the volatility in oil and gas has continued though we did see a pickup in daily order rates in the month of September, which provides optimism as we close out the year and we head into 2021. Significant capital investment by our customers continues to be on hold and in a broader market recovery and reduction in global economic uncertainty. Our water business has continued to show resiliency impacted only by timing delays in some municipal projects. As we called out last quarter, agriculture has performed well, it's growing optimism and investment held up in the quarter. In Health & Science, semicon has continued to outpace our expectations and was strong sequentially and year-over-year. Our sealing business recovered nicely in the quarter through the resumption of activity in the auto market. Additionally, the product innovations, I discussed earlier helped generate positive momentum for us in multiple end markets including industrial. On the other side, analytical instrumentation and some aspects of VD/BIO, we continue to see that as medical industry is focused on COVID-19, other investments in lab equipment were delayed and we've not yet seen the activity materially pickup. Moving to Fire & Safety and Diversified. We saw sequential improvement in most of our markets. Recovery in auto and retail are big stories driving a rebound in our BAND-IT and Dispensing businesses. Fire rescue continued to see strong performance, but we have been impacted by production delays at OEMs pushing projects out and extending lead times for municipal deliveries. Backlog in these businesses continue to be strong and we're working closely with our customers to monitor delivery schedules and assess the impact of COVID-19 on future year municipal budgets. Previously funded projects continue to go and demand for our new products in these businesses has been strong. We are overall optimistic about the market recovery we've seen in the third quarter and continue to believe that the diversified nature of our businesses has helped mitigate the impact of the global economic decline. Our dedication to our customers and ability to respond and innovate quickly has continued to generate momentum for us to combat market declines. As we head into the fourth quarter, we expect to see a pickup in order rates, particularly in our day rate businesses, as an indicator of further recovery. Okay. I'm moving to Slide 10. I want to provide some additional context to the organic order trends we've seen over the past two quarters. We saw a broad rebound in order rates in the third quarter, recovering from organic declines and as much as 23% in the second quarter. To organic growth in the month of September, all of our segments participated in this trend. FMT organic orders improved each month, driven by strength to agriculture and stabilization and industrial, as well as a slight pickup in energy. HST was driven by a recovery in the auto market and targeted new product initiatives, as well as the positive momentum in semicon and pharma that I mentioned earlier. Finally, Diversified's organic orders saw dramatic improvements at BAND-IT and Dispensing, as auto and aerospace businesses open back up and capital spending returned in the paint markets. On top of the year-over-year improvements, we also experienced sequential increases with FMT up 12% HST, up 6% and FSD up 11% versus the second quarter. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results for the quarter. Bill Grogan : Thanks Andy. I'll start with our consolidated financial results on Slide 12. Q3 orders of $570 million were down 3% overall and 5% organically. As Andy just mentioned, we saw a broad bounce back in order rates across our businesses and monthly sequential improvement in organic order rates throughout the quarter. Third quarter sales of $581 million were down 7% overall and down 12% organically. Industrial energy markets remain challenged in the quarter and one of the main contributors of the organic declines. As mentioned before, we saw recovery in the auto and dispensing markets as well as continued strength in semi and pharma to help to offset those headwinds, coupled with the benefit of new applications and innovations we have made in response to COVID-19. We're able to drive organic sales to the top end of our previous estimates. Q3 adjusted gross margin declined 190 basis points to 43.3%, primarily driven by lower volume, the dilutive impact of acquisitions and business mix, partially offset by price and the continued impact of cost control actions we have taken. Gross margin was up 70 basis points sequentially versus the second quarter. Third quarter adjusted operating margin was 23.1%, down 210 basis points from the prior year mainly driven by lower volume leverage and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by the restructuring actions and discretionary cost controls. We also saw sequential improvement in op margin increasing 200 basis points from Q2. Our Q3 effective tax rate was 14.4%, which was lower than the 18.6% in the prior year due to discrete benefits associated with the recent changes to the global intangible low tax income regulations. This was a multi-year true-up going back to the start of tax reform and we only have a minor benefit on a rate going forward. Third quarter adjusted net income was $106 million resulting in an adjusted EPS of $1.40 down $0.12 or 8% compared to prior-year EPS. When compared to our second quarter year-to-date tax rate, the reduced ETR increased adjusted EPS by approximately $0.11 in the quarter. Finally, free cash flow was $135 million for the quarter, down 7% compared to the prior year and was 128% of net income, a conversion rate higher than last year. The strong performance was a result of a significant focus and discipline on working capital management. The teams continue to drive our DSO lower and improve our past due rate as well as increase our inventory turns. We continue to demonstrate our ability to drive cash flow conversion in excess of net income. Moving on to Slide 13. As we discussed in our previous earnings call, we continue to take the necessary steps to manage cost and mitigate the significant impact of reduced volume. Our adjusted operating income declined $23 million in the quarter, with organic sales down $75 million, we would have expected a negative impact on operating income of approximately $45 million at roughly 60% contribution margin. This $45 million was offset by $25 million of executed operational initiatives, $7 million from the impact of restructuring actions taken in Q4 of last year and the second quarter of this year, $13 million of discretionary cost control items and $5 million of price and net productivity that was partially offset by $6 million of negative product and business mix primarily associated with FMT. The $13 million of discretionary cost actions in the quarter was lower compared to the $15 million we referenced last quarter, primarily due to modest increases in spend to support and service our customers, as well as some targeted investments we made in growth initiatives. Overall, our teams continue to do an exceptional job of managing costs to mitigate revenue declines. As Andy discussed earlier, we have ensured that we are well-positioned to pivot to offense and continue to invest in initiatives to generate growth in the fourth quarter and beyond. With that, I'd like to turn it back over to Andy, to summarize our Q4 expectations and provide some final thoughts. Andy Silvernail : Thank you, Bill. I'm on Slide 14 everyone. As I mentioned earlier, we are firmly what I call Phase 3, of the pandemic response, living with the virus. I'm proud of how our teams have adapted and innovated in this environment, our teams have embraced our mission and our values and have been diligent executing our COVID-19 playbook. We maintain optimism to the market recovery we've experienced will continue and we've seen the benefit of the proactive steps we took at the end of last year and throughout the early phases of pandemic, positioning IDEX to remain strong, while taking advantage of new opportunities. We expect revenue in the fourth quarter will be down between 3% and 5% organically based on our current backlog position and expected daily order rates. We are in close contact with our customer base and we continue to look for signs of confidence and capital spending, that will be the catalyst for sustained recovery. We continue to make strategic investments in our business, just for further long-term growth, we remain disciplined in our efforts to manage costs. To conclude, this quarter was a great display of the strength of the IDEX business model. From the resiliency of our base business to our ability to respond to challenges quickly and deliver innovative solutions to our customers. I continue to remain optimistic about our prospects to come and think about coming out of this crisis even stronger than when we entered it with new opportunities for growth on the horizon. With that let me pause and turn it over to the operator for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Deane Dray : First question would be for Eric, and look no one should be surprised that you were picked to take the helm based upon your role as COO for a number of years and most recently as President. So you've had the opportunity to be part of the leadership team for a number of years, but you've also had the opportunity to make your own assessment about the opportunities at IDEX. So I'd be really interested in hearing just at the outset? What kinds of changes might you be considering or just at least the areas of focus that you think you would be taking initially? And I'd be remiss if I didn't ask about your commitment to the 80-20 business system? Thank you. Eric Ashleman : Sure, sure thank you, Deane. It's great to talk with you and great to talk with everybody here. I'm excited to get going. Look I think as we think about focus and priorities, I want to make sure that we all appreciate that this is a story of continuity alongside purposeful evolution. So I have worked for Andy for 12 years, every day he has been part of IDEX. I guess since I'm reported to him. Andy Silvernail : Yes. Eric Ashleman : And for the last five years, I've served as the COO of the company. And so side-by-side, I mean we have been - partners in all the major decisions that we've made along the way that have evolved the company to where we are today and that certainly includes 80-20. I mean that is at the cornerstone of what we call the IDEX difference. And so, maybe less appreciated is the evolution - the organizational evolution that's happened alongside all of that. So in these five years, I mean, we've been very, very deliberate to work on developing other voices that are now part of the senior team and have been. Frankly, our group executives joined our senior team over a year ago. I look down the table here at Bill. Bill was my original operating partner in finance. So this is a team effort, it has been a team effort. And so, the strategy that's in my head is the same one that we've been working on all these years. Now that being said look that the world is definitely in a dynamic spot now. There is a pandemic in front of us. There is things like digitalization that are happening all over the place. And we've got a thing or things like aggressive capital deployment and how we're going to work all of that in this environment. So those priorities were here before this day, they remain very firmly in front of me as we go forward. And I absolutely - I'm an advocate of 80-20. It's a way of thinking as much as it's a part of the operating model. Deane Dray : That's great to hear. And just second question would be more along the lines of the issues at hand. And I'm especially interested in getting some more color around these COVID business products and service opportunities. I know you've sized it at $25 million to $100 million, and maybe you can give us some additional color about the potential time to revenue and will this all be organic in terms of the investment, might there be any JVs acquisitions along the way, but if you can start with time to revenue? Thanks. Eric Ashleman : Yes, sure, sure. So look, there is multiple phases. I mean this is no doubt a dynamic world. I mean this - most of these applications didn't exist in our minds sooner than March of this year. So we have some elements and components that are - that they're moving now. They're part of the fight today. They are embedded in our sales numbers that you're looking at. I would say that the bulk of the opportunities and some of the things that we talked about here today. They're a little further out, they are compressed development cycles. They are very, very active now. And we would see a lot of them starting to get some initial market traction in early 2021, but some very, very important milestones along the way that we're working with different partners and customers to bring those to bear. They are organic in nature now, certainly as things continue to develop and evolve that inorganic opportunities to make them bigger and more impactful would be something we would absolutely consider. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Halloran with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Mike Halloran : Eric, congratulations very well deserved. Andy, it's been a good decade. I'll miss working with you. It's been a pleasure. Andy Silvernail : Thank you, Mike. Mike Halloran : You're going to do awesome at Madison obviously, but we'll miss you here. Eric will be a great replacement, but we'll definitely miss you. Andy Silvernail : Thanks. Mike Halloran : So thanks for everything, over the years. So with that first question, I know - the partial answer to this, but just want to confirm, with Eric you're taking over. I'm guessing the willingness desire and ability to push forward on the M&A strategy doesn't really change. So just confirm that and given the thoughts on how you're thinking about the funnel as we sit here today actionability and ability to convert? Eric Ashleman : Yes well, absolutely. The focus remains very, very high on that front. I mean ultimately IDEX was built that way through acquisition. So, I think as the pandemic unfolded obviously, things froze up in the early days. We've seen things free up now. The process as you might imagine is quite different. I mean we're - none of us are in airplanes. We're doing a lot of it remotely and virtually, but we've adopted just as we've adapted our businesses in that way. And I think as we look forward, this is an area of huge focus for our team, the group executive is one of the big reasons we brought them onto our senior team and so, frankly we could get more hands on the opportunity itself. And so, we're looking aggressively. I think, we're looking for properties that are - they've got to be good IDEX businesses, that's something that we're always going to keep firmly in our sites that you could imagine in times like this that. This is a complex operating environment and businesses that might not be able to handle it quite, as well, but are very, very differentiated would be something that we think we could bring a lot of value to. And so, we're considering that as an extension of sort of our normal course and the normal filters that we use as we think about businesses we'd like to own. But I can assure you it absolutely remains a fundamental piece of the day and a priority for us. Mike Halloran : And secondarily, good to see the sequential trends continuing to October here, maybe some initial thoughts on next year and how you're handicapping things internally. Obviously one of IDEX's mantras is to be able to adjust and adapt to whatever the environment looks like, but how are you thinking about linearity trends in the next year and any kind of thoughts along those lines at this point? Andy Silvernail : Yes Mike, maybe I'll just touch on it first and then let Eric go deeper on it. So really no real difference from how we thought about it last quarter. If you look at the sequential improvement that we've seen go back from second quarter - first quarter, third quarter - second quarter, third quarter and that's sequential gain and we're now in that 3% to 5% down. The last really tough comp will be Q1 of next year. And I think we'll know a lot more going into that quarter, but I will say going into the fourth quarter. We always look at the backlog load and that gives us a confidence level and we are at the higher end of our normal backlog load going into the quarter. That's a really good sign it gives a lot of work around that 3% to 5% organic. First quarter will be a tough comp and then, but if you keep thinking about the sequentials. And you think about that acceleration that puts us in a good spot for the entire year as you think about it. I know Eric, you put a lot of thought into this as we are prepping for our budgets and going through a strat plan. Eric Ashleman : Yes, yes. And absolutely, Mike you know as well. I mean, we stay agile and reactive along the way that always serves us well. So as we think about the variability that's still in front of us at least in the next quarter or two till we get a handle on where the pandemic is going to go. I mean we've set up an operating cadence that allows us to course-correct and adjusts really, really well. And so, I mean a good example of that you can see in our opening comments. I mean we've got - we've taken the structural actions where we need to really fast. In fact, we took some of them even before the pandemic first showed up in the early spring. And at the same time, we've been able to rally and pivot resources around the opportunities that we outlined as we talked about fighting the pandemic. That's the way we do business and it works equally well for things on the downside because of more variability or opportunities that are accelerated and in front of us even sooner. And so that's how we're going to run the company and follow that course. Operator : Our next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Allison Poliniak : Congrats Eric, and echo everybody's comments Andy it's hard to see you go, but best of luck there. Andy Silvernail : Thank you. Allison Poliniak : Just kind of reflecting back over your tenure, Andy, as you had this vision for IDEX when you first took the helm, how far off has it been veered off of that vision, obviously very successful still. And then also what surprised you over the years most with the enterprise as you went through that tenure? Andy Silvernail : Yes, I guess, Allison you're asking that question a good time, you can imagine I'm pretty reflective right now about everything we've done together. I think that the early kernels, I'll remember back and the folks from IDEX who are listening to this call, they'll remember. We had - our global leadership meeting in March of 2012. And when you look at what Eric, just referred to is what we internally call the IDEX difference which is around great teams 80-20, and obsessive focus on the customer. We started laying those kernels out then. And from there, they grew and what you found was that is that kernel grew and you dug in deeper. You saw that the levers that really matter are actually very few. When you get right down to it, the levers that matter are very few. And Eric and I have had about 10,000 conversations over the years in offices, in airplanes, in conference rooms at each other's houses, talking about how to make that real and talking about how do you get these big concepts that sound like frankly stupid corporate speak down to the people, who actually do the work. And that's where we've dug in really deep. And so, the levers that matter, the first thing is, do you have a mission that people care about, right, did the people actually care about the work that they're doing and how they're impacting the world. And when you get a compelling mission, it aligns everybody really quickly. Second is, do you have good businesses or bad businesses. I've been in good businesses and I've been bad businesses and Eric I know, I've been in some pretty bad ones too. And those are - those are instructive, right, because bad businesses you spend a lot of time on problems that you can absolutely frankly never fix. And so position yourself into good businesses and that means acquisition and it also means that approach to 80-20 all along because within any business, there are - there is a great business and there is bad business and you got to work through that on a constant basis. And you got to move resources, right. You got to move resources to the things that matter most, where profits really exist, where you have a differentiated position. The last - the next one is great teams. One of the interesting things about IDEX, we have 45 businesses, we have 45 corner offices, and we've seen time and again when you put a great leader in, it is like a light switch. It's not slow, it's fast, how - what they do with the business, and if you combine that great leader and leadership team with a great business, there is a magic that happens there that is just incredible. And then I'd say the last thing is process discipline. And if you think about this as an exponential equation, right, and you bring process discipline to bear for us that happens to be the elements of the IDEX difference, that really is the formula or the equation that Eric and I and the team have been putting together for years and years and years. Yes, Allison, in terms of some of the learnings, they all go into those buckets. If I could go back in time and pull and change a couple of things. Look, there have been times when I moved to slow with leaders who weren't getting it done and I've learned that you can't do that, right. People either buy-in or they don't. It's very hard to convince somebody that they should do something that they are opposed to out of the gates. And so you got to get people who are excited and you got to ride those horses. Asset choices, look, I really do believe that in this next phase of life and Eric is incredibly well-positioned to do this. Acquisitions are going to matter a lot and we've made some really good asset choices, we made a couple of bad ones. And again, kind of like choosing good and bad. When you choose bad, it hurts, and when you choose. Good. It's amazing what they do. And I'll just - I'll reference, one the first business we bought - that I bought is part of IDEX was PPE and that was in 2010, I wasn't CEO yet and it's a little business in England and what you saw there was for all the elements of what makes IDEX special, and we've gone from that little business in England to $300 million platform, that is just an incredible part of our business. That's the model that I think we need to follow here going forward. And so, Allison, I appreciate the question, it definitely is a reflective time. Allison Poliniak : Great, thanks for the perspective. And just turning to the comment around sort of living with the virus makes sense, is that reflected in sort of your current order trends that you're seeing from customers, we're just seeing Germany going back into a lockdown here, just trying to - I guess better understand how you're thinking about that potential volatility here with the resurgence happening at this point? Eric Ashleman : Well, I'll take that one, Allison. So look I think ever since the pandemic started here. I mean, we've seen that volatility enter our order book and we're always going to have two ways that we delineated, we've got kind of that every day replenishment cycle that happens in a lot of our component businesses. And then honestly, as long as the system is on states pretty constant. And so, irrespective of border closings and other things, it generally has held up pretty well, what tends to move on us is, are a little bit more project-intensive businesses, larger unit of - units of measure and they're very much affected by the view of the world around us. So I think as we see this, no doubt. I think this next wave will be different than the one we saw in March, because everybody kind of recognizes the economic consequence of that and everybody has done a better job of tooling the organizations up to be able to live with it and coexist with it. So we're expecting more volatility as the cases go up, but I don't see that it should knock us off the trend path that we're on, as we just continue to live with it. And that goes for IDEX that goes for any other business. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question. Matt Summerville : Yes, I echo everyone's comment and congrats to everyone. So a question on the COVID-19 opportunities you've identified, the 25 to 100. I assume that's kind of an ongoing run rate you're looking for I guess organically what sort of spend that is associated with going out to get that revenue and what sort of defines the high and low-end of that range? Andy Silvernail : So maybe I'll take a first shot at that. I would say, we've made some initial investments in the quarter from an investment perspective as we worked with our customers to get some of these things and get some traction on early development. Obviously, we've invested in some capital to support some initiatives relative to tooling, some of these opportunities relative that range could be sizable. Obviously, we've got multiple partners with each of the applications, all the volatility we've talked about, who is ultimately going to end up winning is one factor, and then two, the commercial viability of whoever wins in the marketplace will also be another variable. So that's why it's a wide range for now, obviously, Eric highlighted, we were spending a ton of time on these initiatives across several different businesses. And I think we want more visibility coming out of the year and early first quarter, and be able to size that up a little bit better for you when we talk about 2021. Matt Summerville : And then maybe just another just quick question on M&A, would you say in the last 90 days or so. The actionability in the pipeline - the actionability in the funnel is actually getting better and what are you seeing from a multiple standpoint? Andy Silvernail : That was certainly the actionability I think is quite a bit better. I think everybody has found a way to actually do the work in a remote way. In many ways, everybody else is kind of get their head around the fact that this is going to be with us for a while and yet things are going to continue and businesses going to go on, all of that helps. And then of course, there is things - it seems like, there is ample liquidity as well, for certainly for us and for others. So the actionability is high, the process is slightly different. I would say on the valuation. There is not a lot of change. It's high. It's high and I think it's a long-term view and certainly for the businesses that we're going to be attracted to, they have tremendous long-term potential. And so those out years if anything we're looking at, we're anticipating are going to be strong and the sellers have a firm belief that that's the case as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Nathan Jones : Congratulations on the new role, Eric. And Andy, congratulations on pretty phenomenal 10-year run here. It's been my pleasure and privilege to work with you and get to know you over that time. So I'd like to wish you and your family all the best> Andy Silvernail : Thank you, Nathan. Nathan Jones : Just getting on to a few questions here on maybe some of the red dots on the end markets, energy and the analytical instrumentation. Just like to get your thoughts on the potential timing of recovery there. I mean, energy is probably a little bit longer than the analytical instrumentation side. But I think, Andy, you talked about focus on the vaccine taking away from - maybe some sales there, it looks like maybe we're getting towards a point where our vaccine is going to be out and available and production facilities will be put in place and maybe some of that focus moves around. So just any thoughts you have on timing of recovery in both of those businesses. Andy Silvernail : Yes. I'll touch on it first and let Eric, kind of go from there. The interesting thing is both, Eric and I were group executives in charge of that business at one point. So we won't know it really well. Look, I think what you're seeing here is, counterintuitive to what's happening in that marketplace, right. Because if you look at analytical instrumentation, one would think that immediately because there are health-related issues that it should be growing. The reality is that a lot of the stuff that happens in that big AI space is being pushed away right now because priorities are going over to other spend. It's very much our expectation that as we get into. I don't think any later than the mid-point next year, that starts to improve. And so obviously, we had a lot of confidence. It's a really good business for us. So Eric, your thoughts? Eric Ashleman : Yes, it's certainly the same thing. And then of course there is a consumables dynamic there, that's kind of out ahead of us. We're generally making the componentry for the equipment, so even if things recover, there is a little bit of a lag there as you go through a consumable stream and then into the actual devices themselves. But I agree with that. Nathan Jones : Any comments on the energy market and the potential pace of recovery there? Andy Silvernail : Yes. Well, on the energy side, of course, as you know, we tend to be more downstream and associated with things like custody transfer and mobile applications. And so, less resilient - or less tied to the wellhead in places like that. And so I think ultimately, we've seen a little bit of improvement here now. I mean obviously that that took a hard hit initially and some of this is probably pent up demand that's coming back, but I think it's going to be a while, it's going to be a while for the energy markets to kind of sort themselves out often when you get it down to where we do business. It depends on things like building trucks for mobile fleets that actually do the work of custody transfer. And so those are the kind of decisions that have to be made, the confidence that has to be there, but certainly we're much happier to be a little further down the stream than up in the front of it. Nathan Jones : And given top - sorry, go ahead. Eric Ashleman : So Nathan, the only thing I'd add is we talked about specific initiatives, we had an energy relative to lock last year that was a huge initiative for us. Obviously, that business this year has seen significant contraction, which is I think weighing on FMT a lot more than we had expected coming into the year. So just as folks will poke around a little bit on why FMT's margins and volumes are down a little bit more with a run rate business improving that was fairly large for that group, Andy Silvernail : Well, and that of course has a political question associated with it as well. Eric Ashleman : Yes, exactly. Nathan Jones : Is vehicle miles traveled really the best indicator we can look at for the energy business? Andy Silvernail : Let me jump in, on that one. One of the problems is kind of big macro things is we actually do business in a lot of the micro areas. And so, if you're going to make a big energy call, of course, that's going to influence us. But if you think about our business, we're at the micro level. Nathan Jones : Do you feel like the cost structure in those businesses that is struggling the most is aligned with demand now, are they targeted cost actions that you can, that you can take you? Andy Silvernail : So like we're taking the opportunity now to make some of those actions. We opened up a factory down in Oklahoma actually ahead of the pandemic, it's been a big assist to us. I mean, we intentionally built that with some extra floor space for any potential and we're leveraging that now, we're doing some structural work around the footprint of the Company, because I think this is a good time to think about sort of taking - taking a down situation and creating competitive advantage out of it. And by moving some of the structure around the way we are, it actually allows us to augment or increase some of the innovative potential we have in a business, while at the same time doing the right things and just base administration. And so we're - yes, we're, we're pretty active efforts underway in this area right now. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Graham with Rosenblatt Securities. Please proceed with your question. Scott Graham : I thought I was surprised when Larry resigned. And you took over Andy. This is double that, but for sure, you've had an amazing run here to say that you've had a good run is an understatement, great value creation, you and Eric are a terrific team. So, congrats to you, Andy. And, Eric anyone that knows you, knows that you're up for the challenge. So I love your line about this being a story of continuity. So thanks for the last nine years, Andy, and Eric look forward to the next 10 with you. Andy Silvernail : Thanks, Scott. Eric Ashleman : Thanks, Scott. Scott Graham : This is maybe more of - the first question is maybe more of a question for Bill the more - who's I'm certain is more of a mathematician than me, but could you walk us through the organic flowthrough of 37 and then the total flowthrough was 53 on the, on the operating income walk. I'm - I guess I'm having a little trouble, mass challenge that I can be on how we get there on $3 million of sale - $3 million of income, but maybe I'm just not understanding it. Bill Grogan : Yes. So maybe we'll start with that, so on the acquisition and FX piece that's $3 million of income on roughly $30 million of sales. So only a 10% contribution from that aspect, which is extremely dilutive to the overall margin. So when you exclude that, and you just look at our core business like-for-like last year versus this year, right, the cost actions, the things we've done within our core business materially reduce the organic flow through to from what we'd expect of 60% down to less than 40%. Scott Graham : That makes a lot of sense. So next question is same for you again here, Bill, what is the $13 million of discretionary look like in the fourth quarter and then sort of what are you looking at as sort of the reversals for next year with sales now starting to get better? Bill Grogan : Yes. I mean, we targeted once we get back to normal run rate levels. Obviously, discretionary expense relative to doing business post-COVID will be different but adding back about two-thirds of that on a consistent basis going forward. Yes, we ramped up our spend slightly in the third quarter probably up slightly again here in the fourth quarter with increased volumes. So-- although the network from all the way back if you're doing modeling I'd assume roughly 80% of that cost coming back on a longer-term basis. Scott Graham : One other question, if I may, the $25 million to $100 million range, which we've all been talking about. I didn't hear you say kind of where you are on that spectrum right now, I can see how really, you're focused on the areas that really are kind of for keeps areas. So that does become a part of the organic, but where are you on that curve? Bill Grogan : Well, with revenue year-to-date, obviously we're on - we're below the low and that's full-year run rate on an annualized basis. So we've got some wins that we started to experience obviously, in the first half of the year that have continued on here in Q4. I think some of the items that will ramp us to the top end of the range are things again we won't have full visibility here until we get into 2021. Andy Silvernail : Yes. And just to think about what those triggers are right. So some of them, as Bill said they're already there. We're already winning, it's already in the base business, so to speak, right. You'll - you won't lap that till the second half of next year for the most part. And then you've got some big digital events, right. So the work we're doing on COVID testing, the work we're doing on vaccines. As I said, last quarter, if those go in the right direction for us, they are huge wins and we'll get to the top end of the range fast, but if they don't, they're not there. So I caution anyone to build those into your models. The top end of that range until we have the know of whether we're aligned with wins and whether that has momentum. Operator : Our next question comes from Brett Linzey with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Brett Linzey : First, yes, congrats to Andy, appreciate all the years of insight and best of luck to Eric. Wanted to come back to the order trends, the improvement is encouraging, were you able to spike out how much of that improvement was market versus share gain. And I imagine you had some of the COVID opportunity wins in September, October orders, any color you could give us there? Andy Silvernail : Yes. So look, I think from a big piece of that is general market recovery, because so much of what we do at IDEX is a broad basket across a wide variety of industries. But no doubt, when we can see and isolate the places where we know we're winning share one of which we talked about here in the COVID story chapter in terms of some components that we already have placed that are helping that fight. But I would say the bulk of what you're seeing here in the near term is for sequential recovery of industrial markets that we participate in. Brett Linzey : And then, just wanted to shift back to the comments on the muni budgets and some of the work you're doing there. Do you expect a lagged effect into next year, is the backlogs get monetized they need to replenish? And just curious what you know - what some of that work that you're doing on budgets in those particular businesses is informing about the outlook there next year? Andy Silvernail : Yes, I would say, I mean, there is always a little bit of a lagging element in the municipal markets, and it's not - it's not ubiquitous you have some towns and municipalities that are pretty aggressive, and they are thinking through now the consequences and the actions. In some cases, that actually accelerate some work, if they're trying to spend money that they have available. I'd say the bulk of most of the market that we're interfacing with is stucked in the same variability that we are and are trying to imagine what could be in front of them as we go into 2021. Open questions of - in the case of the US Federal support, and whether or not, it comes or doesn't. So I think there is going to be a lagging element there that we're thinking about, but I - we're very close to our customers. We kind of do this town by town, jurisdiction by state province and municipality. And so for us it ultimately turns into a series of pins on a map, a bunch of discrete discussions that generally sum up the way I've described it, but we navigate through that field of opportunity as we go. Operator : Our next question is from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question. Rob Wertheimer : Andy, thanks for the reflections on a great run, it was wonderful distillation and Eric, on the comments and continuity and evolution. And I'd like to - if I can encourage us a little bit more of that, really my question is, given all that you and the organization has done with margins with the success of 80-20 and how margins have come up, it does seem like you can add more value to pools of capital you acquire versus what you might have expected seven or ten years ago. And so, does that mean that acquisitions could have a larger role in the future? Eric, you touched on this briefly. And then do you have specific sort of changes you're making to the organization to push that along, if so? Thanks. Andy Silvernail : Yes, sure. I appreciate the nature of the question, I'll take it. Yes to both questions. So as we become more evolved internally and better understood, frankly the impact of all of the work that we've done around 80-20 and the IDEX difference and we've seen us apply it to our own businesses and things that we've acquired along the way, it makes us more confidence about what we can do on the outside world. And so we've been very, very purposely thinking about that, we've built it into the modeling that we do as wherever - as we're looking at IDEX like businesses on the outside. And again, from an organizational perspective, a lot of the work that certainly I've been working on in the last few years is to get a number of leaders ready to begin to spend a significant amount of their time on this work. So we're doing that in the background. And then, I think going forward, look, as we said earlier, the valuations are high. Our discipline remains very, very tight and focused. And so, we're going to have to - we're going to have to spend the time beating the bushes to find these kind of opportunities, get them in front of us and analyze them thoroughly and that's going to take some resources as well. So one of the things we're thinking about as the world improves and things lever up is making some purposeful investments to support the continued evolution of this work and keeping at a very high priority. Rob Wertheimer : Okay. That's a helpful answer. Thank you. And then just if I can just add on one small one on the back of it. I mean do you expect as you do all that you'll have a consistent cadence on acquisitions and flow or - you're obviously not - you're still relatively small and can be opportunistic, you're thinking it can study out a bit or is that not in that part of the goal and just take opportunities where they come? And I'll stop. Thank you. Andy Silvernail : Well, I mean - I think there's always been a little bit of a sine wave at least in the time that I've been here, it seems like wins break. And it tends to come in clumps and so I think I think we're prepared to have it continue that way. I mean, we think about resourcing in a way that would support it. And so maybe intensively level loading, it wouldn't be something that we would do as a purposeful way to sort of balance things out because what it might do is actually causes to think about opportunities in a different way than we actually should. So I think there still be a little bit of kind of time-to-time some clustering that we will see, but we set up the organization and we certainly have the capital resources to be able to handle it that way. Operator : Our next question is from Joe Giordano with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question. Joe Giordano : Good afternoon, and congrats to Andy and Eric, both on their opportunities. So best of luck to you both. Andy Silvernail : Thanks. Joe Giordano : Yes. I wanted to just hear your comments on backlog going into the fourth quarter kind of at the higher end of what it normally might look like and I think, Allison touched on this earlier, but are you calculating haircutting a little bit with what you're saying or at least internally how you're talking to your people in terms of budgeting about just some of the stuff you're seeing over the last week and country starting to shut down, like how are you thinking about deployment of growth capital and things like that near term with some of these kind of more recent developments? Eric Ashleman : Well, so, look, I think we have a general approach here that is very agile, very reactive. And to be honest, what we're going through and what we're seeing here now, we planned for this back in March. I mean as soon as people started to recognize that there would likely be a second wave of the call. We built that into our thinking so the fact that we are in it now yes, that we're very cautious about the variability that's out there. We're super hesitant and unless we have to do it to put in kind of fixed cost back into the business given this environment. So let's treat it variably if we can, but I have to say that while it's certainly concerning for all of us as citizens in many ways, we sort of set this up as a planned event. We thought it would be here. It is here and we're going to stay as variable and agile as we can as we go through it. Joe Giordano : And Eric, you're taking over an organization that's in a really good spot and if you can replicate what's happened over the last 10 years, I think you'd be pretty happy with it. But just curious you're taking over an organization that's still then is like twice the size in terms of revenue as when Andy did. So, what kind of different things you have to think about just given the size of the organization and what's happened over the last decade? Eric Ashleman : Yes no, thanks. Well certainly, I mean this is a well-positioned company in a great spot. I will take that. I know it presents opportunities along the way, the bar is high and we need to continue to raise it. But I'm very, very thankful that it's in the state that it is now. That being said, as we go forward, there's things that we've talked about. We're certainly more of a global company today than we were even back when Andy joined. I think that even the things we think of acquiring and we have acquired the unit of measure is a little larger. We know the story that Andy talked about with our sealing business, we've done the work to integrate that and bring it together with other like businesses. And that will no doubt continue to be a chapter for us as we go forward. And that's - complex work that takes certain skill sets that we've been building for. So, as I said in the very beginning, I see an awful lot of continuity at play here to keep this company in a great position and take it forward. But there are those little nuances along the way that I think are appropriate that we have in mind that are going to take it to the next level. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Buscaglia : So first off, where you guys had - the commentary is very interesting on the HST segment with the $25 million to $100 million opportunity. So how do we - I hesitate to - like you said, put that in the model at this point, but I guess what are some headlines, or what should we be tracking to see if the likelihood of this is going forward? Or is it something that we cannot know you guys would have to know internally and wait for another update? Eric Ashleman : Well look, I think there is - a few environmental things that we can all track. This is - we're making an assumption here that as Andy said in the beginning that we're going to co-exist with this virus for quite a while. So even the vaccines that are planned to be here, we're anticipating that they're not going to going to wipe out necessarily the virus that's out there and there's going to be a continual need for testing of this type. So I think - all of us tracking that the requirements, the necessary nature of the kind of work that we're doing on both fronts is an environmental factor that would support this. But they're very specific, I mean these are - this is really specific technology science and commercial adoption that has to happen here. And as Bill said, I think certainly we'll give you an indication along the way when we reach different milestones and it's starting to find its way into our sales stream - order and sales stream. So, I think there is a slight environmental component, but a lot of it is very specific for us. Andrew Buscaglia : Yes, okay. Okay and with regard to the orders in the quarter. So that - it's nice to see those trending in the right direction exiting the quarter, where orders in any specific segment surprising to you throughout the quarter and how they trended specifically FMT - I'm curious, how that trended each month, and does there seems to be the laggard here obviously important segment to the story? Bill Grogan : Yes and I would say - Andy referred to it, we saw improvement across all three segments obviously FMT is lagging a little bit relative to the end-market exposures, but the pickup we saw on a month-to-month basis was pretty close linearly to how we performed overall. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Andrew Silvernail for closing comments. Andy Silvernail : Yes, thank you very much. Look, I do have a few closing comments. One, just around the business, as a whole and two just a few thank you's that I'd like to set out and then I'll turn it over to Eric - to wrap it up. So, look as I exit this company. Yes, I appreciate the position that we're in and the quality of this business. It is an awesome business, as I answered, Allison's question and I walked through those four things : quality of business, matters an awful lot and mission matters an awful lot. And we're in a great spot. Second, we've got positive momentum frankly I would never have made the decision to leave IDEX, if we were in the spot. We had been in at the end of the first quarter and the second quarter and it gives me great confidence. And as long as I'm alive my name is going to be associated with IDEX and I want this company to absolutely blow the doors off and we have really good momentum. And then the last thing is there is a great team. Oftentimes, the investment community focus is on a singular person and it's just never so and under my time as the leader of this company. We've been successful because we've had a great team and Eric has a great team, as we go forward. So, I have a lot of confidence in where this business is going. And just a few thank you's. First, I want to thank everybody at IDEX, as I mentioned before, this is just been a privilege and the highlight of my professional career to work with all of you. I can't tell you how many days, I've gone home and had conversations with my wife and conversations with my kids about the joy to work with the people at IDEX. You're just first rate, there is nobody in the world to hold the candle to you guys and you brought me just incredible joy and I just want to thank you very much. To the investor and the analyst community, everybody on the phone here today and those who might listen, sometimes is a bad rap, that between a company, management and the investment community, that somehow, it's just negative Bs that exist. And for me anyway, it just isn't true. There are a lot of you guys on the phone today, you guys are my friends and you have helped me get better, you've pushed us to get better, you've asked a difficult question. And difficult questions are how you get better and it's one of the things we do it IDEX all the time we asked a difficult question. And part of that comes because you guys ask the difficult question. And it's just been a privilege to work with you. And then just to my friend, Eric excuse me. We have worked together for 12 years, and people think about professional relationship and we obviously have that. But he is also my dear friend and as much as I am glad that I made him better, as a leader. He has made me equally, if not more, better, as a leader. And there is not a better executive in the world I have ever worked with than Eric and this company is in great hands. Eric Ashleman : Well, thank you very much for that. Thanks very much for that. As we often do we end in a lot of the same summary points. I think this business is really, really well positioned. I couldn't be more excited about where it is now and where it's going to go. This transition is smooth and seamless. We are going to execute this, everybody is leaning forward here and our priority priorities are constant. I just like - feel really, really good here. And that's the first question, I think is the right one. I mean we know it's important. We worked on it together and we're going to continue to legacy and the work that you've done, Andy. Few people, I'd like to thank as well. I'd certainly like to thank all the hardworking folks across IDEX. I'm excited to be continuing the journey with them. I'd like to thank our Board, for their confidence and support. And then I absolutely would like to thank my friend, Andy. It has been an amazing run from that very first day he came to my business in 2009 and introduced himself. And so after a long time, we're transitioning from boss and partner to mentor, and continued friend. Thank you very much. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And we thank you for your participation.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Mike Yates, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for IDEX Corporation. Thank you. You may begin. Mike Yates : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. This is Mike Yates, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for IDEX Corporation. Let me start by saying, thank you for joining us for a discussion of the IDEX fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial highlights. Last night we issued a press release outlining our company's financial and operating performance for the three months and the year ending December 31, 2020. The press release, along with the presentation slides to be used during today's webcast can be accessed on our company's website at www.idexcorp.com. Joining me today is Eric Ashleman, our Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Grogan, our Chief Financial Officer. The format for our call today is as follows : we will begin with Eric providing an overview of the state of IDEX's businesses, including a recap of our recent performance and how we are viewing 2021. Eric will then provide an update on a few initiatives that we believe are key to IDEX's culture, before moving into a review of our order performance and providing our 2021 outlook for our end markets. Bill will then discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial results. And we'll conclude with an outlook for the first quarter and full year 2021. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. If you should need to exit the call for any reason, you may access the complete replay, beginning approximately two hours after the call concludes, by dialing the toll-free number 877-660-6853 and entering conference ID 13712088. Or you may simply log on to our company\u2019s homepage for the webcast replay. Before we begin, a brief reminder. This call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the Safe Harbor language in last night's press release in IDEX's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I'll turn the call over to our CEO. Eric? Eric Ashleman : Thank you, Mike. I'd like to start by thanking our people all around the world who have risen to the occasion during such a challenging year. It's been a year full of challenge and change, with the numerous safety protocols and disruptions in the marketplace. In that environment, our people continue to shine. So to all the IDEX team members listening in on this call, thank you. Because of the protocols we have in place, the disruptions in our operations have been limited. The COVID trends across Europe, North America and India have been troubling and we continue to follow those developments closely and remain steadfast in providing a safe place for our employees to work. We continue to deliver solutions for our customers during a challenging year, focusing on the critical innovation we need to support our long-term strategy, as well as producing new products to help the fight against the pandemic. Bill will walk through the details shortly. With customer focused strong execution and our ability to react quickly to unpredictable events, helped us deliver a relatively strong performance in 2020, a true testament to our resiliency. Liquidity was a primary focus of our management strategy as the pandemic hit and I'm happy to say that we were able to drive record free cash flow this year. As we address the challenges in front of us, we see a path to bullishness for 2021. We have seen a steady recovery in our end markets, which we will detail in a few slides. The diversity and quality of our businesses continues to serve us well, ensuring that we can weather any storm and quickly capitalize when market conditions improve. While the pandemic still presents many challenges to solve, we are starting to see a focus pivot back to core commercial endeavors, as we and our customers prepare for a world healed from the ravages of COVID-19. Our businesses remain focused on operating safely and we are prepared to leverage our supply chains and react to increased demands. A year like 2020 truly test the culture of a company. Are you rooted in strong values that people really live and believe? If so, you'll be better prepared to survive and even thrive. IDEX is that kind of company and it served us well in a year none of us could have ever predicted. I'm proud of the culture we have built at IDEX. It is admired by many, but we can strengthen it still. We leverage our culture and mission to bind together a uniquely decentralized and diverse company and our commitment to work even harder to support diversity equity and inclusion is tied directly to this important aspect of IDEX differentiation. Our resiliency, agility and fundamental ability to execute have IDEX exceptionally well positioned to play off as aggressively as we move forward. We are actively investing to support our best organic growth bets and we have ramped up our capital spending to support very exciting initiatives. The M&A markets are moving again and we are expanding our capabilities to execute on strategic acquisitions. In January, we announced an agreement to acquire ABEL Pumps and expect that deal to close in the first quarter. We actively seek to deploy additional capital to acquire IDEX-like businesses, as well as make some calculated bets in new technologies, to bolster our growth potential to further strengthen our portfolio and enhance our return to shareholders. Moving to slide seven. As I just mentioned, the strength of IDEX comes from the IDEX difference, a teachable methodology where great teams working together in a superior culture focused on the critical things that matter with a natural orientation towards the most important needs of their customers. Our culture is a significant focus and one of my key leadership priorities. To that end, we are making ongoing improvements based on feedback we received from our employees every day. Last month the IDEX Foundation, which was created to positively impact the communities in which we live and work, took a significant step forward as part of these efforts. IDEX committed $6 million to boost sponsored activities across the company. The foundation formerly added equity and opportunity as a lasting and fully funded part of its mission, creating opportunities for underserved disadvantaged people of color in our communities. This donation allows the foundation to more than double its annual giving. In addition to initiatives focused on equity and opportunity, we will continue the great work our people have been doing in our communities like building homes for the homeless, renovating community centers, and supporting schools and learning opportunities for young people. This month, we will host more than a dozen facilitative employee focus groups around the world. The feedback from our employees will help shape our path forward in diversity equity inclusion. Developing a formal framework and goals for our DE&I program is something we have all deployed at the senior leadership level making it a top priority. As part of that commitment, I intend to have a Senior DE&I leader in place reporting directly to me later this year. We will continue to grow and advance our culture as a key element of differentiation. You have my commitment on that. Turning now to our commercial results on slide eight. Broad rebound in order rates we discussed in the third quarter continued as our fourth quarter organic orders were up 7% compared to the prior year. We entered the quarter with optimism based on the strength of the third quarter improvement and that continued into the fourth quarter. Excluding timing on large OEM blanket orders year-over-year, our monthly order rates improved throughout the quarter. FMT organic orders for the fourth quarter were up 3%, driven by project orders in our water businesses continued strength in agriculture and recovery in industrial day rate businesses. HST organic orders were up 6% in the fourth quarter, driven by new product initiatives in life sciences and the recovery in auto and semicon continuing to boost our Sealing Solutions businesses. Finally, Fire & Safety/Diversified organic orders were up 15% in the quarter. Dispensing saw significant improvement as retailers began to release pent-up demand for equipment refreshes banded after a strong bounce back in the third quarter continued to improve based on auto market strength. And Fire & Safety saw growth in several product lines. A year ago, as we entered 2020, we talked about the general industrial slowdown that we were seeing and what a flat to down 2% to 5% world looked like for IDEX. We have proactively taken strategic actions to address these factors. We then faced the onset of the pandemic and we responded to it with purpose. As we close out 2020 and look forward, we are optimistic that our units and markets are quickly on a path to pre-COVID levels. The actions that we took in 2019 and 2020 have left us well positioned as we move into 2021. Turning to slide nine. We provide our current outlook for primary end markets. In our Fluid & Metering Technology segment, industrial day rates continue to tick up in the fourth quarter further solidifying the optimism that we discussed last quarter. We see this increase driven largely by OpEx needs of our customers. We continue to see large capital projects remain on hold. We anticipate that broader signs of economic stability and higher degrees of certainty on COVID recovery timing is required before capital projects begin to move again. But the investment discussions are happening. Our Water business has continued to show resiliency and we are closely monitoring the toll that 2020 will take on municipal budgets in 2021 and beyond. The strength in agriculture that we've called out for the previous two quarters has continued and we expect it to grow in 2021. Energy markets continue to remain challenged with markets still down compared to 2019 levels. Stabilization of these businesses is largely dependent on increases in fuel prices driving new capital investments in oil and gas. Turning to the Health and Science Technologies segment. As we discussed last quarter we have identified opportunities and applications to help fight COVID across each of our segments but particularly in HST. We were able to drive approximately $30 million of revenue in 2020 and expect to generate about the same amount in 2021 related to these initiatives. While some of this revenue is one-time in nature, we believe the technologies and applications we have developed here will generate recurring opportunities in 2022 and beyond. So, relative to our $25 million to $100 million of opportunities we highlighted, we'll achieve about $60 million. AI improved during the fourth quarter and looks to be on the rebound in 2021. In life sciences, we saw an offset by continued weakness in IVD/BIO as lab capacity is still largely focused on COVID response putting on hold other projects and initiatives. The strength in semicon that we mentioned last quarter has continued. In addition our ceilings business has benefited from a rebound in automotive. We see continued recovery in 2021 for the auto market, particularly driven by strength in European car sales in China and India. Food and pharma has also remained a bright spot as our businesses continue to benefit from growth in MPT projects and Microfluidics business. Moving to the Fire & Safety/Diversified segment, we saw continued improvement in most of our markets. The largest driver was the significant improvement in the dispensing market as large retailers increase demand for equipment refreshes, combined with order strength in the Asia dispensing markets. As mentioned previously, the pace of the auto recovery continues to exceed expectations springing on our BAND-IT business. Fire & Rescue businesses continued to see strong order performance and we believe that we are seeing a recovery in the OEM businesses driving through some of the delays in backlog concerns we referenced last quarter. As with all our municipal businesses, we continue to closely monitor the impact on budgets to see if there are any lagging effects from COVID response spending. As I highlighted in my previous remarks, we are optimistic about the market recovery we are seeing across most of our markets. And we need to be prepared for potential interruptions, particularly in the first half of 2021. Our teams have shown the ability to address these short-term shocks proactively. And the strategic actions we have taken across our businesses, has us well positioned to be able to ride the positive momentum, we're seeing as we exit the issue of the pandemic. With that, I'll turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results for the quarter and full year. Bill Grogan : Thanks, Eric. I'll start with our consolidated financial results on slide 11. Q4 orders of $679 million were up 10% overall and up 7% organically. Organic orders increased across each of our segments, with drivers highlighted by Eric in his previous comments. For the year orders were down 3% overall and down 4% organically, with strong organic order recovery in the fourth quarter, partially offsetting the 18% organic order decline we saw in the second quarter at the height of the pandemic. Fourth quarter sales of $615 million were up 2% overall, but down 1% organically. Our industrial and energy markets led the decline, but did have positive organic growth of around 60% of our reporting units led by strong performance in our ceilings MPT and dispensing businesses. Full year sales of $2.4 billion were down 6% overall and down 9% organically, driven by the impact of COVID, industrial market softness and challenges in oil and gas. Q4 gross margins contracted 20 basis points to 43.8%, driven by a decline in volume and unfavorable sales mix, partially offset by price capture. For the full year, gross margins contracted 140 basis points. Excluding the impact of the FMD inventory step-up, adjusted gross margins contracted 130 basis points to 43.9% driven by volume declines in sales mix, offset by our continued ability to capture price and drive operational productivity. Fourth quarter operating margin was 22.6%, up 50 basis points compared to prior year. Full year operating margin was 22.1%, down 110 basis points compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 23.4% for the fourth quarter, up 10 basis points compared to prior year and 22.8% for the year, down 140 basis points compared to 2019. I'll discuss the drivers of operating income on the following slide. Our Q4 effective tax rate was 22.2%, which was higher than the prior year ETR of 20.6%, due to the revaluation of foreign deferred income tax balances driven by changes in foreign tax rates. Fourth quarter adjusted net income was $105 million, resulting in an EPS of $1.37, up $0.04 or 3% over prior year adjusted EPS. Full year adjusted net income was $397 million, resulting in adjusted EPS of $5.19, down $0.61 or 11% compared to prior year. Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $149 million, up 9% compared to prior year and was 142% of adjusted net income. For the year, free cash flow was $518 million, a record for IDEX, up 9% versus last year and 131% of adjusted net income driven by strong working capital performance. Moving on to slide 12. We're going to review our full year adjusted operating income. As Eric mentioned, we faced unprecedented challenges in 2020, but the structural and discretionary actions we took were critical to lessen the volume impact on our income and margins. Using a similar framework as we have for the previous two quarters, we wanted to walk through the components of our full year adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income declined $66 million for the year. With organic sales down around $247 million, we would have expected a negative impact in operating income of $148 million at roughly 60% contribution margin rate. The $148 million was offset by $58 million of executed operational actions, $23 million from the impact of restructuring actions combined with $35 million of discretionary cost control items and $10 million of price net productivity and negative business mix. Finally, we had $7 million of reduced variable compensation for the year. This yielded a better than expected flow-through of 34%. Again organic flow-through is based on taking reported sales and op income less the impact of FX and acquisitions, which was roughly $77 million on the top line and $7 million of profit. Overall, our team's focused on quickly managing the crisis at hand and effectively managing costs to mitigate revenue declines and has IDEX well positioned to leverage the recovery we expect in 2021. Moving on to guidance, I'm on slide 13. Based on current order rates and expected market recoveries, we see an accelerating 2021 and expect organic revenue for the year to be up 6% to 8%. This translates to an EPS impact of roughly $0.75 to $0.95 depending on our top line results. We expect our productivity initiatives to more than offset inflation providing $0.04 of benefits. The structural cost actions we have taken are expected to provide $0.12 of EPS benefit in the year. As we move past the pandemic we will aggressively invest in both organic and inorganic opportunities. As business recovers we will loosen discretionary cost controls as appropriate. As mentioned previously, we expect approximately two-thirds of the discretionary cost to return over time. Additionally, we will be making investments to enhance our ability to execute and integrate M&A opportunities as we view this as a critical time to enhance our capabilities, as well as continue to fund our targeted organic growth initiatives. These discretionary add-backs and strategic investments will provide approximately $0.19 to $0.26 of pressure in our 2021 guidance. Next we anticipate $0.08 to $0.11 headwind from variable compensation as we reset our incentive comp for the year. Finally FMD has 1/4 of inorganic results which we expect to provide $3 million of revenue, but provide $0.03 of EPS pressure. The structural actions we have made to improve FMD's profit profile based on the situation in the energy market will get FMD back to positive op profit in the second quarter. Now let's take a look at a couple of non-operational items. First we expect an $0.18 headwind from tax primarily related to discrete benefits we realized in 2020 associated with equity vesting and option exercising. Second, we expect a 2% tailwind from FX providing $0.13 of EPS benefit. So in summary we are projecting organic revenue growth of 6% to 8% for the year and EPS expectations are in the range of $5.65 to $5.95, a 9% to 15% increase over 2020. Moving to Slide 14. Let me provide some additional details regarding our 2021 guidance for both the first quarter and full year. In Q1 we are projecting EPS to range from $1.38 to $1.42 with organic revenue growth of 2% to 4% and operating margins of approximately 23.5%. The Q1 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23%. We expect a 3% top line benefit from the impact of FX and corporate costs in the first quarter are expected to be around $18 million. Turning to some additional details for the full year guidance. Again we're projecting full year EPS in the range of $5.65 to $5.95 with full year organic revenue to be up 6% to 8% with operating margins between 23.5% to 24.5%. We expect FX to provide a 2% benefit to top line results. The full year effective tax rate is expected to be around 23%. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be around $55 million. And free cash flow is expected to be between 115% to 120% of net income. Corporate costs are expected to be approximately $70 million for the year. Finally our earnings guidance excludes any associated cost or earnings with future acquisitions or restructuring charges. Abel Pump is not included in these estimates and we will revise guidance once that deal is closed. With that I'll throw it back to Eric for some final thoughts. Eric Ashleman : Thanks Bill. Before questions, I would like to once again thank our employees and stakeholders for their contributions to what I consider exceptional execution in a challenging environment. We have proven the resilience of our businesses and clearly demonstrated the impact of the IDEX difference in our operating model. While we are not completely out of the woods this is a time for optimism. And I believe that our businesses are well positioned to focus on the critical priorities that will accelerate our growth on the other side of the pandemic. With that let me pause and turn it over to the operator for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Allison Poliniak : Want to go back to your comment Eric on M&A and this concept of technology and investing there, could you maybe give us a little bit of color on what that means in terms of size or if there's verticals? And then also how are you reconciling those opportunities with the historical discipline that IDEX has always held with M&A? Eric Ashleman : Yes. Well it's great to talk to you Allison. Thank you. So look I -- we talked a little bit here before about obviously we think that the technology cycle is compressed a lot. And no doubt it was already kind of flying in a dynamic way. So as we're thinking about that at IDEX, we're thinking about organic bets and development that we're going to do internally, but no doubt we're going to have to appropriate some of this from the outside world. And I think that -- you can think of that as a range of technologies. I mean for a lot of our component products it's probably going to come down to things like sensors and data readouts. From other businesses that we have it might be more analytical in nature. So it's going to take some of the inputs that we're able to provide in a severe duty space and come up to some determinant outcome and present that to our customers. So I think it would run the gamut from -- everything from embedded sensors and control elements up to frankly some software pieces that might be out there that would stick and sit very nice comfortably next to some pieces of our business. And I just think ultimately the call on that is going to be speed, speed and the ability to impact a solution in a way that we think will give us some differentiated edge. No doubt, when you're looking at assets especially on the inorganic side the economics can often work in different ways. And so we challenge our teams to think about value creation in a different way as well, in terms of how it might extend our solution bring us closer to customers lead to other open doors. So we're spending an awful lot of time on that as a team; Bill and I and the rest of the senior team and really putting our heads together and what that will look like for IDEX but we're excited about it. Allison Poliniak-Cusic: That's helpful. And then I just want to go to your comment on capital projects. It sounds like you're getting some inquiries or they're starting to increase there. But the balance of that going forward potentially sounds like it's almost like a reopening kind of theme there. Are you feeling like there's starting to be sort of this pent-up demand as people look out into the balance of 2021? Just any thoughts there. Eric Ashleman : Yes. Well I think so. As you know I mean, especially I'll just take the FMD segment in general. There's a ton of support there on the day rate side and much of the improvement that we've seen in Q3 and Q4 and that's where it's coming from. The system is working. People are adding shifts. There's just more output. And we come along with that. And then there's an important component of project business that we would need to see to kind of take it to the next level. And I will say that you don't see a lot of that yet in the actual order numbers that we have as good as they are. But the discussions that support that the discussions around spec points and applications and problems that we can solve you can feel that building. And I think that's behind some of the optimism that we feel, coming ahead particularly as the virus the course of the virus becomes more understood. Allison Poliniak-Cusic: Great. Thanks a lot. I\u2019ll pass it along. Eric Ashleman : Thanks, Allison. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Eric Ashleman : Hi, Deane. Deane Dray : Hey, Eric. So congratulations. You get your first quarter under your belt. And as we look at the results and the quality of the earnings it looks just like vintage IDEX and seeing the incrementals come back. But could you share with us any like high-level thoughts here now where do you think you'll be focusing a little bit differently where might there be an Eric imprint here as CEO? Is \u2013 I suspected a lot of it is just continued focus on 80 :20 and the IDEX way but just broad strokes how you're thinking about that now? Eric Ashleman : Yes. Sure Deane. Look I think some of it we touched on in my opening comments. I mean I would actually start with the cultural aspects. I think one of the reasons we performed as well as we have we've been as nimble as we have I mean it really comes back to what we built here in terms of a culture and an organizational mentality that allows us to course correct and really focus on things without frankly a lot of control coming from Bill or I or the rest of the team. So in an environment that probably has even more of that, going to the next level there is hugely important. Then I think, partially thinking back a bit to the comments around Allison's question technology and how that's going to layer across the solution sets that we have at IDEX, recognizing we've got a lot of different states of evolution depending on the companies, that's a place where I'm spending an awful lot of time to make sure that we're thoughtful and not in some ways kind of overdoing it with a center-led answer because that's not really the appropriate response. And then I would end with certainly capital allocation and a lot of focus on how we can frankly put some more of it to work. The environment's tough but we're doing some things around focused resources, focused pieces of the company and a lot of just very iterative thinking as a team of how we can tackle that and frankly capitalize on the engine that we really built over the last two years. I mean I think we're uniquely positioned here even in a difficult environment to bring that to bear. Deane Dray : That's really helpful. And I think you've given some good insight into how you're thinking about the end markets, that Page 9 was especially helpful, as was the bridge that Bill walked us through. So if I could just take a moment and ask for more specifics on your muni outlook, because that came up a couple of different times where you talked about the toll that COVID is taking. But there's like two pieces to muni. One is water, which tends to be more resilient in Fire & Rescue a little more CapEx. But what are your assumptions on muni budgets and spending here on those two areas? Eric Ashleman : Yes. I mean, no doubt that's definitely an area that we're watching with a lot of focus. As you know, I mean those markets tend to lag an awful lot. And so something bad happens in the world and it takes a while for it to read through. And then of course, if you think of kind of our exposure layered on top of it, particularly the two areas that you mentioned, we're doing very important work that that many times is buffered against some of it. So on the water side we're heavily tilted towards the analytical side, analytical services and support. And so even if a system has to make do with infrastructure might have to delay some kind of \u2013 lay out a heavy infrastructure, they often turn to our kind of work to make sure that they're leveraging the system that they do have. Frankly, also on the water side, I mean if we go into an era, where the environmental compliance has stepped up a bit, that's another dynamic that helps us there. So that's against that sort of other trend that we are watching around budget support and budget assurance. So the two things are kind of working there together but we see that same resiliency. Fire & Rescue, again this is one of the most global stories that we have. And so no doubt in the more mature spaces CapEx purchases, considering where the source of that funding is going to come from is always something that we're thinking about and tracking. But we are \u2013 we course, correct a bit here. And so it's a different story in some of the emerging markets where we've got great presence and frankly a lot of technology and people on the ground. So I think that global breadth helps us on that side as well. But no doubt we're watching the same dynamics that you all are. As we go forward, we're looking to see if there's backstopping and support or not all over the world and -- but we think we're well positioned. Deane Dray : Appreciate it. Thank you. Eric Ashleman : Thanks, Deane. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Mike Halloran : Hey, good morning everyone. Eric Ashleman : Hi, Mike. Mike Halloran : So let's start on the demand curve here. Obviously, understand the optimism comments. Really good to hear. Is that -- how is that optimism embedded in the guidance range? How are you thinking about trends as you work through the year here? And any commentary on how customers are thinking about what their spend patterns look like, and how much optimism is there in the channel when you're having those conversations? And I guess one more tail to that what do you think that means for the next couple of years? Bill Grogan : Mike maybe I'll start off with the first part of your question relative to how we're thinking about pacing through the year in our guidance, I think, it's kind of consistent sequential improvement as we progress through the year. When you look at the 6% to 8% and where we are in the first quarter, there is kind of a gradual improvement that we need to achieve each quarter that's reasonable. When you think about the 6% to 8% between the segments, HST a little bit on the high end FMT and the middle and FSD on the lower side. So, generally balanced with small sequential improvements as we progress. And obviously, we have some targeted growth things that will phase out through the year that could inflect that plus or minus. But we're not looking for significant growth in any specific quarter as we progress through the year. Eric Ashleman : Yes. Mike I just would continue to point to, I mean, in many ways what we're calling internal is sort of predictable uncertainty. There's a lot of stuff going on no doubt, but it's at least found a level where one of the things we've noticed all around the world is certainly -- we're going to keep the machines on keep the factories running, keep the borders open, keep product moving. It might be difficult at times, but that assurance is there. And certainly with some good signs in terms of virus mitigation that provides another piece of assurance. And then I think most people recognize, there's a lot of pent-up energy more broadly that if things continue to go this way, it would be released at some point. And again IDEX has such broad exposure. We think we'd participate in that. Mike Halloran : So, third question just maybe some thoughts on supply chains how they look for you specifically; what channel inventories look like? And then lastly, how are you thinking about price cost dynamics? Eric Ashleman : Yes sure. On -- with no doubt the supply chain is tricky to maneuver. I mean, we're seeing that as well as everybody else. I mean, the ports are clogged up and they've got some staffing issues in both of the coasts. And the containers are in the wrong places all of that stuff. And just frankly, there's not enough aircraft in the sky. So we're not immune to that. However, as you know, we are very localized generally in terms of our supply our production and our sell-through into markets. It's a very localized model. And so I think relative to a lot of people we probably don't experience it at the same levels  Our teams now for quite a while frankly even going back to the times where we were talking a lot more about tariffs and things like that have been thinking about where we have key sources of supply how we can make that frankly more flexible. And to this day every Tuesday we kind of go around the horn and talk both about kind of how we're holding up in terms of the virus how we're navigating supply chains. And fortunately we've been able to react and navigate around that and that's the go-forward assumption for us. Mike Halloran : Appreciate it. Thank you. Eric Ashleman : Thanks Mike. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question. Matt Summerville : Thanks and good morning guys. Can you maybe talk about a little bit about the order of cadence you experienced through the quarter? It sounds like things got better what you've seen so far in January and if you wouldn't mind adding some geographic overlay to that as well. Eric Ashleman : Yes. So relatively the order pattern through the quarter we mentioned it a little bit in the prepared remarks our day rate businesses continue to progress as we march through the fourth quarter. We had some timing of OEM blanket that made the absolute month numbers a little bit choppy. But for the things that we look as indicator the sequential improvement was there and that's continued on to January with another positive month of broad-based order improvement across all of our businesses. On the geographic side, I think it was a really strong performance in Asia in Europe. And North America lagged a little bit only because of hey that's where most of our core industrial and energy exposure is. It was the only area that was the lowest out of the 3 but again still sequentially improving. Matt Summerville : And then realizing dispensing's a fairly small piece of overall IDEX it can still kind of bounce around FSD a bit. I would imagine some of the orders you received maybe for future periods. Is there any sort of sequential cadence we should be thinking about as it pertains to FSD because of some of that lumpiness as we fine-tune our models? Eric Ashleman : Yes. It's obviously a strong order quarter for dispensing. I would say it's going to pace out through the first three quarters of the year for the most part maybe a little bit more heavily weighted towards the first two quarters, because we did receive some orders for the full year from several customers. Matt Summerville : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Rosenblatt Securities. Please proceed with your question. Scott Graham : Hey, good morning. Eric congratulations on your first solo quarter. Good luck. Eric Ashleman : Thank you, Scott. Scott Graham : So I wanted to maybe get a little bit more on your 6% to 8% organic for the year, which obviously suggests a pretty steady, but pretty healthy improvement 2Q, 3Q, 4Q. And maybe specifically in FMT, where you're kind of saying that's sort of like in the middle what are the markets that you're looking at in FMT that are going to be the drivers for that level of growth as the year progresses? Eric Ashleman : Well, I mean, as you know, Scott, I mean, FMT is such a broad collection catch-all of a wide variety of industrial markets. But it \u2013 honestly it runs the gamut. So food production is in there. Anything related to \u2013 starting to work on infrastructure and build-out of highways and buildings and things we're going to participate there as well. So the chemical sector kind of coming back to life. We've got a significant presence there. I mean, it really is that sort of broad-based support coming from the industrial sector largely in kind of our mature geographic markets that just day rates that's kind of in the first chapter of it. I think the projects that we talked about earlier are starting to come on starting to get funded. You put those two things together that's sort of what the picture would look like in it. We see it as a pretty steady march. I mean, it's not like a hockey stick out there. We just think the line sort of continues as the world heals. Scott Graham : Right. Well, you're shorter cycle, so that makes sense. Bill one for you. Could you give us an idea, I know you guys have been kind enough in the past to kind of share with us your revenues that are from OpEx which includes the day rates versus CapEx. What was the exit rate on that? Bill Grogan : I would say, it's more heavily OpEx related. Again to Eric's comments relative to the larger capital projects, I think the conversations around those are picking up. We haven't seen a significant increase in order book relative to those things falling through the unknown. Scott Graham : Would you say Bill that OpEx is maybe 70%, 75% of the revenue run rate right now? Bill Grogan : Yeah, plus or minus. It's around there. Scott Graham : Great. Thanks. Eric Ashleman : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Buscaglia : Good morning, guys. I wanted to focus on Health & Science Technologies for a second. So you gave some color there on the rapid tests coming roughly in line with kind of what you thought revenue-wise. But what are the puts and takes elsewhere in the business throughout the year? Because it seems \u2013 I 'm actually surprised that life sciences is more stable and analytically instrumentation just given what we're seeing with other companies. I don't know. I guess, what are you seeing in 2021 in that segment and how that is going to ebb and flow throughout the year? Eric Ashleman : Well, I mean, look I think the analytical instrumentation story for us it's a pretty mature business. It was \u2013 obviously it faced some headwinds last year like a lot of life sciences did related to sort of up and down the street medical things and analytical services. We did see a nice bounce back there in the fourth quarter for AI. I think it kind of returns to its sort of historical rates as we go forward. The IVD/BIO side, which is also pretty mature that's the one that's still got the most pressure on it. It's much more dependent on people going and visiting labs and then has a consumable stream that tends to be out ahead of capital purchases and that's kind of where we come in. So consider that a bit of an offset to the AI story. And then pretty quickly, we get into the more dynamic pieces of this related to the works that we do in genomics. And obviously, the rapid test is the most dynamic of them all. So we put all that together. I think we tried to lay that out here. But I would say in general look this is a robust sector. It's obviously doing work that the world needs right now. We think we're well positioned in all of it. And the single biggest catalyst for us still remains that that work we're doing around the testing program. Andrew Buscaglia : Okay. Is \u2013 based on your orders order trends what \u2013 I guess, looking out to 2021 for the full year, is it safe to say Fluid & Metering probably leads followed by HST and then Fire & Safety, or I guess can you rank order those organically? Bill Grogan : For orders or sales? Andrew Buscaglia : For sales I mean. Bill Grogan : Yeah. No, I think I mentioned a little bit earlier. I think HST is probably on the higher end FMC is down the middle and FSD's on the low end. If you picked \u2013 Andrew Buscaglia : Okay. Sorry I missed that. Okay. And then just one last one. On M&A, you guys indicated a quarter or two ago that there were some deals in HST perking up. Anything \u2013 any update there or anything just broadly on M&A? Eric Ashleman : Well, look as I said in the \u2013 both in the comments at the beginning and some of the questions here, I mean, we've got a lot of work going on in frankly all three segments. So I wouldn't say, that one is tilted more than the other. I mean we've got good opportunities in all three. We've got teams associated in and positioned in places where we're focused in all three. So, I'd hesitate to color it, as landed one way or another. Andrew Buscaglia : Okay. All right. Thank you guys. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Giordano with Cowen. Please proceed with your questions. Francisco Amador : Hey guys. Good morning. This is Francisco on for Joe. I wanted to ask with regards to slide 9 which is obviously very helpful, your general thoughts on automotive. We've seen some headlines on potential production cuts coming from the shortage in semiconductors. How exposed are you to that, and if you can just provide some incremental commentary there, please? Eric Ashleman : Yeah. Well, I mean, no doubt, we've seen the same headlines. I mean, this is still a relatively small piece of IDEX. I mean, we have exposure there in a couple of businesses and none of which is related to the electronics side. So, look, I think what we've seen so far the momentum is the recovery of an industry that was largely kind of shutdown for decent parts of the year. And then, frankly, most of our growth there is through growth of platforms. The technologies where we're actually focused, our team has done just a great job of being able to introduce that to more and more people, more and more players in the market. And then, secure those wings. And then -- wins and we would see them run out over several years. So, we haven't seen a big interruption. But again, we're not in that sort of same area the part spends. And we've got really good exposure to the platform wins in a couple of businesses. Francisco Amador : Thanks. That's helpful. And just going back quickly to the M&A topic, just on the environment, would you say, it's more favorable than it was a couple of quarters ago? I think you guys mentioned, at some point that, multiples were still pretty high and people were maybe not as willing to sell. How has that changed in the last couple of months? Eric Ashleman : Well, I mean, like the valuation remains certainly high and rich. And maybe because of that and some of the confidence that, we're seeing generally put those two things together I would say, the flow of properties for sale is better. And it continues to grow, kind of with the confidence in insurance, kind of same things that we're citing here. So, valuation was frankly high before. We think it's high now. We think it will stay at these elevated levels as we go forward. That's the challenge for us. But, we think we've got the -- certainly have the firepower to do the work both in terms of the teams the franchises we're thinking of building around and the demonstrated ability to execute and drive value in a company. Francisco Amador : Great. Thank you very much. Eric Ashleman : Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back to management, for closing remarks. Eric Ashleman : Okay. Well, hey, thanks for everybody joining. And I know there's always a lot of IDEX folks that join this call as well. So, I do want to -- once again I want to thank, everybody across IDEX for the really, really hard work and solid execution in 2020 and frankly a great start already to the year here. So thank you for your efforts there. I think, as you can see, I mean, we're pretty -- we're cautiously bullish. And we're leaning forward. We're generally optimistic about, where things are going here. No doubt, there's a lot of uncertainty that's still out there. But I think if we learned anything in 2020, it's how resilient everybody is. And how quickly we can kind of course correct and I think our company does that, better than many. So, we've got the people in place. We've got the teams. We've got focus. And I'm just really, really pleased to be here and leading the charge with Bill and others. So, thanks for your interest and time today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines, at this time. And have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the IDEX Corporation First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Michael Yates, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer. Thank you, you may begin. Michael Yates : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. This is Mike Yates, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for IDEX Corporation. Let me start by saying thank you for joining us for a discussion of the IDEX first quarter 2021 financial highlights. Last night, we issued a press release outlining our company\u2019s financial and operating performance for the 3 months ending March 31, 2021. The press release, along with the presentation slides to be used during today\u2019s webcast, can be accessed on our company\u2019s website at www.idexcorp.com. Joining me today is Eric Ashleman, our Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Grogan, our Chief Financial Officer. The format for our call today is as follows : we will begin with Eric providing an overview of the state of our business and update on our M&A activity and an overview of our order performance and outlook for our end market. Bill will then discuss our first quarter 2021 financial results and provide an update on our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2021. Finally, Eric will conclude with an update on our sustainability, diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Before we begin, a brief reminder, this call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the Safe Harbor language in last night\u2019s press release and in IDEX\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to our CEO, Eric Ashleman. Eric Ashleman : Thank you, Mike. Once again, our teams across the IDEX should be extremely proud of the results we\u2019ve achieved together. I don\u2019t think any of us would have imagined being at this point when viewing the state of the world a year ago. Our diverse array of high-performing businesses continues to serve as well. We\u2019re seeing most of our end markets either largely recovered or steadily improving at this point. We continue to build on the momentum we experienced in the fourth quarter and expect 2021 to be stronger than our expectations 90 days ago. Although, tremendous progress has been made in our recovery, there are still some areas we\u2019re keeping a close eye on. Our day rates have accelerated, but we have yet to see larger projects in our industrial sector moving forward. Customers are more confident in their outlook, but are now trying to balance the surge in demand with capacity to make larger investments. As for COVID the conditions vary widely around the world. In the UK and the United States, the vaccination rate has been remarkable of late. In China, much of life has been continuing as normal for many months now. The situation in Europe and India, where lockdowns and virus variants are still a serious issue, reminds us that we are not fully past the societal and economic impact that the pandemic has had on our businesses. The quarter was not without challenges from safety protocols and lockdowns to sporadic shortages of parts and materials to rapidly changing logistics hurdles and a variety of staffing challenges. This was far from smooth sailing. Recognizing all of that, I want to thank every IDEX employee on this call for their efforts in the past quarter. I\u2019m proud that our team successfully navigated many tough hurdles to achieve these results. The operational excellence of our teams continues to pay off. Pivoting a moment to capital deployment. With the closure of the ABEL Pumps transaction this quarter and the announcement of the Airtech acquisition last night covered in more detail in a moment, we have started off 2021 on a strong note. And we\u2019ll build on this momentum as we further invest in M&A capabilities. We recently allocated some of our most talented resources towards focused strategy and business development roles. And we engaged external expertise to expand our ability to identify, assess, win and successfully integrate new companies into IDEX. Our deal funnel is expanding as we look for more opportunities to acquire organizations that fit the IDEX style of competition. We think they both widen and deepen the moats around our best businesses, as well as established positions within new market niches with the capabilities of our teams will drive the most value for customers and shareholders. We are fortunate to have significant financial resources to deploy towards these efforts. Moving on to Slide 7. Yesterday, we announced our intent to acquire Airtech Vacuum group from EagleTree Capital for $470 million. Airtech engineers and manufactures high performance regenerative blowers, pneumatic valves, air compressors and vacuum pumps. Airtech had revenue of $85 million with EBITDA margin in the mid 30s range in 2020. It is a 16x trailing deal and a 15x deal including acquired tax benefits. Within the IDEX family of businesses, they compliment and expand upon the solutions provided by gas manufacturing, which produces fractional horsepower air moving products and systems that include air compressors, vacuum pumps, air motors and tank systems. While there is some overlaps in the solutions they provide, much of their techs product lines will be complimentary. They will remain separate businesses within IDEX, but we anticipate collaboration and synergies from each company with shared expertise leading to further innovation. This deal, which we expect to close in the second quarter will then create a $200 million pneumatics platform within our Health and Science Technology segment. Turning to our commercial results on Slide 8. The positive momentum in order trends continued in the first quarter, both compared to prior year and sequentially allowing us to build $59 million of backlog in the quarter. Most of our business units are at or approaching pre-pandemic levels. I\u2019ll go into more details in a minute. Organic orders in the quarter exceeded the first quarter of 2020 and were an all time high for us. Q1 orders were also up 4% organically versus Q1 of 2019. As we look across our segments, health and science technologies and fire and safety diversified products delivered strong organic order growth with fluid and metering technology slightly lagging. As growth rates in HST and FSDP began to naturally level off we expect FMT will drive additional growth through the return of project-based businesses in the energy and industrial markets in the second half of the year. These commercial results and the strength of our rebound highlight the resilience of our businesses and the critical importance of the solutions we provide to our customers. On Slide 9, we provide a deeper outlook for our primary end markets. To level set, we entered the year cautiously bullish about the state of our underlying markets and the velocity of the pandemic recovery. Our day rate businesses began to accelerate coming into the year and we continued to leverage our diversified portfolio to aggressively pursue opportunities to drive organic growth coming out of the pandemic. We are now measuring our markets against their pre-pandemic levels. Many of our markets have fully recovered and the majority of our markets are on track to have fully recovered by the end of the year. As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re not out of the woods yet, but even with pockets of concern around supply chain disruptions and COVID in certain geographies, we are optimistic about the outlook of our end markets. In our Fluid and Metering Technology segment, industrial day rates continue to increase throughout the quarter. As I\u2019ve mentioned, we will not be at full recovery until we see large CapEx projects resume, but the underlying industrial markets are in a state of recovery trending back towards 2019 levels. Agriculture continues to drive outsized growth as crop prices and customer sentiment remains strong. Our Water business is stable. We continue to assess any subsequent impact from the pandemic, municipal funding as well as tailwinds that might come out of an infrastructure bill. Energy markets continue to lag 2019 levels primarily due to limited capital investment in this sector. Moving to the Health and Science Technologies segment, we experienced solid growth across almost all of our markets. Semicon and food and pharma continued to outperform, driven by a strong market and winning share with our differentiated technology offerings. The overall automotive market faces many challenges, but we have won several new platforms driving our performance. Our AI and life science markets are on the rebound, as the impact of the pandemic of the United States has improved. The industrial businesses within the segment are seeing a similar result to FMT. Day rates are improving but projects are lacking. One last item for HST, we do see risk with the COVID opportunities we have been talking about in this segment specifically around testing. The end product application is yet to receive FDA approval, which will impact volumes for this year. We do believe that the strength in the rest of the segment will be able to offset most of that risk. Finally, in our Fire & Safety/Diversified Products segment dispensing continues its rebound as large retailers free up capital and work through pent-up demand for equipment. Much like our automotive exposures in HST, the auto recovery in FSD at BAND-IT is driven by new platform wins coupled with an improved market. In Fire & Rescue, we continue to assess municipal budget headwinds, especially in Europe and India, as budgets have not been released delaying tenders. The U.S. market has been better, and we are optimistic about the impact of our businesses from increased infrastructure spending. The other lagging category in FSD is primarily BAND-IT\u2019s energy and aerospace exposure, along with some industrial applications in Fire & Rescue. We continue to closely monitor market conditions and are focused on ensuring the stability of our supply chain, as persistence in global supply chain issues threatened to create choppiness in the back half of the year. Despite these factors, we are confident enough in our outlook to raise our organic growth expectations for the year. With that, I would like to turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results for the quarter and full year. Bill Grogan : Thanks, Eric. I\u2019ll start with our consolidated financial results on Slide 11. Q1 orders of $711 million were up 10% overall and up 6% organically, as we built $59 million of backlog in the quarter. Organic orders grew sequentially and year-over-year in each of our segments as highlighted by Eric on the prior slide. First quarter sales of $652 million were up 10% overall and 6% organically. We experienced growth across all our segments with over 75% of our business units increasing year-over-year. Strength in Semicon, food and pharma and dispensing were the notable highlights in the quarter. Q1 gross margin contracted 80 basis points to 44.9%, but it was up 110 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by the dilutive impact of acquisitions, inventory step-up associated with ABEL, mix and one-time inventory reserves. The inventory reserves were associated with our pandemic related electrostatic sprayer businesses now materializing at the rate we expected. Excluding acquisitions in the inventory reserves, gross margin would have been flat to prior year. First quarter operating margin was 23.9%, up 40 basis points compared to prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 24.3%, up 80 basis points compared to last year, driven by the increased volume and the impact of cost actions taken last year offset by the gross margin pressure I just mentioned. I will discuss the drivers of operating income in more detail on the following slide. Our Q1 effective tax rate was 22.6%, which was higher than the prior year ETR of 20%, due to a decrease in the excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. This drove a $0.05 headwind on EPS for the quarter. First quarter adjusted net income was $115 million resulting in adjusted EPS of $1.51, up $0.18 or 14% over prior year. Excluding the $0.05 tax headwind, adjusted EPS would have been up $0.23 or 17%. Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $95 million, up 32% compared to prior year and was 82% of adjusted net income. The strong performance was driven by higher earnings and the continued impact of our working capital initiatives. Moving on to Slide 12, as Eric mentioned, we entered the quarter cautiously optimistic about the pace of growth coming into 2021. We knew that we were structurally well positioned to take advantage of the improving market conditions from the cost actions and discretionary controls, we put in place last year. Adjusted operating income increased $18 million for the quarter compared to prior year. Our 6% organic growth contributed approximately $13 million flowing through at our prior year gross margin rate. The impact of previous discretionary cost controls contributed $5 million and we were able to net $4 million from price, productivity, partially offset by inflation. After accounting for $2 million of negative mix, our organic flow-through is extremely strong at 58%. Flow-through was then negatively impacted by the $3 million charge related to the inventory reserve, I discussed on the last slide and the dilutive impact of acquisitions and FX, getting to a reported flow-through of 32%. As we highlighted in prior calls, we expect to reinvest aggressively in the business to drive both organic and inorganic opportunities. We\u2019ve already started those investments and expect the associated costs when these initiatives will reduce our organic flow-through in subsequent quarters. With that, I would like to provide an update on our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2021. I\u2019m on Slide 13. For the second quarter, we are projecting EPS to range from $1.60 to $1.63 with organic revenue growth of 18% to 20%, and operating margins of approximately 24.5%. The second quarter effective tax rate is expected to be about 23% and we expect a 2% top line benefit from the impact of FX. Corporate costs in the second quarter expected to be around $21 million with the increase, primarily driven by the M&A investments we discussed earlier. Turning to the full year outlook, we are increasing our full-year EPS guidance from $5.65 to $5.95, up to $6.05 to $6.20. We are also increasing our full year organic revenue growth from 6% to 8% up to 9% to 10%. We expect operating margins of approximately 24.5%. We expect FX to provide a 1% benefit to top line results. Our full year effective tax rate is expected to be around 23%. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be around $55 million. Free cash flow is now expected to be 115% to 120% of net income and corporate costs are expected to be approximately $74 million for the full year. Finally, our earnings guidance excludes any costs or earnings associated with future acquisitions or restructuring charges. ABEL Pumps is now included in these estimates with the deal closed in the first quarter. Airtech is not included in these estimates. We will update our guidance accordingly once a deal closes. With that, I\u2019ll throw it back to Eric for some final thoughts. Eric Ashleman : Thanks, Bill. I\u2019m on the final slide, Slide 14. Before we open the call for questions, I\u2019d like to share an update on our ESG journey and the evolution of our company culture. We recently published our second corporate social responsibility report. This report is our first to adopt the Sustainable Accounting Standards Board sector standards also known SASB. We have increased our disclosures in key areas, including health and safety, diversity, and environmental impact. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Denise Cade, our General Counsel and her cross-functional team for their outstanding efforts to bring our hard work and commitments to light. Diversity equity inclusion continues to be a point of emphasis in our evolving company culture. Since we last met, an outside facilitator conducted anonymous focus groups with employees from around the world, from which we learned and we\u2019re able to begin developing more targeted goals for the company. We are currently planning training sessions for all leaders to help them understand and become comfortable, fostering dialogue on these important issues. We are addressing our talent management processes, including our assessment of existing talent and our consideration of new talent through recruiting to help ensure our processes are free from unconscious bias. And we are assessing our purchasing practice to expand our use of diverse suppliers. IDEX is a decentralized company with a diverse collection of businesses. Our superior economic model depends upon problem solving and decision making at the point of impact, closest to our customers. Our collective work within this important areas outlined in this report is an essential component of our next phase of business growth. With that, let me pause and turn it over to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Mike Halloran : Good morning, everyone. So let\u2019s just talk about what\u2019s embedded in guidance here, obviously, really strong first quarter. Second quarter guide seems where the uptick and guidance comes from between the first and the second quarter, maybe a little less movement in the back half of the year relative to prior expectations. So just kind of want to understand, what the trajectory you\u2019re thinking about through the year is? How you\u2019re viewing the recovery? How much of \u2013 what I just mentioned is true and what are some of the puts and takes you\u2019re thinking about, because obviously, the tone that you\u2019re striking is cautiously optimistic as you move in the back half of the year. And just want to make sure I have all those things balanced. Eric Ashleman : Yes. Well, thanks, Mike. I mean, look, it\u2019s \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s an interesting time, as I said, in the opening comments there. I mean, we\u2019ve got this broad-based momentum, which we feel really good about. And it\u2019s got these little chapters that lie over it, whether that\u2019s shutdowns, coming out of Christmas, terrible weather in Texas in February, supply chain stuff now and I think that\u2019s going to be the story as we go. And then that lays over the IDEX story, which always kind of had our second quarter as a high point for us. And so we see that momentum lining up nicely on our typically seasonally adjusted second quarter. And then the back half, I think that\u2019s going to be a story of \u2013 we\u2019ve got some projects and things that we know about on the inside that we feel good about. We think the momentum certainly will continue, but we would suspect we\u2019re still going to have a lot of these challenges out there that we\u2019ll have to navigate around. And of course, then I think the typical seasonal patterns that we see around summer shutdowns and things in Europe are embedded on top of that. So it\u2019s an interesting story with very broad-based support, early momentum, these kind of episodic challenges that we have to navigate around that we feel confident and we will. Mike Halloran : So on those challenges, supply chain, inflation price cost dynamics, maybe talk about how those are impacting you, when you think there\u2019s call it peak pain from your perspective on all these things hitting, with that, I mean, first quarter margins were obviously excellent. Second quarter implied still very good. So just talk about how you\u2019re managing effectively and you did a ton of work coming into this to prepare for a lot of these challenges. But I\u2019d certainly like to understand how it\u2019s impacting you and how it phases through the year? Eric Ashleman : Yes, sure. Well, like, this is where our model and our talent really helps us. I mean, we\u2019ve got a lot of local sourcing very close to where we produce, very close to where we sell. So we have a kind of an inherent advantage there. And we\u2019ve got really, really talented teams that used, frankly, a lot of the lessons of the year\u2019s worth of the severe acute phase of the pandemic to make some smart moves around supply chain to prepare us for this. That being said, I would say, on the inflationary front, it\u2019s kind of spotty for us. I mean, remember we\u2019re a little further down the food chain. We don\u2019t buy a lot of giant quantities of base material. We buy things that have been converted. So it does have a little bit of a lag for us. And so we see the same things others are seeing where we buy lots of metals. There\u2019s some inflationary pressure, electronics, few other places. But we\u2019re navigating around those. On the freight side, that\u2019s certainly a challenge both on the price, frankly, more on the availability side. We\u2019re no different than anybody else trying to find sea containers, trucking, trains, port facilities that have to unclog all of those things. Our model helps us. Our folks help us. I think, as we go further out, the inflationary pressure I actually think that\u2019s going to ramp up a bit for everybody. One of the things that you can still appreciate, I see it in our own businesses is today we still have a little bit of the benefit of our people are good scavengers. They\u2019ll go around and they\u2019ll find some things over here. Find some places over there. Take advantage of some inventory sell stock. Eventually, you kind of get back where you\u2019re right at the end of the factory. And then you\u2019re kind of dealing with what everybody else is. So we\u2019re planning for that. We\u2019re making all the moves that we need to. And certainly, of course, all of this for us, you can never tell this story without talking about price capture. And so we\u2019ve got these things aligned and as you suspect, we\u2019re always trying to manage that spread and taking advantage of the price capture side as we sell and then executing the heck out of a difficult environment on the backend to maintain that spread as we go. And doing it all with our customers at top of mind and considering, and remembering the lead time requirements that we have kind of where we fit the criticality of what we do. That\u2019s what drives all of it. Bill Grogan : Yes, Mike. So we were pretty comfortable relative to where we\u2019re sitting right now that we\u2019ve maintained our historical price cost spread. When we have seen some businesses, the inflation has ramped up here more quickly. They\u2019ve gone out proactively with incremental prices or surcharges to our customer. So our commercial teams are actively working with our supply chain teams to make sure that we have the ability to continue that spread as we progressed through the year. Mike Halloran : Thanks for the answers, guys. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. There were a couple products cited in the prepared remarks COVID related, that were looking like they were lagging in terms of initial expectations. I know last year that was part of an IDEX initiative. There were $25 million to $100 million potential revenue new COVID products. It sounds like this - two of these were in that bucket, the HST the COVID tester and the FMT, the electrostatic sprayer. So just give us an update those COVID related initiatives, how many not all are going to come through, I get that, but just where does that stand in terms of expectations? Eric Ashleman : Sure. So I\u2019ll kind of start back in the beginning and just walk this from high to low. I mean, we originally talked about that range pretty quickly that moved to about $60 million. That was split pretty evenly between 2020 and 2021. So now we\u2019re kind of talking about a $30 million bucket for this year and the two biggest components in there were the electrostatic sprayer application, which we talked about and you saw in the margin walk, I\u2019ll come back to that in a second. And then the COVID testing, the diagnostic application, which was always a little bit more backend loaded. And as you noted, and we noted in our remarks, we\u2019ve got some pressure points around both of those related frankly to the improving situation that we see across the globe in terms of vaccination rates and some other things. On the sprayer front, that literally is binary as some change in thought, a change in thought, that was part of the CDC guidelines around the need for standardization, not being as high as previously thought. At a time, pretty coincident with some of our launch planning. So as you\u2019d suspect, we\u2019ve taken a slightly different view of that business. I think it\u2019s a good product line. There are still plenty of places, a lot of it involved in transportation where that\u2019s still going to be an essential piece of it. But it\u2019s no doubt going to run out slower. I do want to pause just for a second though and point out the positive aspect of that. That was \u2013 it was one of our hardest hit businesses in terms of their core markets that rallied massively quickly put together a business and put together all this product and got it ready to frankly live our mission and try to make the world a better place. So we celebrate that one. And we\u2019re going to leverage that capability going forward. On the other side, on the testing front, it\u2019s a little bit more complex. We\u2019ve got some issues on FDA approvals with our partners and we have this backdrop of vaccinations and things rolling out across the world, but I must tell you. So I think, we\u2019re viewing that a little less favorably as we go forward again with an eye towards what happens in the back half. Now the world is still is not at the recommended level of surveillance testing, we\u2019re underneath it by more than half. And we still think this has a role to play, but we want to at least point out that, there\u2019s an impact of an improving world to a couple of these applications. But overall, couldn\u2019t be happier with how our teams responded and put together the solutions here. Deane Dray : All right. That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks for the update there. And look, we\u2019d much rather see you take these shots on goal because that\u2019s good initiative. And there\u2019s always some positives that will come out of it in terms of product development and other market opportunities. So appreciate all that. Second question, just \u2013 it\u2019s more for Bill, just in terms of expectations on incrementals for the balance of the year. And I really appreciate how you highlight the organic drop through to separate out. It was like the inventory reserve taken. So just the expectation here, both on reported incrementals and organic incrementals and what is baked in on guidance here? Bill Grogan : Yes. So maybe I\u2019ll speak to the organic. Obviously, really healthy, we look at core organic flow-through of 58%. I think relatively increasing guide, where we\u2019re at with our reinvestments discretionary cost add backs, that\u2019s probably going to moderate around the low 40%s as we progress through the second, third and fourth quarters, if we do the math, that\u2019s really, what\u2019s implied with the revised EPS guidance. Deane Dray : That\u2019s real helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions. Allison Poliniak : Hi guys. Good morning. Just want to go back to your comments on the industrials more on that big project focus. I just want to make sure I understand it. It sounds like it\u2019s \u2013 the first half still really slow, second half, you\u2019re getting some expectation that that could improve. Any color there. Is it sort of confidence from customers increasing, quality of inquiries, any color you can provide on that side? Eric Ashleman : Yes, absolutely. I mean, it\u2019s an important piece of the business, especially as we think about the rest of the year. I think actually the situation is changed there. The daily order rates, of course, we pointed to that momentum and that\u2019s a great sign. That\u2019s a great sign that the system\u2019s working and that the momentum is there. The project side, I think has shifted from one of confidence in a lack of belief in let\u2019s say, an improving outlook in the world and all of those things, that\u2019s actually quite favorable now. I think now it\u2019s actually caught up in a space -a zone of people just trying to execute it. And I look at my own businesses and see some of that same thing where some things larger projects, we\u2019ve been thinking about a lot of people that would have been moving those along are trying really, really hard to ship product, get things going, understanding that\u2019s on inventory, all of that. So as we engage with customers, particularly that right down that fairway of industrials with an FMT, this is the difference in tone. You see a lot of optimism, but you also see a lot of very, very busy people. And that\u2019s especially true of the nature of the kind of projects we have. These are kind of those medium term expansions of facilities and things like that. So we\u2019re pretty confident, very confident that those are going to come back. In some ways, we just need to get a little bit more space to work on them, continue to see the momentum that\u2019s already out there. And then the lines cross, and we think that\u2019s an important part of our story going forward. Allison Poliniak : Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then just next, M&A, it sounds like a pretty active pipeline, two deals so far. I guess, two things, one \u2013 how are you balancing that managerial capacity to handle some of these incoming properties with activity increasing. And then second is really around leverage, any change to sort of that comfort level. And if there\u2019s some, I would say more interesting opportunities that come along here. Just any thoughts there? Eric Ashleman : Yes. Great questions. Well, so a couple of things and \u2013 just capacity in general, as you\u2019ve seen in the comments for a couple of quarters here, we\u2019ve been building that all along. A lot of the optimization we\u2019ve done with IDEX over the last five years gave us the muscle that we\u2019re now leaning on as we think about looking for acquiring and integrating companies. So that\u2019s something just at the foundational level rather than just do the two transactions that we have here. They\u2019re both very good standalone businesses that while they\u2019re going to require some integrative activity these are well positioned, in good shape and let\u2019s say, a lighter touch in terms of demand from some IDEX talent across the board. And so bottom line is, I feel confident that we could continue to work the funnel that we have with the intent that we\u2019re driving. If we were to kind of lap this experience again in the back half, I wouldn\u2019t see that as a problem, in terms of \u2013 our teams being able to go out and work on acquisitions. I will tell you, it\u2019s a spec. We always filter these, there are some properties that if we said yes, and we were successful to take a lot more work than others. And we would factor that in. And we\u2019re always pretty aware of that. But right now in very good shape with an intentional build on the bottom side and on the top. Two transactions that are very fortunately are in kind of great shape out of the gate. Bill Grogan : And then relative to your second part of your question, I would say, yes, we still think our balance sheet is most efficient at about 2.5x. So relative to the capital availability we have on hand plus additional leverage for us to go deploy another $2 billion post the Airtech closure is extremely reasonable. So we have more than enough capacity to go after the things that Eric just mentioned. Allison Poliniak : Great. Thanks so much for the color. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Connor Lynagh : Yes, thank you. I wanted to talk about the Airtech acquisition. Just wondering, if you could sort of provide an overview of why you found this to be an attractive asset, how we should think about the market structure and the competitive positioning of the firm? Eric Ashleman : Sure. Well, this is an exciting transaction. This is a really, really phenomenal company. And it sits very nicely next to the gas business that we illustrated there on the opening deck. In the nature that they\u2019re both involved with very, very specialized air handling applications, but they\u2019re highly complementary. So the strengths of gas in different areas of compression are then balanced very nicely with the regenerative blower side and the specialty in the valve piece of Airtech. So they fit together seamlessly. What I really, really like about these businesses is they\u2019re both filled with incredible domain experts who have just got phenomenal abilities to innovate. Airtech has got a great growth track record. As I said in my opening comments, it\u2019s very profitable, very close to end markets that we\u2019re extremely interested in. On the gas side, we\u2019ve got some of that as well. And frankly we\u2019ve got a lot of channels strength in markets that I think are going to compliment that business. And then we\u2019ve got a toolkit. We\u2019ve got a talent base, a cultural base, and an 80-20 toolkit that we know when you apply to IDEX like businesses, particularly ones of high quality, can drive the whole thing further. Last piece of it is, there\u2019s other things out there in this world that could be interesting that the two businesses together may unlock for us that are part of our \u2013 the funnel and things that we\u2019re thinking about as we consider capital deployment in the future. So the suite of options, but around a - all of its centered around a super attractive business that we could not be happier with. Connor Lynagh : Yes. Understood. Maybe just to dive a little deeper on that. Could you help us understand sort of the big end markets that the business serves and just how you\u2019d think about longer term ex-COVID normalization type growth within the business? Eric Ashleman : Sure. I mean, the business has got it\u2019s \u2013 similar to gas in some respects, it\u2019s got kind of an industrial core that serves as a foundation piece both financially and in terms of scale. And then in the markets that they\u2019ve picked, they\u2019ve done some nice things in alternative energy. They\u2019ve done some great work within some specialty medical applications, some very interesting things around some technologies that are going to be important for the world going forward, industrial tech. They just, again, it\u2019s a lot like IDEX. Many of them are industrial like applications, but they really leverage being up at the tightest end of a tolerance and duty spectrum. And this business has a great filter in terms of how they bring those about. So, a lot of it\u2019s going to sum up to general industrial, but when you pick at it, that next level has always been the most important for us. And you just see incredible little niche applications that line up really well with their capabilities and the financials of the business. Connor Lynagh : Appreciate it. Eric Ashleman : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question. Matt Summerville : Thanks. A couple of questions. First, with respect to HST, it looked like that business delivered a pretty nice breakout performance from an operating margin standpoint. Can you talk about what\u2019s sort of driving that and how you feel about the sustainability in that profit performance that you delivered here in Q1? Bill Grogan : Yes, sure. I\u2019ll take the first stab at it and then Eric could add. No, I think relative to the actions that we took last year to restructure some of these assets and then the mix of the businesses within the portfolio that have performed extremely well here over the last couple of quarters. So that combination of a much better foundation to build off of, they did have significant growth and then the mix of sales within the different businesses were the primary drivers. So I\u2019d say, we would look for them to be at this level of profitability here going forward. Matt Summerville : Got it. And then just as a follow-up to the price cost sort of question that came up earlier. How much price were you guys able to realize in Q1? And how much incremental price realization will you need in the balance of the year to keep that price cost right where you want it? Thank you. Eric Ashleman : Well, we were just north of a point in Q1. That was fully in line with what we saw on the inbound side. I honestly think it will \u2013 we\u2019re going to aggressively target to ratchet that up a bit, but we always do that with the indicators that we see and thinking a lot about the ultimate spread that we realized. So I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve got a number of pegs, but we have a method that we peg that sort of is very active, follows along, takes advantage of the short lead times that we have in the way that we are able to execute price. So I guess, the shortest answer would be probably north of where we are here. A lot of it dependent on where we see some of the underlying commodities and some things heading for us, but always mindful of where that spread is. But ultimately we want to keep that as a net positive item for the company. Matt Summerville : Got it. Thank you, guys. Eric Ashleman : Thanks, Matt. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Giordano with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Francisco Amador : Hey guys. Good morning. This is Francisco on for Joe. Eric Ashleman : Hi. Francisco Amador : Are you guys seeing any impact specific to the semi-shortage, whether it\u2019s specifically on that end market or any other markets that are sort of feeling the pain like automotive? Eric Ashleman : Yes. We see them both fronts, so there are those occasions where end customers certainly got some issues, automotive is the easiest one to point to. That\u2019s the more recent coming into our world in the first quarter. We think about our exposure there is very much program by program. So it literally comes down to kind of, are they making trucks versus cars? And so we\u2019ve seen some of that enter the mix in Q1 and we talked about that. From our side, we don\u2019t have a ton of computerized elements of the products we make. We see it in sensors and some displays and some other places, so it\u2019s out there. And we\u2019re navigating just like everybody else, but it\u2019s been \u2013 frankly, we\u2019ve been able to move around it, work around it and bring it all together here. Francisco Amador : Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then can you expand a little bit more on the dispensing side? Are you seeing replenishment there and like just expanding on the demand in general? Eric Ashleman : Well, I think, yes, I think on the dispensing side, you see a couple of things coming together. I mean, one of the big drivers there has always been sort of life of the fleet and we were coming up at a point where that we knew that that was going to be refreshed. On top of that, of course, we had a pandemic where \u2013 frankly, even while we were locked down and shut down, there was a lot of painting going on and you saw a reluctance to say, well, let\u2019s go interrupt that stream with capital deployment. So now that we\u2019ve kind of passed through that, you\u2019ve got kind of those two things that coming together, and you\u2019ve got economies that are opening up on a global basis. Remember this is a really global business for us. We\u2019re doing business all over the world here. And so we\u2019re seeing kind of a bunch of positive forces come together all in one place on a business that has this potential over time. It does tend to hit some cycles and some valleys. And right now it\u2019s hitting many positive cycles. Francisco Amador : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Eric Ashleman : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Walter Liptak with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question. Walter Liptak : Hi. Thanks. Good morning and congratulations on the good quarter. I wanted to see if we can get some insight on the M&A pipeline with the Airtech deal. Was this a deal that you\u2019ve been working on for awhile? Clearly, there\u2019s a nice fit with gas and maybe a sector to go after. But was this a brokered deal? Was this something that was kind of went through a process or have you been working with Airtech for a while to try and get something going? Eric Ashleman : Yes. I mean, like a lot of the companies that are out here we\u2019ve known about Airtech for a long time. Honestly kind of watch them as they\u2019ve grown very, very well over the last half decade or so. So, they\u2019re under private ownership, a lot of things came together and I will tell you, it moved pretty quickly. In this particular case, this is \u2013 as you might imagine, one of the easier businesses for us to get our heads around. And then as we did that and saw the quality of it, it moves quite a bit faster than some other transactions, just because of a lot of those things lining up well for us. Walter Liptak : Okay, great. Thanks for that. And then, in the past, you guys have talked about the valuation multiples of M&A deals. I wonder, how\u2019d you feel about the multiple that you\u2019ll be paying for this one. And you mentioned 80-20 is like a value-add that you can bring to the business. Is it too early to start talking about where you think \u2013 what you think you could do with it? Eric Ashleman : Well, look it\u2019s very strong business, valuations are high now. We\u2019re pleased with the transaction. That\u2019s why we did it. I\u2019d say, from an 80-20 perspective, it\u2019s interesting. This \u2013 in any ways I think it\u2019s going to \u2013 this is representative of the sweet spot of what 80-20 can do. You\u2019ve got a business here that\u2019s a lot like ours in terms of its filled with these incredible problem solvers full of passion. What 80-20 helps you do is just understand what are the things you\u2019re going to go after? Why is that? And how can you get disproportionately more of your resources over on the things that are the best? It\u2019s a very simple framework and a thinking process that becomes intuitive over time. And we\u2019re excited to introduce it and work with Airtech team on how it might help them improve an otherwise already good business. You can use it for other things and different businesses that are in different states, but this one is very much around continuing to help a really strong business grow even better in the future. And think about \u2013 and use it as a lens to think about the combinations and synergistic elements between the two companies together. Bill Grogan : Relative to the multiple, obviously, we focus on the returns and this is a high quality business that we think is going to be drive returns well in excess of our cost of capital here as we proceed over the next couple of years. So, although it\u2019s a little bit on the higher side on the print number, long-term this is a phenomenal transaction for us. Walter Liptak : Okay. Yes, looks great. Thank you. Eric Ashleman : Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Rosenblatt Securities. Please proceed with your question. Scott Graham : Good morning and nice quarter for you guys. Thanks for taking my question. I apologize, I was sort of jumped on and off the call here. If I ask a question that\u2019s been asked, I apologize in advance. Did you mention Airtech\u2019s sales specifically? Eric Ashleman : Yes. We did in the opening comments around $85 million. Scott Graham : $85 million. Thank you. Additionally, Eric, I noticed that you put in your market sum up life sciences, is sort of recovering. And I know a couple of companies that are out there, be it Illumina, Danaher, which are proxies [Indiscernible] customer, but really had blowout first quarter results in some of their markets. And I know it\u2019s not perfectly like for like, particularly with Danaher, but I was just curious as to why you have that in recovering as opposed to not recovered. Eric Ashleman : Well, a couple of things, like a lot of things with IDEX it comes down to where we play and the products that we have there. So, a lot of companies have a lot more consumable exposure than we do. And so that would be very clearly that\u2019s the piece that recovers first and a lot of the elements that are embedded in life sciences. Let\u2019s just take the kind of classic IBD space, as things open up and people go back in for testing you get a lot of action on the consumable stream, but it takes a while before you\u2019re going to do a large scale box replacement and that\u2019s what we supply. So, we\u2019ve got a mixed bag here. We\u2019ve got some places like that where we\u2019re going to have to wait. And we certainly have some exciting stuff, especially on the microfluidics side and some of the stuff around AI as it involves itself in vaccine development and therapeutics [get up] (ph) in a different place. But when you put it all together we sort of use this category to say, recovering, but not quite there yet. And we understand the elements that are going to have to find their way in there for us to move it into the next space. Scott Graham : Right. I guess, by just a little bit different space of things then move around within the space, would you be surprised if on the next quarter call that if you didn\u2019t have life sciences up a notch into the recovered zone? Eric Ashleman : I\u2019d certainly consider the arrow to be moving in that direction. A lot of it would come down to the IBD placement of machines, some of the CapEx that\u2019s in that product, whether that\u2019s a quarter from now or later, I don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s hard to imagine that it wouldn\u2019t improve. All the dynamics would suggest that we would follow much of what you cited there and those other companies. Scott Graham : Got you. Okay. Yes. Thank you. So another question again on that same page Fire and Rescue. This morning one of your customers reported a pretty robust fire number, which surprised me, might have even surprised you. I know that, sort of muni spending and related was a bit of an area that you were watching coming into the quarter. It sounds like you kind of still are. Could you update us a little bit on that market? Is there potentially may be a refresh that\u2019s needed there as well, given the number that customer reported this morning? Or is that maybe just sort of like \u2013 sort of like the final good quarter and maybe you think it slows down from here, just on Fire. Eric Ashleman : Yes. Well, I certainly couldn\u2019t talk too much about what they said or what they might be seeing, but I will say it\u2019s an interesting space because you have a lot of things going on here. You\u2019ve got obviously the municipal spend profile side and a lot of that we\u2019re going to have to wait and see where that goes. There are so many elements that are moving around concurrently. There\u2019s federal efforts to backstop things and that side of it there\u2019s some regulatory pieces. So we\u2019ll see. And then you\u2019ve got this dynamic, certainly in this market where we\u2019ve seen even ahead of some of the more recent supply chain stuff that we\u2019re talking about globally, very unique to that industry, challenge around trucks and chassis and things that\u2019s sort of capped off some of the potential on the sales side for end customers. So, if that works itself out that\u2019s going to be ultimately good for us. We\u2019ll see how successful people are with that. And then we\u2019ll have to see where the market itself, the municipal market rides along underneath it. And then you always have to throw in for us, I hate to do add more and more variable, but this is a really massively global business. And so, they don\u2019t all move in step. Things going on in China and India and emerging markets are not necessarily the same as what we would see here in the Midwest. So there\u2019s a lot of things working together. I think it\u2019s safe to put it in the recovering. It is improved, not quite back where we would expect it to be and think it will be ultimately. And then we will like you monitor a lot of these things coming together here to paint a clear picture as we go. Scott Graham : That\u2019s very clear, Eric. Thank you. Eric Ashleman : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Nathaniel Pendleton : This is Nate on for Nathan Jones this morning. I wanted to ask about orders. Orders were up 6% organically and 10% in total. Can you talk about kind of the cadence of orders through the quarter? What segments and end markets drove the improvement in order rates? And then how daily order rates are trending so far in April. Eric Ashleman : Yes. I mean, honestly you can kind of take the entire company and say in generally it improved as we moved through that first quarter. I will remind us again each month had its own chapter of externality. But I guess all of them were somewhat equal. So broad improvement kind of marching through the quarter and as we\u2019re looking at April, I mean, I don\u2019t see anything that would change the story here. Bill, anything you\u2019d add. Bill Grogan : No. I guess, from what drove the orders, obviously all of the businesses within HST did extremely well. Within FMT, obviously we talked about that\u2019s probably the group that\u2019s still lagging a bit across the portfolio, outside of Banjo that had a phenomenal quarter and it continues to outperform relative to the dynamics in that market. And then within FSD, Band-IT and dispensing specifically did extremely well with Fire and Rescue improving relative to some of the things that Eric highlighted based on Scott\u2019s question, so a little bit slower than the balance of the portfolio. Nathaniel Pendleton : Okay, great. And I wanted to ask a follow-up with muni. What are your assumptions on muni budgets and spending? And then what are your thoughts on the infrastructure spending Bill and potential impact to the muni market? Eric Ashleman : Yes. So look, I think we\u2019ve got muni spending in generally in kind of a steady as she goes category until we know more and see it. The infrastructure stuff is interesting as you\u2019d expect probably like everybody else, you kind of go and peel it back headline by headline. Then you\u2019ve got to really work on a variable of timing. Like when do we think that that would find its way here? And as always, a lot of it\u2019s pretty unclear. So just that term in itself, if it means roads and bridges, it means one thing for IDEX, if it means underneath and sewers and wet pipe and things like that, that\u2019s different. And it\u2019s hard for me to see how clear it is until it starts to become more actionable, which then I think supports \u2013 I think it\u2019s going to take a while to run out. But I would say in general, the fact that it exists is a positive element that should help of many IDEX markets. So we view it that way. We\u2019ll continue to ping it as we get some insight into things and start to see driving trends within the business will surely call it out. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thank you for taking my questions. Eric Ashleman : Sure. Operator : There are no further questions in the queue. I\u2019d like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks. Eric Ashleman : Okay. Thanks so much. For those external to IDEX, I always want to thank you for your support and interest in the company. We know there\u2019s a lot of IDEX employees on a call like this as well. And so frankly, I want to thank you again for your hard work. It\u2019s paying off clearly, as we\u2019ve talked about here. There\u2019s more hard work to come, but we\u2019ve got a resilient business. I think our positioning in these attractive niches continues to serve us well. We\u2019ve got a team of people that are second to none here. So I think you can hear, we\u2019re pretty optimistic about the path forward. We know there will be challenges, things that are unexpected that will come up along the way, but we\u2019re excited. We\u2019re excited about the momentum that we\u2019re seeing, where it will take us. And we\u2019re very excited about the story here with bringing Airtech into the IDEX family, alongside ABEL Pumps. We\u2019re working hard to continue that momentum as well on top of it as we go forward. And we\u2019ll look forward to talking to you all along the way as we make progress. Thanks so much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Michael Yates, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer. Thank you, you may begin. Michael Yates : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. This is Mike Yates, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for IDEX Corporation. Let me start by saying thank you for joining us for a discussion of the IDEX second quarter 2021 financial highlights. Last night we issued a press release outlining our company's financial and operating performance for three months ending June 30, 2021. The press release along with the presentation slides we use during today's webcast can be accessed on our company's website at www.idexcorp.com. Joining me today is Eric Ashleman, our Chief Executive Officer and Bill Grogan, our Chief Financial Officer. The format for our call today is as follows. We will begin with Eric providing an overview of the state of IDEX's business and update on our growth investments and an overview of our order performance and outlook for our end market. Bill will then discuss our second quarter 2021 financial results and provide an update on our outlook for third quarter and full year 2021. Finally, Eric will conclude with updates on our sustainability and diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your question. If you should need to exit the call for any reason, you may access to complete replay beginning approximately two hours after the call concludes by dialing the toll-free number 877-660-6853 and entering Conference ID number 13712090. Or you may simply log on to our company's homepage for a webcast replay. Before we begin, a brief reminder. This call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the Safe Harbor language in last night's press release and in IDEX's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I'll now turn this call over to our CEO, Eric Ashleman. Eric Ashleman : Thank you, Mike. Beginning with our overview on Slide 6. The past year and a half have been among the most dynamic and unpredictable ever experienced, but our IDEX team stepped up again in Q2 and delivered during an extremely challenging environment. Thank you to the IDEX employees around the world who are working so hard. Our Commercial performance is very strong as we record and record orders and backlog in the quarter. Order trends continue to improve sequentially in all three segments and materially above pre pandemic level. Our day rates are very strong and our OEM order patterns are robust. Only large industrial projects, many of them in FMT continue to lag a bit. We're beginning to see the move into planning funnels indicating support for continued phases of organic growth in the back half of 2021 and next year. Our number one operating challenge for the quarter was supply chain and logistics disruptions. IDEX is generally a short cycle business with quick lead times. We typically operate at the component level further down our customers' bill of materials. We're also now very vertically integrated. We depend on a tight network of supplier partners, often located close by our operating units to quick turn our solutions with a minimum of visibility. These reasons the challenging conditions of tight material supply and bottleneck logistics tend to lag other industrial companies. Our agile model does support a quick calibration to today's realities and it helps us exit quicker than many on the backside of a supply side constraint. Overall, we believe these disruptions have hit a plateau. We don't see things getting worse and the challenges will continue to be highly variable. At the same time, we don't anticipate these disruptions getting better soon, but most likely they will not subside until the end of this year or early next year. We anticipated rising inflation as the global economy recovered, and like many did not imagine the sharp rate of increase. This narrowed our spread between price capture in material costs, although we remain positive overall. Our team's leverage the systematic investments we made a few years ago in pricing management and aggressively deployed two, sometimes three pricing adjustments with precision. We are on track to expand our price cost spread to typical levels as we travel to the back half of the year. While we spent a lot of time talking about our business's ability to capture price, one area I don't want to miss is our continued focus on operational productivity. Our teams continue to drive margin improvement through 80 :20 simplification, lean effort, and through sound CapEx deployment. Our robust project bundles continue to be another weapon to combat rising costs. One project that exactly exemplifies this spirit deserves mention as we discuss Q2. Our energy market, now starting to show some signs of recovery off the bottom are still lagging the overall group. Our teams are aggressively executing a facility rationalization project to consolidate our scale and focus our human resources in close working proximity. Ultimately, this is a long-term value driver for that group. But in the quarter, the project created headwinds for us as equipment was delayed, and inventory positions were less than ideal to support production transports. We expect the project to be back on track and completed by the end of the third quarter. Overall, I am confident in our path through these choppy recovery [ph] seats. We continue to apply relentless focus from outstanding teams to deliver solutions that matter from high quality businesses that are very well positioned within their application steps. Moving on to Slide 7. We deployed just over $575 million in the first half of the year with our acquisitions of ABEL Pumps, Airtech and a small investment in a digitalization technology startup within the Fire and Rescue space. We continue to build out processes and capabilities to explore additional strategic investments we want to make across IDEX. Our funnel for potential acquisitions stronger than it has been in the past. And we're more aggressive in pursuing opportunities that enhance our business solutions fit well with our style of competition and drive IDEX like returns. It's early days in our integration of ABEL and Airtech, but we're happy to see that each business is performing well with excellent growth prospects in the near and long term. While we've stepped up our M&A game, we're also investing in our existing businesses with a 45% increase in capital spending through the first half of the year. We're in the process of expanding IDEX facilities in China and India. We project significant ongoing growth opportunities across Asia. And these investments are critical to support our local-to-global approach as we move to the next level of competitive advantage. We're also focused on our digital strategy with our largest investments tied to our areas of higher integration and scale as we seek to drive higher impact for our customers. Lastly, as I mentioned previously, we're focused on operational productivity as market dynamics are changing, as well as investing in new technology to support growth. This is both the CapEx and OpEx side. Some of these investments are targeted at new applications in high growth areas, like components to enable new global broadband satellite networks, building batteries for electric vehicles, and providing key products to support the build out of incremental capacity in semiconductor manufacturing. These investments are combined with targeted spend in areas to support automation and efficiencies across the shop floor. This strategic approach to both inorganic and organic investment is already paying off and sets us up for ongoing success for years to come. Turning to our commercial results on Slide 8. As I mentioned, order strength continued in the second quarter, both compared to prior year and sequentially resulting in a backlog build of $65 million in the quarter as we look across our segments, all rebounded well from the pandemic and delivered strong organic order growth. Sequentially, Fluid and Metering Technologies and Fire and Safety Diversified Product saw increased orders compared to the first quarter. Our Health and Science Technologies segment also saw increased sequential orders if we exclude the impact of a COVID testing application debugging that occurred in Q2. Order intake across all segments was also above second quarter 2019 levels. FMT lags, HST and FSD, due to lower levels of investment in the oil and gas market, as well as its concentration in the industrial market, which saw a pre COVID pullback in the second half of 2019. These commercial results give us confidence in our ability to deliver double-digit growth in the second half of the year and continue to highlight the resilience of our businesses and the criticality of our solutions to customers. On Slide 9, we provide a deeper look into our primary end market. Our focus is shifting from recovery to growth as most of our businesses are now performing above pre pandemic level, even with pockets of concern around supply chain disruptions and COVID in certain geographies, we're optimistic about the outlook of our markets and our ability to execute within them. In our Fluid and Metering Technologies segment, industrial day rates were strong. Supply chain challenges remained, but overall, the market trajectory was at or above 2019 levels, with only large projects lagging as I mentioned earlier. Agriculture continued to drive strong growth driven by aging farm equipment and record crop prices. Our Water business was stable. We continue to monitor the impact of the Federal Infrastructure Package and U.S. municipal spending, energy and chemical markets continue to trail 2019 levels, primarily due to limited capital investment in the sector, as well as a longer project close cycle. One item to highlight for FMT is the impact of our FMD acquisition last year. It's now in our organic figures and with its backlog burn last year and significant pullback in customer's capital investments, it impacted FMT's organic sales by 11%. In other words, FMT's organic sales for the quarter would have been 19% instead of 8%. Moving to the Health and Science Technologies segment, we're seeing recovery activity growth across all our end markets. [Indiscernible] continue to perform well driven by strong market demand and winning share into our targeted growth initiatives. The overall automotive market continued to face supply chain driven challenges, but we outperform the market due to our product concentration and higher end European vehicles. Our AI and Life Science market continue to perform well as the pandemic impact ease and investments have increased. The industrial business within the segment saw a similar result to FMT. Finally, in our Fire and Safety Diversified Products segment, dispensing rebounded as large retailers freed up capital and work through pent up demand for equipment. Abandoned business was adversely affected by U.S. automotive production pullbacks due to microprocessor shortages in the second quarter. However, we continue to achieve new platform wins and believe we're well positioned to outperform the market as supply chain constraints ease. In Fire and Rescue, we have yet to see larger tenders come back and emerging markets remained slow. We continue to closely monitor market conditions and expect some choppiness in the second half of the year. That said, we're confident in the future trajectory of our end markets as well as our ability to execute on our strong backlog, and have raised our organic growth expectation for the year. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results. Bill Grogan : Thanks, Eric. I will start with our consolidated financial results on Slide 11. Q2 orders of $751 million were up 44% overall, and 39% organically, as we build $65 million of backlog in the quarter. Organic orders grew sequentially and year-over-year in each of our segments, as highlighted by Eric on the prior slide. Second quarter sales of $686 million were up 22% overall, and 17% organically. While we experienced a strong rebound from the pandemic across our portfolio, we were impacted by supply chain constraints and our energy side consolidation which tempered our results. The FMT pressure in Fluid and Metering Eric discussed also had an impact on overall organic sales. Excluding FMT, organic sales would have been up 22%. Q2 gross margin expanded by 280 basis points to 44.6%. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by increased volume and price capture, partly offset by inflation and supply chain impacts. Excluding the impact of $1.8 million pretax fair value inventory step up charges related to the ABEL acquisition adjusted gross margin was 44.9% and was approximately flat sequentially. Second quarter operating margin was 23.1% up 340 basis points compared to prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 24.4% up 330 basis points compared to prior year, largely driven by gross margin expansion and fixed costs leverage offset by a rebound in discretionary spending and investment. I will discuss the drivers of operating income in more detail on the next slide. Our Q2 effective tax rate was 21.3%, which was lower than the prior year ETR of 22.7% due to benefits from foreign sourced income in the second quarter of 2021. This benefit also drove favorability to our guided rate for the quarter. Q2 adjusted net income was $123 million resulting in adjusted EPS of $1.61 up $0.51 or 46% over prior year adjusted ETR. Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $120 million down 25% compared to prior year and was 98% of adjusted net income. This result was impacted by a volume driven working capital build higher CapEx and timing of tax payment partially offset by higher earnings. Our working capital efficiency metrics remain strong and the teams continue to do a good job managing the significant volume changes year-over-year. Moving on to Slide 12, which details the drivers of our adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income increased $49 million for the quarter compared to prior year. Our 17% organic growth contributed approximately $41 million flowing through at our prior year gross margin rate. We maintained positive price material cost within the quarter and leveraged well on the volume increase. Our high contribution margins helped mitigate the profit headwinds we experienced from the supply chain disruptions. In the second quarter of 2020, discretionary spending and investment were minimal, driven by a strict cost control environment during the pandemic. As we returned to a spend level in line with our growth and continued strategic investments, we see year-over-year pressure of about $11 million in line with the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year. Even with the incremental spend, supply chain and operational issues that tempered our performance, we still achieved a robust 45% organic flow through. Flow throughs then negatively impacted by the dilutive impact of acquisitions and FX getting us to our reported flow through of 39%. As we highlighted, we expect to reinvest aggressively in the business to drive both organic and inorganic opportunities. We expect that our level of discretionary spending, as well as associated costs from growth initiatives will similarly reduce organic flow through in subsequent quarters. With that, I would like to provide an update on our outlook for the third quarter and full year. Moving on to Slide 13. For the third quarter, we're projecting EPS to range from $1.57 to $1.61. We expect organic revenue growth of 14% to 16% and operating margins of approximately 24.5%. The third quarter effective tax rate is expected to be 23%. And we expect a 1% top line benefit from the impact of FX. And corporate costs in the third quarter are expected to be around $21 million. Turning to the full year. We are increasing our full year EPS guidance from our previous range of $6.05 to $6.20 up to $6.26 to $6.36. This range includes Airtech, which will contribute $0.06 in the second half of 2021, roughly $0.03 a quarter. We are also increasing our full year organic revenue growth from 9% to 10% up to 11% to 12%. We expect operating margins of approximately 24.5%. We expect FX to provide a 2% benefit to top line results. The full year effective tax rate is expected to be around 23%. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be around $65 million, an increase of around $10 million versus our last call as we increase our investments in growth opportunities. Free cash flow is expected to be 110% to 115% of net income lower versus our last guide primarily due to the additional capital spending and higher working capital support our increased volume. And corporate costs are expected to be approximately $77 million for the year. Finally, our earnings guidance excludes any costs, earnings associated with future acquisitions or restructuring charges. With that, I'll throw back to Eric for some final thoughts. Eric Ashleman : Thanks, Bill. I'm on the final slide, Slide 14. Before we open the call up to questions, I'd like to share an update on our [ph] ESD journey and the evolution of our company culture. I pledged earlier this year that we would hire a new Chief Diversity Equity and Inclusion Officer. I'm pleased to announce that I now have Troy McIntosh on my senior leadership team. He joined us just last week from U.S. Cellular, the fourth largest cellular communications carrier in the United States, where he led significant improvements in their culture and levels of diversity in the workforce. At IDEX, Troy will help build the global roadmap and success measures for DE&I. He will help embed DE&I deeper in our culture and build inclusive leadership competence and capabilities in all our people through training, education and coaching. He will help us make sure our systems mitigate bias and create opportunities for everyone, no matter their background to reach their full potential at IDEX. I look forward to great things happening with his leadership. I'd also like to share a nice step we're taking to improve our energy efficiency. Work recently began on a solar array on the roof of our LUKAS manufacturing facility in Germany. Once completed next month, this collection of solar panels will be about one-third the size of the European soccer field and provide 30% of the electricity needs for the facility. Not only will it help reduce our carbon footprint there, we estimate it will save the business more than \u20ac67,000 in just the first year alone. We anticipate this project will serve as a pilot leading the way for other solar installations on IDEX facilities around the world. Lastly, I want to share the catastrophic flooding the devastated portions of Western Europe earlier this month has impacted many IDEX employees. About a quarter of the employees that are German Fire and Safety business Vetter have either had their home severely damaged or destroyed. All of our employees are safe living with friends and family as recovery efforts are ongoing and operation continued at our Vetter facility, which is not directly impacted by the flood. Amid all this destruction and loss, once again we saw the spirit of IDEX come through. Colleagues from other IDEX businesses in Germany came to the area to assist with pumping equipment from our businesses. Our people work tirelessly to help draw water from flooded homes to the long road to recovery by then. The IDEX Foundation also gave 100,000 to the German Red Cross, which is thousands of people in the region assisting those impacted. While I shared this internally, I want to again express with our employees at Vetter that we stand by you through this terrible tragedy. And thank you to all the dedicated and selfless IDEX colleagues who dropped everything and volunteered during this time in need. Your outstanding examples what makes this company so special. With that, let me pause and turn it over to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Eric Ashleman : Morning Deane. Bill Grogan : Hi, Deane. Deane Dray : Already, maybe we can start with Eric early comment in the prepared remarks. And I know you touched so many end markets and within the diverse product line. But what are the indicators you're looking at that suggests that the supply chain disruptions have peaked to kind of your degree of confidence? And the reason I'm also asking is like we heard yesterday from GE and 3M. And neither of them sounded as confident that the worst had passed. But you're sounding a bit or noticeably more optimistic, Eric. So maybe we're going to start there thing. Thanks. Eric Ashleman : Sure, Deane. I guess all of this is somewhat relative at this point. I mean, this - make no mistake, this is really, really tough right now. And so, staying at steady state of tough is what it is. I don't want to mischaracterize it there. For us, a couple of things to remember, we're a little less exposed to a lot of the electronics, microprocessor things that other businesses are. Our building material is generally a little bit more streamlined and simplified. So, we don't have as many aggregations or complex systems, we do a lot of great critical components. And we still, we have a lot of suppliers that are pretty close by that, honestly, we drive by on the way to work. That being said, still very difficult for us. The indicators we're looking at, things like lead time, what are the quarter's lead times and then what is the performance against them and like they have lengthened and extended, but they're generally kind of holding at this point. And the delivery rates against them, while not great are at least in our world, pretty stable at this point. So, I just want to emphasize the relative nature of the comments and say, for us, it's very, very tough environment, but we see it, the one we can now begin to plan around, given what we do. Deane Dray : That's real helpful. And if we can stay, like more of a real time analysis here, if we could, commentary about your day rates would be helpful. And the mix still not seeing kind of larger projects yet, but maybe there's some front log discussions that you could share and any commentary about how July has started. Thanks. Eric Ashleman : Sure. So, if we kind of go back to the end of 2020, we saw - most of the acceleration that we're seeing was in that restoration of industrial day rates in our businesses. And as we look at the second quarter and even into the first days in July, pretty stable at this point. I mean, it's kind of at a healthy clip, we'll see it move on in terms of price and some things that come up and it's not accelerating at the same rate. More is it in our world, decelerating, think of it as stable. And then there's two other components that we think a lot about for a ton of IDEX businesses. And they're in the project category, but they're different degrees in terms of size and scope. So, what we are seeing and what's contributing to growth, and I know will continue into Q3 and Q4, we would call lots of small projects. These are discrete things where people are optimizing the system. Instead of asking for one or two, it's something at 10 to 20. And they're running their factory or their production lines, but they're trying to optimize it, enhance throughput, get productivity, those are the kind of things you can do on the run. And so, we're seeing that those have been strong contributors. And we think they'll continue. Right past it, are the classic larger projects that we and others play with. A lot of them in kind of the chemical, oil and gas, infrastructure spaces. And there's just a general story there are still where those things are delayed. They were frozen in 2020. They were pushed out into 2021, not canceled. I will say what we're starting to hear now, and mainly from distributors that are a little closer to the frontlines are that those are now starting to turn into quote, activity, inspect transfer and the kind of things you start to see ahead of an order and a replenishment cycle on our side. When does that happen? Maybe there's some of it in the back half of the year. Certainly, at a minimum, we start talking about it more in planning, and I think it bodes well for the early part of 2022. Deane Dray : Great. That was exactly the color we were looking for. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Mike Halloran : Hey, good morning, everyone. Just an update in how you're thinking about the M&A environment, your pipeline and how you're thinking about actionability of that pipeline today. I know you've got a fair amount of capacity still sitting in front of you. And just curious how actionable you think that is in the short to medium term here? Bill Grogan : Sure, sure. Well, I mean, I kind of do it upside down, maybe the availability side is really, really good. I mean, we could go through the specific numbers, but we got plenty of availability and firepower to spend. On the inside, we've been talking now for a couple of quarters about the intentionality of the resource bill. And the time and effort we're taking to consider all of the areas where we'd like to do more business, some of it through inorganic efforts, think of this as a series of concentric circles, radiating around places where we participate today and participate. And a few things, we're actually thinking of some zones where we're not part, not currently part of IDEX. That could be interesting to have IDEX like attribute. So, we've got the firepower, we're doing more work, and then the funnel of things that we're looking at is very active, aggressive. And I think in the end, actionable. Now, we still are going to take the same discipline that we've had to any of the things that we're looking at, it's got to meet certain requirements, got to fit into IDEX, got to leverage what we do best. But I'll tell you that we're looking at more things than we have before and probably more areas than we have previously with more people involved and lots of firepower to get the work done. Mike Halloran : So, on that point there more areas and maybe you previously looked. I'm guessing it's not really a change in the strategy nor maybe just more iterative in broadening, maybe some high level thoughts on what that changes and areas that you might be thinking of loosely? Bill Grogan : Yeah, I like this analogy, and I used it a second ago. I really think about it is radiating concentric circles. So, there's an anchor position generally in work that we're doing today, whether it's in the fluidic space, some of the stuff in life sciences. But I think we're willing to extend outward a little bit in terms of what's the solution that we will bring to our customer set. And so, that's maybe the area of difference or slight tweaks to the model. We've always, I mean, we've mentioned an open aperture for at least a couple of years now, at least, an open mind to some things that might be very interesting as we long considered for IDEX. I don't know that that's different. That's always been on the page. But these have been the two areas that there's a separate resource base thinking about little further out from what we've done before, but still anchored to how we do it. And a couple of zones that have always been interesting to us, because they have IDEX like attribute. Mike Halloran : Makes sense. And it's probably a question with Deane, he talked about some of these businesses feeling better about those as they track towards '22. Maybe just high level, how are you thinking broadly about all the puts and takes you're seeing in the portfolio now, and what that means once you hit a more normalized run rate, orders, record levels? You're seeing some normalization margin, or at least with the pressures from a price cost perspective can look like as you move through the year. The timing of some of these later cycle things starts getting a little bit better as you move through this year, maybe late and early next year, you can start seeing a little bit more CapEx. Just how does that all kind of come together when you're thinking about that one-to-two-year outlook from your seat? And what do you think the constraints are on top of that? Bill Grogan : Yeah, sure. So, I think it's a great question. And I like the way you phrased it. If you start from the highest level and think about the next couple of years, I think you start with a very positive perspective. You recognize that, like we're now coming through a pretty acute recovery cycle that isn't completely played out. Then there's a replenishment cycle that not only I think is reflective of the time that we sort of were all locked away. But I think even ahead of that, there was a decent amount of industrial capacity that needs to be put back into the system. The real question, I think, as we go is, if you think of this as a series of graph lines with very sharp peaks and troughs, and this is super dynamic, in terms of the elements we're dealing with today, is they smooth out and look a little bit more like the Appalachians. I think that that becomes a little bit more of a standard operating environment with positive momentum. And so, many of the dynamics that we're talking about now in terms of when they come back or when they reoccurred, I think they would be in place and they would be things that we'd be typically used for looking at. And it would feel a little bit normalized, in terms of the way that we would operate with favorable winds that are backed in all of the places that we play. So, I think we view it that way, we're planning for it that way. But it's a positive outlook and positive framework, you just sort of have to navigate some of the puts and takes and there's a lot of dynamic variables here, none of which I think really get in the way of that positive outlook. Eric Ashleman : And I think the economics associated with that growth would very much look like our traditional profile will leverage extremely well some of the facility consolidations that we're executing on this year will be foundational, some of that margin improvement. And then two, just as we've proven here, as we progress through the year, the team's ability to go out and capture incremental price to deal with some of the supply chain issues and rising inflation, there'll be bedrock as we go forward if that inflationary environment continues on for a couple more quarters. Mike Halloran : Appreciate gentlemen, thank you. Eric Ashleman : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Allison Poliniak : Hi, guys. Good morning. I just wanted to turn to the incremental. I know, Bill you had mentioned from a corporate perspective that discretionary and reinvestment, we're going to step up a bit here, which makes sense. But are there any notable changes as we kind of think across the segments? I know each segment has its own specific challenges that might be altered sort of in the near term, as we think about the back half? Bill Grogan : No. I mean outside of FMT, and there's two things I think we highlighted within the quarter one, some of the challenges we had with our facility consolidation and energy, and then just the year-over-year comp for FMT and the pressure that's putting on FMTs margin, last year they were at record backlog levels and at some really large projects so the second and third quarter that'll weigh more on FMT's margins year-over-year. But outside of that, the other two segments should perform pretty consistently with how they've done in the first half of the year. Allison Poliniak : Got it. And then just want to just confirm again the price cost spreads. You said it was a little bit compressed near term, which makes sense. Do we assume that we exit '21 with I would say what is a more normalized spread for you guys there? Bill Grogan : Yeah exactly. Eric Ashleman : Yep. Allison Poliniak : Perfect. Thank you. Eric Ashleman : Thanks, Allison. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Nathan Jones : Morning everyone. Eric Ashleman : Hi, Nathan. Nathan Jones : I want to just follow up on flow MD, obviously had a pretty big impact in the quarter. Can you maybe just give us a little bit more color on recent order trends, recent backlog trends there, when you think that will switch from being a drag to being a tailwind as that business returns to some growth? Eric Ashleman : Sure, I mean, that's, it's like, it's a tough story for that business. They had - they were burning backlog nicely, sort of right at the point of acquisition. Then, of course, COVID came along and devastated a lot of the core markets there. And it's a little bit more project intensive than the average IDEX business, just by the nature of what they do. These are large units that are going out there and custody transfer in large pipeline projects, and things like that. So, and then if you think of that environment, I mean, there's been a couple of very public shocks in that particular area as well. We're just, right now this spend is very intentional towards some other things, simple maintenance, and those kinds of items. So, I think it's going to be a little while before that breaks. That said, the international markets are a little different than what we're seeing here in North America, they're generally more favorable. That business has been pointed towards those strategically, long before we bought them. And we continue that way. So, we think that that's a nice extension for it. But I think as we saw, even with the events that happened here a little bit recently, it didn't take too many days for things to be offline before our economy felt it. And this business makes them incredibly great and nice pieces of technology that are very useful in that continuum. So, we like it for the long term and what it does. We think the prospects long term are positive in nature. But I think it's going to take a while for the spend here because of the nature of it, and where it's happening to break free. Nathan Jones : So, on a sequential basis, that we at least kind of hit the bottom or is there still more down here in your opinion? Eric Ashleman : No, I think the bottom is a fair characterization. Nathan Jones : Okay. And then I just want to follow up on the digital investment that you made in Fire and Rescue. Any color you can give us around what that is? What the future digital investments look like for IDEX and how you expect that to impact a variety of your businesses? Eric Ashleman : Yeah, so I mean, like it's really small, but from time to time, I think that's the nature with some of these things will be. I will tell you to the extent, some of the things we've been working on anyway. I'm talking about I think, for a while now, we've talked about some great work that we're doing to automate how that job happened. So, replacing a sea of levers, engages employees with a touchscreen, and we've got some outstanding products that we sell to automate that. Now, this small extension allows you to take some of that data off the truck, essentially, make it more affordable and available to be used in other areas for firefighters. So, I think it's a good example of the kind of things we'll probably see from time to time from IDEX, where there are some jobs that we're doing, and there's a way to enhance it and make it a lot more valuable. And sometimes it actually comes in very small, little transactions like this one. And so, it's an indicator of things to come and levers nice scale that we have in Fire and Rescue and a lot of things we've been working on for a number of years. Nathan Jones : Is this kind of technology transferable to other parts of the portfolio? Or is this really great kind of thing? Eric Ashleman : It could be. We select it for that reason. You know, you never say never. There's things here that you can imagine what happened in other places, we'd be careful given the small size of it. And just kind of an 80 :20 organization anyway, so focus on the job we need to do at hand. But I wouldn't rule it out entirely. Nathan Jones : Great, thanks for taking my questions. Eric Ashleman : Thanks, Nathan. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Rosenblatt Securities. Please proceed with your question. Scott Graham : Hey, good morning, Eric, Bill, Mike. Eric Ashleman : Good morning Scott. Scott Graham : A couple questions maybe around price cost. I know, I've heard all the commentary, would you be able to tell us what price cost actually was in the quarter? What that gap was? Eric Ashleman : Yeah, I mean, we said our historical price cost spread is somewhere around 20 - or excuse me 30 to 40 basis points. And we compressed a little bit under 20 within the quarter. And again, the pricing actions that we've taken, we look to be back at that normal level here as we progress through the back half of the year. Scott Graham : Got it, thank you. Now, the other thing I was going to ask you it is certainly around the projects, because some of these things can - or obviously can be very lucrative to you, because they are - the customer chooses you to do something exquisite so, swirl of pricing power in there. I was just wondering, kind of like, do you think that based on what you're seeing out there, some of this quoting activity that you're hearing about through distribution, is this a conversion into the, let's say, the early part of next year? You guys have a lot of experience on this stuff. So, when can this sort of funky cycle that we're in, - when would you normally start to see that? Is that early next year, you'll potential? Eric Ashleman : I mean, it's like it varies to some degree, but I would say the median of that distribution was, if you're talking about it now as a distributor level, there's things that we would have to do to be involved in terms of specifications and then their standard lead times. We're usually not the longest one anyways. It's easy other parts that would go into a project. So, if I just say, where's the medium zone, it's probably the beginning of 2022, where a lot of it would actually be put in place, things of that nature. So yeah, but some could be sooner. Some could be later. It again, depends. This is a wide spectrum, given the nature of IDEX, but probably the sweet spot would say, you talk about it now through the back half. You plan it, maybe get it booked. And you'll see some of it run out into the beginning part of next year. Scott Graham : Got it. Got it. And last question same for you, Eric. So, you talked to around why the organic was maybe a little bit below the guide. Is essentially, what you're saying here is that those delays move from 2Q to 3Q, which is maybe why 3Q is sort of like an outsized organic? Eric Ashleman : Well, I mean, it's like anything that was constrained on our side of courses, people still want it, it's going to move into the next place looking forward. What we're ultimately thinking about, not just us, but everybody is how you go to that next level of output and throughput and capacity? And of course, as you know, we're kind of low on the food chain in a lot of places, so it's only as good as everybody being able to make a move up at this point. So, I think right now, where we are, as a lot of things just kind of stabilize around this reality. Everybody's working on it, us included. We're coming up in the fall, maybe labor availability for people that are more labor intensive, that gets better. I think that's the kind of ramp that you would start to see. It's less a complex math problem and more just ultimately, people working like crazy to figure out a way to get to a place where you can process more of a backlog that many of us have. Scott Graham : Understood. And I promise this is my last question. This is the time of the year where your predecessor started to talk about a sort of a construct around 2022 sales. That was kind of what my earlier question was starting to get to. Anything you could offer on 2022 at this point, Eric? Eric Ashleman : I would not want to do that. Maybe this would normally be the time. But I mean, there's a lot of variables still out there, including one we haven't talked about yet here today, which was the nature of our virus go and things of that sort. So, I just, it would be too speculative and wouldn't really, I think, imply a lot. I think what we generally feel, as I said before, that we think that the strong ones that are back are going to continue. We know that we and others are working to elevate capacity and throughput, which is going to be beneficial to all of us. And there's just a function out there that eventually variables have a tendency to move over time, and they become expectation. And we see all of those things leading up for more positive data. Scott Graham : Thanks a lot. Eric Ashleman : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Our next question comes from the line up Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question. Matt Summerville : Thanks. A couple questions. The pricing has come up a couple times here in the Q&A and I was just wondering, Bill, if you could provide an absolute term what your price realization was through the first six months of the year? And how much incremental price capture you're looking forward to get back into that 30 :40 basis point spread you typically aim to be in? Bill Grogan : No, I mean, yeah, we were opposed to a little over points in the first half, we're going to accelerate from that in the back half would be kind of the framework I gave you. Matt Summerville : And then, given your answer to an earlier question Eric, a steady state of tough or bad or whatever sort of word you use I'm talking about supply chain. Is that resulting I would imagine in similar anxiety among your customer base with you being a supplier to them? In that sense, do you get the sense that they're pulling forward demand, they're over ordering? Can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of sell in and sell through into your distribution channel splits? Eric Ashleman : Yeah, so I would say like, we've had this question now for a couple of quarters, and generally, as you know we do a lot of customized products, a lot of things that are very, very hyper specific, don't have a lot of like just, high volume stocking orders and things like are part. So, we're not a great company to stock a lot of material. That being said, I probably would point to you, this quarter is a higher number of that. We're just because of I mean, our only times are expanding, and that's an unusual occurrence. We're aggressively doing some things on price, us and everybody else. So, there's I don't think it's a giant number for this, it's just kind of campaign. But it's in there more than we've seen before in terms of people trying to get a place in line or potentially say, hey, can I - I'll take a risk here. So, I can avoid part of the price increase, but it's going to since this is a pointer to the company, it's not a giant part only applies into. Distribution, or you go to a lot of our distributors, you're not going to see a lot of products on the shelf, mainly because of just the model, it's often needs to be customized at the last minute is done in this regard. We have quickly times anyway, that doesn't add a lot of value to sit on a shelf somewhere and make that gap. So, I guess long story short. We have probably a higher incidence of this than we typically do, but because of the nature of IDEX facility, really, really low number for us. Matt Summerville : Got it. Thank you, guys. Eric Ashleman : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question. Rob Wertheimer : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Eric Ashleman : Hi Rob. Rob Wertheimer : I was listening the comments you made in the prepared remarks on CapEx, spending opportunities, advanced manufacturing, and I wondered if you could expand on really in whatever direction you like. But I was curious about ROI versus inorganic investment right now, maybe specific margin improvement on projects that you're doing related to that. Maybe how far down the road you are going for a long time, or if there's a real shift here, and what it could mean for margin central over time, just love to hear more about it. Eric Ashleman : Alright, so like, we don't have a lot of CapEx intensity at IDEX anyway, but it is a ramp up from where we've typically been. A lot of it is attributed to the story around emerging markets grew up. So we're taking very deliberate actions in both our areas of concentration in China and India to make long term infrastructure depth over there to support a really, really, really good local for local capabilities that that we have. So, there's the big driver there that of course doesn't reoccur all that often. Outside of that, it's a next level down in the category of doing it more than we used to, would be things like factory floor automation. The technology is available, is pretty phenomenal today, and the cost points have come down to the point where even in our world, it makes sense from time to time to put a robot where somebody was standing for. Particularly, when we've got some labor availability issues, and a lot of its high technology base. So, those are projects that I think there's a graphic on the slide deck that I used, it's something that we're actually using in that area. That's, it's a great lever of operational productivity. It doesn't necessarily inflect the curve too tremendously. But it really helps us from a business perspective, concentrate our efforts on very talented people, and putting them in the areas where we're growing the company, and drawing from within as opposed to having to go out on the outside. So, anything\u2026 Bill Grogan : And I would say that the returns on those investments are highest return investments we can make. I mean, generally 2X or 3X what we do on the inorganic side, because the return profile, the market impact, these are kind of 12, 18 months return profiles for things on both the productivity and the growth side. Rob Wertheimer : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Giordano with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning, guys. This is Francesco on for Joe. Could you talk a little bit about just give us some detail on what you're seeing on municipal budgets and any sort of expectations there around the infrastructure bill as well? Eric Ashleman : Sure. Well, I mean, there's always an interesting dynamic there. I mean, I would say, number one, the financial positions of most municipalities, certainly here in the United States are probably thought to be better than they were, let's say a year ago. There's a lot of the stimulus money and things like that comes in and tax receipts generally been higher. So, I think just overall financial condition is good. Requested on the infrastructure spend thing is interesting. I mean, there's always a question of how long did you go from a concept to an actual project-based reality and how long that takes? Ultimately, there's different parts of IDEX where that would actually help us in a good way. I'd point to our Water business is one of them. There's a lot of talk in that bill about water infrastructure and the criticality there. I mean, one of our businesses does an awful lot of great work on sort of flow monitoring studies, which ultimately support CapEx projects, like you have to do one to then determine what it is you're going to buy in terms of CapEx. So, I think we're well positioned there. And there's some other pockets as well. But like always, it probably will take longer to play out and run through the system than we might imagine. But I would put it in the category just like in, they're seeing I think, for receipts in economics that is positive and certainly in a position that's better than I might have imagined it would be as we went into a pandemic. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks, that's very helpful. And if you could maybe talk a little bit about your expectations for Fire and Rescue. I know you guys have it down for the market outlook, but maybe a little bit more longer term, what drives the recovery there? Eric Ashleman : Sure, I mean, our Fire and Rescue business is I mean, they're phenomenal businesses. We've added to them over the years, we've got a nice, scalable concentration, and it's one of our most geographically dispersed businesses. You start with the premise that we've got incredible assets in that space. We've always said it was kind of a mature steady market for us as a backdrop overall. A couple of things going on there that at least in the near term, probably put it into the to the red zone most for us. One is that industry is even before the pandemic was struggling with output execution around chassis and trucks and things, and a couple of different geographies. Obviously, what's going on now is making that better. And so, just backlogs on fire trucks continues to be as long as it was a year ago, if not longer. So yeah, a little bit of a moderation effect there. And then in the emerging markets side, specifically China. And we've definitely seen - we've seen a couple of ways now of push for localization versus in our case, we actually do a fair amount of imported products into that zone to complement our local brand there as well. And I don't think long term that hasn't necessarily impacted us, but it doesn't impact it from a timing perspective, tends to keep tenders captive until we sort of see how it runs out. And so, that's maybe the new element on top of the existing element in it, and basically, it's pretty steady market anyways. I always encourage people when they think about it, this is where like, what we're doing in terms of our application sets on a critical job matters. So, like the discussion we had earlier about automation and the things that we're doing to change the nature of the job is the exciting element with great well positioned global assets. On a, you can still think of it as a mission critical job, very steady state, generally is going to be something that supported them long term with funding and things. But it does go through certain ebbs and flows. And right now, it's on one of the more red not green zones. But we think long term is going to be fine. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks a lot. Eric Ashleman : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Blair with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. Bryan Blair : Nice. Good morning, everyone. Eric Ashleman : Hi Bryan. Bryan Blair : I wanted to quickly follow up on Nathan's question regarding your digital investment in Fire and Rescue. Any color you can provide on how we should think about that technology an extension of Sam capabilities? Eric Ashleman : Well, I think without spending too much time on lots of details here, you can think of it what the SAM unit and for the others on a call, this is essentially the brand name of the trade name for the automation that we do within a mobile application. You know that, that brings together a lot of important data points, some of which are related to our hardware, some are related to others that are in that mobile platform. And you can think of it in the simplest way as this technology allows us to come off the truck, it's a way to make that happen to make it more mobile and less truck based. Bryan Blair : Okay, sounds like a very natural extension. And you offered, understandably nuance answer with regard to actionability of the M&A pipeline. In simple terms, can you share the size of this funnel relative to pre pandemic levels? Eric Ashleman : Certainly, in terms of ours, if we just listed up the things that are on there and added up potential transaction prices, it's larger. It's larger, I think, largely because of the work that we're putting in as we consider things and where we could go and how we could resource if the people internal in the company and consider the firepower that we had to deploy? So, yeah, I think it's safe to say there's a larger funnel by potential transaction size. Bryan Blair : Appreciate the color. Thanks, again. Eric Ashleman : Thank you, Bryan. Operator : There are no other questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks. Eric Ashleman : Okay, well, I'd like to thank you all for joining and spending some time with us here today. As we said in the prepared remarks in the beginning, I mean, really, really dynamic time with a lot of variables kind of swirling around. What we talked about in our businesses, we get all of that, and we deal with that on a day-to-day basis. But at the end, we ask people to take a deep breath, kind of come back and recognize that when a world kind of goes through, it's going through. It has a lot of problems that need to be solved and the IDEX Technologies that we have and the people that we have that drive them, they made up well with these kinds of demands. So, we've got well positioned businesses. We got incredible teams and talent. We're really, really focused, we're now to a phase of 80 :20, where it's very, very intuitive. And we're putting that to work and what's no doubt the dynamic and variable environment. At the end, I think the trade winds here are very favorable. We believe very strongly in our near term and our medium term and ultimately, the long term prospects of the company. But recognize we kind of have to live moment to moment as we're going through this with an eye on the horizon. And I assure you, that's the one that we're thinking about the most. Thanks again for joining us. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Allison Lausas, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer. Thank you. You may begin. Allison Lausas : Good morning, everyone. This is Allison Lausas, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for IDEX Corporation. Let me start by saying thank you for joining us for our discussion of the IDEX third quarter 2021 financial highlights. Last night, we issued a press release outlining our company's financial and operating performance for the 3 months ending September 30, 2021. The press release, along with the presentation slides to be used during today's webcast can be accessed on our company website at idexcorp.com. Joining me today is Eric Ashleman, our Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Grogan, our Chief Financial Officer -- The format for today's call is as follows. We will begin with Eric providing an overview of the state of IDEX's business and an overview of our end market performance. Bill will then discuss our third quarter 2021 financial results and provide an update on our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2021. Finally, Eric will conclude with an update on the IDEX Difference. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. If you should need to exit the call for any reason, you may access a complete replay beginning approximately 2 hours after the call concludes by dialing the toll-free number (877) 660-6853 and entering conference ID 13712091, or simply log on to our company homepage for the webcast replay. Before we begin, a brief reminder. This call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbor language in last night's press release and in IDEX's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I'll now turn this call over to our CEO, Eric Ashleman. Eric Ashleman : Thank you, Allison. Welcome to IDEX. It's a pleasure to have you on the team. I'd like to start by thanking Mike Yates, our former Chief Accounting Officer, for his 16 years of service to IDEX. Mike help lead an evolution of our finance and accounting organization and his work has had a long lasting impact on the business. On behalf of the entire IDEX team, I wish Mike the best in his future endeavors. Now let's turn to our IDEX overview on slide six. We continue to see supply chain challenges throughout the third quarter. Our localized sourcing, production and selling model helps us a bit relative to others, but this prolonged environment of poor material, labor and logistics availability challenges us just like any other business. Despite these obstacles, our IDEX teams around the globe have risen to the occasion. They exhibited both resiliency and stamina as they overcame yet another quarter filled with day-to-day disruptions, all while providing a high level of support to our customers. I want to thank all the IDEX team members across the globe for your hard work, not just in Q3 but over the last 18 months of business within a pandemic. At this stage, we don't see any near-term signs of diminishing macroeconomic headwinds. Rather, we expect they'll remain at a high level and persist into 2022. We'll continue to leverage our 80/20 principles as we align around our best customers, our best prospects for growth and our critical business priorities. I spoke last quarter about our ability to capture price due to the differentiated mission-critical nature of our products. Overall, the price actions that we took over the past six months were increasingly realized in the third quarter, and we saw our price, cost spread increase sequentially. We will push price aggressively and appropriately as conditions continue to support our arguments. Despite the many challenges out there, our organic performance remains strong. We set another record in the third quarter for orders, sales and backlog. Our backlog is now $186 million higher than it was at the end of last year. Signals around the return of industrial projects have intensified and current energy prices, if sustained, have the potential to drive investments within IDEX application areas. Our Health Science and Technologies segment performed exceptionally well. Over the past 5 or so years, we have stepped up organic investments with our focus on the longer term. Within our sealing business, we built a new facility with the goal of capturing share in the expanding semiconductor market. We brought three optics facilities together, and our new Optics Center of Excellence to enable future wins in life sciences by integrating multiple IDEX components to create value for our customers. We optimized the footprint and core technology of our material processing technology platform to enable long-term repeatable growth across a series of technologies. These investments have generated tremendous returns, and we are well positioned to capture share and capitalize on market growth going forward. On the inorganic side, our recent acquisitions are doing extremely well. Abel Pumps is fully integrated and performing ahead of expectations. The Airtech integration is ahead of schedule, and the team is making strong progress on their growth strategy. Both are executing well in the challenging operating environment as they come up to speed on our 80/20 playbook. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we have ample capital available to support future acquisitions and investments in the business. Our M&A funnel is healthy. Our expanded team has identified a number of interesting opportunities as we look to deploy additional capital in the near and long term. In the end, we are focused on delivering and growing within a very difficult near term operating environment while spending a significant part of each day thinking about the best investments in teams, technologies and business opportunities to thrive in the years to come. I'm very confident in our team's ability to outperform in both areas. With that, I'll turn to our market outlook on page seven. In our Fluid & Metering technology segment, industrial day rates were favorable versus the second quarter. Larger industrial projects still lag, but quote activity and funnel strength have both improved. Agriculture remains robust, delivering on record volumes. Our water businesses continue to perform well. Municipal spending is steady, and there is general optimism around future increased government funding. The chemical and energy markets continue to lag primarily due to limited capital investment. However, on the chemical side, smaller, fast starting projects performed well. We are cautiously optimistic on energy as increased fuel prices and concerns over energy shortages have the potential to trigger investment. As we noted last quarter, our Flow MD business has experienced a significant pullback in customers' capital investments. It impacted FMT's organic sales by 8%. In other words, excluding the impact of Flow MD, FMT organic sales would have grown 15% instead of 7% as reported. Moving to the Health & Science Technologies segment. We continue to see strong demand across all our end markets. Semiconductor, food and pharma, analytical instrumentation and life sciences all performed well. We continue to win share through our targeted growth initiatives, and our intentionality around identifying opportunities that grow faster than the broader market is paying off. The automotive market remains affected by supply chain-driven challenges, but we continue to see growth due to our concentration in higher end European vehicles. The industrial businesses within the segment saw a trend similar to FMT. Finally, our Fire & Safety Diversified Products segment is our most challenged segment right now. Price capture and volume offsets faced stronger headwinds within the segment due to higher direct OEM exposure and higher levels of material intensity due to vertical integration. In Fire & Safety, North America Fire OEM production continues to struggle due to supply chain challenges. Larger tender activity is slowly increasing within the global Fire Rescue markets, but we feel these market challenges will persist into 2022. US automotive production pullbacks due to microprocessor shortages have tempered the performance of our banded business. We continue to achieve new platform wins and believe we're well positioned to supply chain constraints eventually ease. But in the third quarter, the impact of automotive shutdowns increased versus last quarter and moderated our performance. Finally, dispensing performed well as key customers deploy capital on strong DIY market demand, and our global product offerings capture share. We continue to closely monitor market conditions and expect rolling supply chain disruptions to continue throughout the balance of the year and into 2022. That said, our third quarter organic orders were flat sequentially versus second quarter, and our backlog remains at a record level. Overall, the demand environment for IDEX products is not weighed [ph] despite supply chain challenges, and we remain optimistic about the trajectory of our end markets. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results. Bill Grogan : Thanks, Eric. I'll start with our consolidated financial results on slide nine. Q3 orders of $774 million were up 36% overall and up 28% organically. We built $62 million of backlog in the quarter, and all three segments had strong organic performance versus last year as well as versus the third quarter of 2019. Third quarter sales of $712 million were up 23% overall and up 15% organically. We continue to experience a strong rebound from the pandemic across our portfolio, tempered by supply chain constraints. The Flow MD pressure and Fluid & Metering Eric discussed, also had an impact on overall organic sales. Excluding Flow MD, organic sales would have been up 18% overall. Q3 gross margin expanded 50 basis points to 43.8%. The increase over the prior year quarter was primarily driven by increased volume and price capture, partly offset by inflation and supply chain impacts. Excluding the impact of a $9.1 million pretax fair value inventory step-up charge related to the Airtech acquisition, adjusted gross margin was 45%, and improved sequentially. Third quarter operating margin was 22.6%, flat compared to prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 24.3%, up 120 basis points compared to prior year, largely driven by our gross margin expansion and fixed cost leverage, offset with some pressure from targeted reinvestments and the dilutive impact of Airtech and ABEL acquisitions due to their intangible amortization costs. I will discuss the drivers of operating income in more detail on the next slide. Our Q3 effective tax rate was 23.4%, which was higher than the prior year ETR of 14.4% due to the finalization of tax regulations enacted in the third quarter of 2020 as well as a decrease in the excess tax benefit related to share-based compensation in the current period. Third quarter net income was $116 million, which resulted in an EPS of $1.51. Adjusted net income was $125 million, resulting in an adjusted EPS of $1.63, up $0.23 or 16% over prior year adjusted EPS. The tax rate movement I mentioned drives a $0.27 differential in EPS as compared to the prior year quarter. Said differently, our EPS would have expanded by $0.50 or 35% had 2021 been taxed at the 2020 rate. Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $142 million, up 5% compared to prior year, and was 113% of adjusted net income. The result was impacted by higher earnings, partly offset by volume-driven working capital build. Our working capital efficiency metrics remain strong, and the teams continue to do a good job managing significant year-over-year volume and supply chain challenges. Moving on to slide 10, which details the drivers of our adjusted operating profit. Adjusted operating income increased $39 million for the quarter compared to the prior year. Our 15% organic growth contributed approximately $29 million, flowing through at our prior year gross margin rate. We achieved positive price cost within the quarter, and saw our price, cost spread improved sequentially. Our teams continue to drive operational productivity as another lever to help mitigate the profit headwinds we experienced from supply chain costs and associated inefficiencies. The positive mix is a primary result of the portfolio and business mix normalizing to pre-pandemic levels that had a negative impact on our results last year. As Eric mentioned, we are actively investing in the resources we need to execute on future growth and productivity. This reinvestment back into the business, higher variable compensation and targeted increases in discretionary spending drive the year-over-year pressure of $15 million. Despite the incremental spend, inflation and supply chain-driven operational efficiencies, we still achieved a solid 37% organic flow-through. Flow-through is then negatively impacted by the dilutive impact of acquisitions and FX, getting us to a reported flow-through of 30%. With a significant amount of focus dedicated to navigating supply chain disruptions, we did not fully execute on the level of spend we expected in the quarter. We intend to make these investments in the fourth quarter, and they will mitigate our flow-through a bit as we close out the year. With that, I would like to provide an update on our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year. I'm on slide 11. For the fourth quarter, we are projecting adjusted EPS to range from $1.55 to $1.58. We expect organic revenue growth of 9% to 10% and adjusted operating margins between 23.5% and 24%. Q4 results are slightly lower than the third quarter, driven by organic and inorganic resource investments seasonality and the potential for year-end logistics challenges. The Q4 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23%. We expect about 0.5% of top line benefit from FX, and corporate costs in Q4 are expected to be around $19 million. Turning to the full year. We are narrowing our full year EPS guidance from a range of $6.26 to $6.36 to $6.30 to $6.33. We are also maintaining our full year organic growth of 11% to 12%. We expect operating margins of approximately 24%. We expect FX to provide 1.5% benefit to top line results. The full year effective tax rate is expected to be around 23%. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be around $65 million, in line with our previous guidance. Free cash flow is expected to be around 105% of net income, lower versus our last guide primarily due to working capital investments. And corporate costs are expected to be approximately $73 million for the year. Our earnings guidance excludes impacts from future acquisitions and any future restructuring charges. Finally, beginning in 2022, IDEX will provide EPS guidance and report actual results, excluding the impacts of after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization. We believe reporting adjusted EPS on this basis will provide more transparency to our core operating results as well as facilitate comparisons with our peer companies as we continue on our capital deployment journey. With that, I'll throw it back to Eric for some final thoughts. Eric Ashleman : Thanks, Bill. I'm on the final slide, slide 12. Before we open the call up to questions, I'd like to share a few updates around our great teams. First off, I'd like to extend my public congratulations to our Non-Executive Chairman, Bill Cook, on being named Public Company Director of the Year by the National Association of Corporate Directors. Bill and I both joined IDEX around the same time in 2008, and I've learned a great deal from him over the years. His insightful perspective and critical thinking skills have been tremendously helpful for the company, and I know I speak for everyone at IDEX when I say congratulations, Bill, on this well deserved honor. Turning to the IDEX Foundation. Last month, the foundation entered a national partnership with the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. Various US-based business units have supported their local boys and girls clubs over the years, but this takes our joint work to the next level, offering a clear pathway for increased engagement. Every one of our U.S. business units is close to at least one boys and girls club location. This agreement aligns with the foundation's equity and opportunity charitable pillar added earlier this year, seeking to create opportunities for underserved disadvantaged people of color within our community. Finally, we attribute much of our success to our strong foundational culture. Our annual September engagement survey just came back. And even within this incredibly challenging environment, loaded with disruptions in unexpected turns, we held study and were scored in the top quartile of all manufacturing companies. Our teams around the world are beginning to develop tactical plans to address feedback provided by their local teams, part of the continuous improvement that supports everything we do at IDEX. With that, let me pause and turn it over to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Eric Ashleman : I think we lost Nathan. Nathan Jones : Can you hear me? Eric Ashleman : Now we can. Bill Grogan : Now we can. Nathan Jones : Okay. All's Well That Ends Well. First question just on this discretionary reinvestment it wasn't called out on the walk in the first quarter, ramped up in second quarter and third quarter. And I think Bill said in his comments that you didn't actually spend as much in the third quarter as you intended. I think that margin guidance for the fourth quarter is down a little bit. Is that all just coming from the extra discretionary reinvestment in growth that you guys are looking at in the fourth quarter? Bill Grogan : Yeah, I know exactly. I think the teams have done a good job managing and focusing on the critical things that we need to invest within the business. In the third quarter relative to - obviously, there's high demand for labor across a bunch of businesses, a bunch of different geographies and some head count and other items that we thought we would have landed in the third quarter just got pushed to the fourth quarter. So that will come back and put a little bit of mitigation on our overall flow-through, but still relatively strong. Nathan Jones : Okay. And then one of the things I got from your press release was a quote where you said macro constraints that inhibit customer satisfaction. I assume that means that all of these constraints are leading to lower on-time delivery metrics for you guys. Can you talk about how much that slipped, if there's any anticipation, you'll be able to get them back up quickly, and if that impacts your ability to push pricing at all? Eric Ashleman : Sure. Well, it's less a function, Nathan, of on-time delivery and actually a function of extending lead times and then hitting those commitments. So I mean, we've maintained a high say-do ratio relative to our customers. We use the 80/20 lens to provide differentiated services for different levels of customers, so all of that remains constant. But in this environment, the part that I think we're all struggling with is just inherently the lead times in the queue is lengthening. So it's really that - your question around when does it resolve. I think, as we indicated, it's further out on the horizon, quite honestly. I mean a bunch of the knobs have to turn together, material availability, labor availability across the spectrum and logistics. So as those start to move and start to move in, and all of us can depend on higher levels of throughput, we would be able to bring lead times back in. And ultimately, against all of that, still maintain that high [indiscernible] ratio. So it's, again, less on OTD rates and more on just lengthening lead times against expectations. Nathan Jones : And does it impact your ability to push price at all? Or are customers just conditioned at this point that lead times are extending, and they just have to deal with it? Eric Ashleman : Yeah. It really hasn't interfered. I mean, one of the things we're always tracking is lead times relative to our typical traditional performance as well as then competitively. And because our model has generally been advantaged this way it remains so on a relative basis. So as long as that holds, that generally keeps all of the arguments and the equations where we like them. Nathan Jones : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I'll pass it on. Eric Ashleman : Thanks, Nat. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Eric Ashleman : Morning, Deane. Deane Dray : First, welcome to Allison. Best of luck. Secondly, great to see you guys moving to cash EPS, it makes all kinds of sense for you, put you on that level-playing field with your growth by acquisition peers. So a great move no surprise there. So thank you. The question - so let's just roll the clock back to last quarter, and I think you guys are one of the few that thought that the whole supply chain inflation had plateaued, but it really has not. Maybe if you could just - you've kind of given the description that we've heard from everyone about inflation, supply chain, labor, et cetera. But where are you feeling the greatest pain? And is there - just to clarify on Nate's question, are there any -- have you missed out on revenues? And can you quantify that? Eric Ashleman : Okay. So look, I mean supply chain has been a tough story for at least 6 months, and continue here into the fourth quarter. We did say at it plateaued, we said that relative to a pretty tough situation. So tough in the second quarter, tough in the third and continued tough in the fourth with, frankly, some year end dynamics that always make that quarter a little bit tougher. And so we're thinking of those as we project forward. Your question around what are we experiencing? Well, I mean there's a lot of variety in IDEX. But one thing that makes us all about the same is we tend to buy a lot of configured materials. We're not overly vertically integrated, so material availability is the #1 challenge. . And then it does vary. We've got some businesses - a few that are more semiconductor and ship-intensive. And then as you suspect, those tend to be the items for those businesses. Others, it's things like motors and castings. And typically, if they're coming from further away, that's a harder challenge. Labor availability for us, we don't have labor as a high percentage of our sales, but we do have pockets and it tracks pretty uniformly where labor is scarce either in the US or in other geographies. And I'd say as an overlay, I'd probably say all of IDEX to some degree, is continuing to try to track down scarce logistics resources, especially on smaller shipments or things that are going overseas. So I know that pretty much covers the spectrum of all possibilities. But if you want to just put a bow around it for us, it's material availability coming in through a supply chain of configured materials. Bill Grogan : And then, Deane, maybe to your lost revenue comment, I think holistically, no. Obviously, we've got critical products across the portfolio that are spec-ed in, and high demand. This isn't a commodity application where folks can get it a week faster for dollar cheaper, they're going to go with that product. So relative to loss revenue or our ability to capture price the differentiation we have with our technology continues to support our incremental price increases across the different businesses. Deane Dray : All right. That's all really helpful. And just last one for me. You commented on record backlog, is there - and extended lead times, is there any chance that you'll need to go back and reprice any of that backlog? Just older it is, the more that material cost inflation weighs on it and so forth. What's your flexibility there? Bill Grogan : Yeah, where we have the ability to do that, we're not contractually constrained. We have done that as we progress through the year. Eric Ashleman : Yes. Deane Dray : Great. Thanks for all the help. Eric Ashleman : Thanks, Deane. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Mike Halloran : Good morning, everyone. So a couple of questions here. First, a lot of moving pieces in the environment as we sit here today. Certainly appreciate the color that you gave us, I guess, in this case, literally the green and red colors you gave us, and the various end markets and how those were performing. Maybe you can just start triangulating some thoughts on how you're thinking about those markets as we move into next year and maybe even through the next couple of years. Your concern level with all of the supply chain challenges, degrading demand, having some sort of circular challenge versus how you think about sustainability of the recovery curve as we sit here today and just how you balance all those moving pieces out internally? Eric Ashleman : Sure. So there is a couple of things there. Yeah, relative to kind of the green and red chart that we provide folks. It hasn't changed a lot over the last couple of quarters in terms of the few areas that are lagging. So I'll just - I'll sort of leave those as those stories continue in energy and chemical, and we can go into those later if we like. But I'd say a few things that are new here would be - the automotive side did flip over to red for us. There's just no question but more disruption, more shutdowns even on the higher end stuff where our products tend to have good presence. . Again, a small piece of IDEX, but it is something that's changed and changed a little different. I think if you kind of come up to a segment level, I mean, as you can see from our prepared remarks, and just in our numbers, I mean, the Health Science Technology segment is doing really, really well, very, very strong got semiconductor. That's where our exposure is. That's a strong market. Anything in analytical instrumentation, life science, the food areas. We've got some pharma in there as well. Those are just kind of universally strong and we would expect those to continue strong going forward. I think we talk a lot, of course, and we turn over to FMT and our project business and the nature of those. And we have seen some movement there. This has been a slow march of progress through the year. But I would say in the areas of food and pharma, in particular, you are starting to see a shift towards some intentional capacity expansion, which lends itself into discussions with folks like us and others around project business. In places on a more classic FMT side of the spectrum : chemicals, energy. That's lagging on the other side, although even in chemicals, some of the faster turn projects we're seeing those come about. And then in that sort of right down the middle of the fairway industrial environment where a lot of our FMT businesses play. The discussions continue to move, and we are starting to see a bit of that hit-the-order board, at least indicate that it will in the first part of 2022. So I just -- I wouldn't say that the acceleration curve is different, but it continues to move more positively. Second part of your question was really around sort of the supply chain condition and it's run out. I think we were talking about this morning. I would be interesting is, overall, I think this is playing out indicating that there's still a lot of capacity that has to be put to work in the industrial space. You got too many places running 12 hours, 13 hours and running their equipment into the ground. Then some of the challenges with labor scarcity. I mean that lends itself towards automation and other things that are going to provide some support. So I do feel good about the longer-range winds at our backs and others in the industrial space. The near-term challenge, of course, is that we're sitting here, and a lot of other companies are sitting with a lot of backlog and in some ways, kind of a steady output that we wish was higher because of the supply chain challenges. Eventually, those 2 lines cross. We -- I would like to think that what would happen is the throughput would continue to increase its capacity is supplied as people come back to work and begins to catch that order rate and then it continues in a great direction. I think that's the open question for all of us is sort of how do these things resolve. Those 2 rates resolve over time in, let's say, the next 2 quarters coming into 2022. And so we're going to have to watch all of the inputs and the variables that are driving that, a pretty complex equation, of course. But I'd end with saying continued positivity, the rates of progression are -- we're seeing those feeling those, and feel good about them. It all kind of comes down to a few things that are variable in the near term. Mike Halloran : Appreciate that. And then just usual kind of update, M&A outlook, how you think about funnel actionability? Any color around that? Eric Ashleman : Yeah. No. I mean very good. As we've talked about through most of the year here, we were intentional of putting some more resources on this job. We're looking at more projects, more interesting ideas out there traveling around. We're kicking the tires on a lot of things and have a strong funnel in a variety of areas, both things that apply to IDEX businesses and are in close universes as well as kind of an open line of things that are interesting and IDEX like that we might consider over time. So both in good shape, and we're excited about prospects there as we go forward. . Mike Halloran : Thanks, everyone. Appreciate it. Eric Ashleman : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question. Matt Summerville : Thanks. Just with respect to the change in reporting as it relates to acquired intangibles amortization, what is that number build for IDEX expected to be in '21? And if you have something you can give us for '22, that might be helpful. And then I have a follow-up. Bill Grogan : Yes. Matt, we'll give guidance on what that number was for '21, and our go-forward guide once we come out with our numbers in late January. Matt Summerville : Okay. And then with respect to Flow MD, the volatility you've seen in that business, Eric, seems a bit outside of what I tend to call on IDEX-like business. I was wondering if you could just give a little more thoughts on how we should be thinking about that going forward. Eric Ashleman : Sure. Sure. Well, it has some attributes. I mean it's very IDEX-like in terms of the problems it solves, and sort of position on the bill of materials for the fossil fuels infrastructure in the country. So that is typical. But you're right, relative to the average IDEX business, the unit of measure of the sale price of the product is a lot larger. This is -- these are pretty large units. In fact, the nature of projects in terms of how those orders come to us are larger as well. It tends to be very much a capital-intensive kind of way of doing business. And so this is a business that, remember, if we just back up over the last year when we acquired it, had really, really high levels of backlog because they captured a lot of projects long ago prior to the acquisition. Then, of course, things change pretty dramatically in terms of how the major folks that are in charge of the pipelines in the U.S. We're talking about capital spend. We burned off that backlog and now find ourselves kind of in a steady state against replenishments and maintenance projects. We do a few things internationally. But the core of this business is still ultimately around the build-out or refurbishment around pipeline infrastructure in the US. It comes in larger project increments, and the sale price of the end product is larger. So the - for all of those reasons, the magnitude year-over-year is a larger swing than you would typically see in IDEX. That's why we've been careful to call it out and make sure people understand it within the FMT results. Matt Summerville : Got it. And then just one final one. Just in terms of pricing, you typically get somewhere in the range of 100, maybe 150 basis points in a good year. And I'm curious as to where your realization is on a year-over-year basis at the present time? And how much of that should be viewed as more -- as permanent in nature versus maybe some of that's more surcharge like? So any color you could provide there would be helpful. Bill Grogan : Yes. No. So we're in excess of 200 basis points this year. It will be a record year for price capture for the organization. Majority of it is permanent price increases. Obviously, we looked at surcharges on the freight side as that's been much more variable to offset that. But most of it will continue into our base level pricing for 2022. Matt Summerville : Great. Thank you, guys. Bill Grogan : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Allison Poliniak : Hi, good morning. And welcome, Allison. Eric, I want to go back to your comments and just kind of beat this up a little bit more. Supply chains tempering a little bit of the growth. I guess, one, is there a way to quantify sort of what that impact was in the quarter in terms of maybe lost one or two points of organic. Then I guess - and then along with that, Bill, you talked about working capital, some increases there, and I suspect part of that is a supply chain issue. Is there an opportunity here for you guys to attack, and maybe more fully in the first part of next year, some of those lead times and start to bring them in a little bit? Just any color there? Eric Ashleman : Sure, Allison. In terms of output, we could have realized with a slightly more favorable backdrop in the supply chain, probably in the range of a couple of percentage points of the organic rates that we posted. Just simply had the order, could have made it and can point to something that prevented it in one of those 3 categories that I talked to. I'll let Bill talk about the inventory. I will say we, like many businesses, on critical material if we can get it even if it doesn't make up perfectly with some other things, we're going to -- we'll take the spot and take the material. So there's a little bit of investment in working capital there. I think the last part of your question around, can we attack it? I think like a lot of other businesses, we're scrambling to lift our capacity and help our supply chain in any way we can on all dimensions. So some businesses are attacking the labor scarcity issue in very unique ways and very innovative, quite honestly. Others and most of it comes down to, in some places, capital spend. We're doing some things and thinking through capital that we know we have to put into the business so we kind of watch that ramp throughout the year. And that makes sense, and wherever possible. IDEX is not an easy business to automate, but we're doing it more than we have been before because it also helps solve the labor issue. Sometimes this comes down to design, which is something that people don't think a lot about. Sometimes you can actually alter designs, whether it's in simple circuitry or even some of the other parts that we have, and assist with fabrication. This is where our local proximity really helps us. So we can get in a car and drive over to a supplier and kind of have a collaborative discussion of, is there a different way to solve this problem and bring material in. So it's pretty much every day, if you went to one of our daily management sessions, you'd probably see that 70% of the discussion is around solving problems of this nature, both in the short term, and then wherever possible, and longer term in terms of investments or problem-solving. Bill Grogan : Yes. And I think there will be opportunities on the working capital side once things normalize, but time will tell when that is. We're assuming back half of next year, but we'll see. Allison Poliniak : Got it. And then just in terms of HST, strong quarter there. And you had mentioned, obviously, investments have been starting -- certainly contribute to core. Is there a way to quantify sort of what that contribution to core was this quarter as well as any comments on sort of the mix impact that some of those investments are having in terms of those products being delivered today? Bill Grogan : No. I'd say when you look across the portfolio, there's been robust margin expansion in almost -- well I shouldn't say almost, in every single reporting unit. Since we have -- we highlighted a couple, but there's been targeted investments in all entities within the HST segment that have -- you just look at the overall margin expansion that we've experienced there as we realize some of the incremental revenue associated with it. And because of the differentiated nature of that technology, the high margin associated with it. We did some folks highlight. Sequentially, the margin was down in HST, but that's really due to Airtech coming into the portfolio. On a like-for-like basis, margins are still at kind of those all-time highs we saw in the second quarter, and look for that in the core to continue here as we go forward. Allison Poliniak : Got it. Thank you. Bill Grogan : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, good morning. This is Robert in for Joe. Yeah, I just wanted to touch on orders again. Do you have any sense of how much your customers are trying to like build their inventory. And I guess also like how much of the order activity feels consistent with like actual demand trends. Eric Ashleman : Yeah. No, it's a good question. I mean, so a couple of things. One is when we think about the nature of most IDEX products, it's highly configured, some ways customized for each application. And so typically, it's not a great product to over order lots up because you're never quite sure of how it's going to run out when the customer system. I would say what is a little different as we go through the year here in terms of typical patterns, it's just lengthening of sort of order horizon. So if somebody would have before given us, let's say, six months' worth of requirements, they might throw another quarter in there, recognizing, hey, this is a standard product. We know we're going to use it in this particular case, and we don't want to lose a place in line. That tracks actually with our own lead times as we extended those lead times, most equations would work and say then that's how you would change your order patterns to accommodate it. So I really - we've never seen a tremendous run-up of inventory IDEX material. Our distributors and channel within FMT doesn't really work that way. Most people still, as they think of planning for IDEX products, think of us as generally on the very agile, reactive end of the spectrum, and they haven't really changed their thinking around it as the entire world kind of goes through a relative change in shift outward. Unidentified Analyst : That's helpful. Thank you for that. And then I guess I have a quick one also, just a follow-up on the M&A pipeline. It sounds like you said is very healthy, and integration of Airtech, which is one of your largest acquisitions to date, is going well. And with all the focus that you have internally on those initiatives going forward. This might be a break from previous acquisition behavior, but would you all be considering anything more transformational in nature, like a really big acquisition that might be like a new segment or something like that? Eric Ashleman : Well, I mean, I'd say 2 things there. One, we always consider kind of every chapter within possibilities, things that are very small, like little pieces of technology we want to tuck-ins, things like in Airtech or, frankly, ABEL pumps, which are more typical of IDEX transactions in the past. And then we do consider from time-to-time things at the other end of the spectrum that are larger. I think you always want to exercise that muscle, but we're always careful to say, for something in that category, it would have to have very IDEX-like characteristics to mitigate risk. And there's just not a giant universe of things that are in that particular bucket. And if there were, actionability is always somewhat of a question. And so we do consider it from time to time, we don't turn that switch off, but we recognize the probability is generally lower for the reasons that I suggested there. Just thinking about how it would mix and complement IDEX and where it would attach given the large size that you're describing. But every one of those chapters is something that we kind of walk it down as a book in our own follow-up calls. Unidentified Analyst : That\u2019s great. Thank you very much. Eric Ashleman : Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions in the queue at this time. I'd like to hand the call back over to - no, we do have another question from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question. Rob Wertheimer : Hi, everybody. Just a little bit curious if you can give more background around the targeted spending. You mentioned Fire & Safety, cost pressure mitigation and/or whatever. And then you've been talking about the discretionary investments for a couple of quarters. I know last year, there's obviously some discretionary cuts. But just generally speaking, are you seeing more opportunity? Are you trying to change anything in the way you attack opportunities with the investments? Thanks. Eric Ashleman : Sure. I mean, generally, when we talk about growth investments in IDEX, they often walk on 2 legs. I mean they're people that we're going to bring into the business with specific skills for the charter to go focus in front-end areas, usually on the commercial side or strategic or thinking around putting the balance sheet to work. So there are other things that we'll do, sometimes third-party services, a couple of things in terms of nurturing and shaping technology, but a lot of times, it comes down to people-based investments. And just amping up the ability to go out and study things, spend time in the field, get the inputs that we need to then begin to modulate the technologies that we have in-house or the others we might bring in. Rob Wertheimer : Okay. Perfect. That's a helpful response. And then just in Fire & Safety. And then just a path to -- I don't know, the path and mechanism on recapturing some of the cost pressures there. And I will stop. Thank you. Eric Ashleman : Yeah. I mean it's just a little off the IDEX typical. We do, as we mentioned, have a little bit more OEM concentration there. this is where some of the larger project work tends to be as well. You put the two things together, and you're not as able as we are in FMT and other places to just sort of go out and make those discrete changes quickly. So it doesn't mean we don't get that capture. The margin performance over time would absolutely verify that we do. It's just -- it does tend to lag a little bit from the rest of the more typical IDEX location. So - but the arguments, the pricing argument around criticality of solution and leveraging our position, our number one share position within those niches and our long relationship with customers, that's basically the same equation. It's just you have to be a little bit more cognizant of the timing and the duration of projects and things that are just a little different there. So we wouldn't see this as something that's going to dramatically alter the margin performance of that company over time or those businesses, but it will take us a little longer to catch up here. Rob Wertheimer : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vlad Bystricky with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Vlad Bystricky : Good morning, team. Thanks for taking the call. Eric Ashleman : Morning. Vlad Bystricky : So just wanted to follow up on some of the reinvestment that you're doing, and particularly given supply chain and logistics issues you see out there now. Has your thinking about where you're targeting investment dollars evolved or changed over the course of the year as you've seen the supply chain and inflationary pressures continue to increase and not really get any better? Eric Ashleman : Yeah. I mean that's a great question. And the short answer is no. When you think about -- when you consider the cycles of our business, one of the things that's really, really important is that even as near-term things like supply chain challenges, all the stuff we talked about, disrupt the day-to-day, and maybe that even continues for a series of quarters, the best that you're going to make, you got to consider as you're making them today to sometimes flares 2, 3, 5 years in the future. And I was reflecting when we talked about all the positive aspects that are happening in HST, many of which were coming out of specific facilities that we bought for specific reasons to get it in different markets, actually went back and checked the dates. Those were commissioned in 2016, '17 and '18, basically, and they're now at full fruition here, and we're very glad we made those bets. So we just have to be very aware of sort of longer-term trends, longer-term positioning and make sure that we're both doing two things simultaneously. One, reacting appropriately to the disruptions in front of us, but also projecting and extending ourselves into '23, '24, '25 and making sure that those bets and those first discussions around growth are actually happening now. Vlad Bystricky : Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks. And then maybe just shifting gears a bit. I know Asia is a smaller piece of the mix for you versus the U.S. and Europe. But can you talk about what you saw in terms of growth trends in the region over the course of 3Q and into 4Q, given the evolving COVID situation and policy responses in countries like China and Malaysia? Eric Ashleman : Yeah. And I preface both. I mean most of our areas where we play. We've got a campus in India, a campus in China, and then we've got some commercial things across broader Southeast Asia. And I would say, in general, those have performed very well for us, the last few years. They have performed well in 2021. I remind everybody it is a smaller portion of IDEX, and we attack it in a really surgical way. So we're picking specific niches, specific applications and then mating up technologies that we have available in IDEX to go after those. That -- I mean we're picking them because we think in many times, they're somewhat immune to some of the ebbs and flows that you would see more day-to-day or quarter-to-quarter because they've got growth dynamics at their back. So we're doing things in air ventilators and things for high altitude, or paint dispensing is a great market across all of that region for that specific reason. Now specifically, I would say we -- as a backdrop, I don't think we're seeing things that are different than others have talked about in terms of more moderate growth rates in China. And in a couple of instances, I'll talk to China specifically, we have some headwinds where there's -- and we mentioned this, there's a build for China belief out there around certain markets and things that they are very interested in investing in -- and that provides headwinds for us, but I would say that's where innovation kicks in. What we're able to offer is quite different than the local option. -- just means the sales cycle has extended a little longer, a little harder, but ultimately, we think our differentiation wins there. It's been a great performing region for us. Vlad Bystricky : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks. Eric Ashleman : Thanks. Operator : There are no further questions in the queue at this time. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks. Eric Ashleman : Okay. Well, thank you. Again, I'd like to welcome Allison to our team and our session here and thank everybody for your interest and your time today to hear what's going on at IDEX. As we said, it's a really interesting time, a lot of challenges out there. My closing comments would be for those IDEX associates that are on this call. Again, I really want to thank you. I know how hard this is in terms of the day-to-day challenges you have. I know you're doing the right things for the customers, for the business and for your colleagues and frankly, your communities as well. So thanks to everybody. And I wish you all safety and prosperity in the days and weeks ahead. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.+",

This call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbor language in last night's press release and in IDEX's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I'll now turn this call over to our CEO, Eric Ashleman. Eric Ashleman : Thank you, Allison. I'm on Slide 6. 2021 year was another record year for IDEX. We hit all-time highs on most of our key metrics. Demand for our differentiated technology remains strong. This underlying momentum combined with our targeted growth initiatives and ability to capture price drove a strong rebound from 2020. Across most of our portfolio, we saw an expansion beyond pre -pandemic revenue levels. In the fourth quarter, we achieved a record for orders and sales and our backlog position is very strong as we enter 2022. We expanded our margins in a highly inflationary environment. We levered well in the previous investments we made to optimize our cost position and executed on our productivity funnel. We maintained positive price cost, albeit at a compressed level versus historic performance. We remained diligent in controlling our discretionary spend and used our 80/20 principles to allocate resources to our most promising opportunities. Our strategic focus, purposeful resourcing, and strong operating cash flow enabled us to deploy record capital.  We acquired ABEL Pumps and Airtech and made a collaborative investment in a technology company driving advancements in connected products. We also invested across the portfolio to support growth and productivity. We optimized our cost position within our Fluid & Metering technology segment through a consolidation of our Italy facilities and our energy businesses and delivered on operational productivity projects across the segment. All of this drove a record year in orders, sales margins, earnings, and capital deployment. We said in the past that we built IDEX to outperform through a cycle, and we continue to find ourselves in a very challenging one, characterized by supply chain disruptions and labor scarcity exacerbated throughout the year by the emergence of new COVID-19 variants. Our view continues to be that we don't see gradients of bad, rather the supply chain environment is very tough and numerous challenges persist. As pockets of issues improve, they tend to be replaced by new obstacles. Our teams have done an excellent job navigating these day-to-day operational issues.  And I'd like to take a moment to thank our IDEX employees around the globe for their dedication and perseverance throughout this prolonged period of disruption. The agility of our teams, adjusting to new issues almost every day has been and continues to be outstanding. As we look forward to 2022, we did not see any near-term signs of diminishing supply chain related headwinds, and the impact of COVID-19 remains highly variable. In the short term, these conditions have and will impact our ability to efficiently ramp production and have created significant pockets of disruption for our customers and suppliers as well. We expect that these challenges will remain at a high level, at least through the first half of 2022. Regardless of the near-term challenges, our overall IDEX strategy remains focused on the horizon. The core of what makes IDEX strong, highly engineered, specialized products used in mission-critical applications, remains a solid driver for long-term success will continue to deploy capital and invest in the resources necessary to drive organic growth in order to capitalize on a robust demand environment.  Our balance sheet has ample capacity and we will leverage that strength to continue to play offense in M&A. To that end, we expect to close on the acquisition of Next Site later this quarter. The technologies and capabilities within their business segments will nicely complement our water platform within FMT. With that, I'll turn to our outlook for our segments on page seven. In our Fluid & Metering Technology segment, we anticipate growth in our industrial day rate businesses in 2022 with a return of larger projects towards the latter half of the year. And the short term, large projects continue to lag as our customers have limited capacity to execute larger upgrades or expansions. Agriculture is expected to perform well due to high crop prices, strong farmer sentiment, and limited availability of new equipment driving aftermarket demand. Our municipal water business is stable. We see improved optimism in the market and project planning activities increasing. We are expecting an uptick in the energy and chemical markets. The North American mobile truck market is improving due to a strong construction market in home heating oil prices, and North American pipelines are reporting modest, increase capital budgets for 2022. We see international oil and gas quote activity outpacing domestic demand, an opportunity we are well-positioned to capitalize on. FMT continues to be in a strong position to realize price and we expect this to drive improved margins in 2022. Likewise, the projects we completed last year to optimize our cost position as well as new operational productivity projects will yield strong flow-through in 2022, tempered by a discretionary spending rebound and continued resource investment in the segment. Moving to the Health & Science Technology segment. We expect the strongest growth in HST of all our three segments, and we plan to make the largest resource investments in HST to support that growth. We anticipate margin improvement driven by volume leverage, parts -- partly offset by these resource additions. HST continues to have robust demand across all their major end markets; Semiconductor, Food and Pharma, Analytical Instrument -- Instrumentation, and Life Sciences are all expected to perform well. Next-gen sequencing instrument demand is growing with research and clinical applications outpacing COVID detection and surveillance. Our ability to execute in the current environment continues to distinguish us from our competition and improve our share position. On the Semiconductor side, we continue to capitalize on tailwinds generated from global broadband and satellite communication trends. In auto, supply chain issues at our customers, especially around semiconductors mute our growth. Underlying market demand remains favorable and we expect our results to imp rove a supply chain issues ease. The industrial businesses within the segment faced similar trends to FMT. Finally, we expect that our Fire & Safety Diversified Products segment will be our most challenge next year.  In Fire and Safety, North American OEMS are experiencing significant supply chain constraints around chassis and component availability, which limits their production. On the rescue side, we anticipate that larger tenders will lag compounded by China localization policies that are driving delays. We do not anticipate near-term easing of these conditions and see the potential for recovery towards the latter part of 2022. In our banded business, like in HST, we see auto supply chain issues dampening current demand. Despite this pressure, our business continues to outperform the broader market due to our content on key vehicle models. Lastly, in the near term, we expect continued momentum within our dispensing business as customer capital investments are deployed in early 2022. However, for the year, we will see a non-repeat of North America projects as we reach the end of the replenishment cycle this year, as composed to last year. We anticipate that the unfavorable price cost position we experienced last year will rebound this year as annual contracts are renewed at current pricing.  We see this improvement tempered a bit by some mix pressure as dispensing volumes reduced, and we make some targeted investments. To summarize, we see favorable conditions across the majority of our end markets. However, the degree to which our customers and our facilities will be impacted by rolling supply chain and COVID related disruptions remains highly variable. We'll continue to monitor conditions and be as prepared as we can be for potential interruptions. Despite the short-term headwinds, we are optimistic about our growth potential and the trajectory of our end markets. With that, I'd like to turn over to Bill to discuss our financial results. Bill Grogan : Thanks, Eric. I'll start with our consolidated financial results on Slide 9. Fourth quarter orders of $795 million were up 17% overall, and up 13% organically. Organic orders increased across each of our segments. For the year, orders were up 26% overall, and up 21% organically. We experienced a strong rebound in demand for our products across all our segments, and steadily built our backlog in each quarter of 2021 totaling $266 million for the year. Relative to full year 2019, organic orders were up 15%. Q4 sales of $715 million were up 16% overall, and up 11% organically. We experienced a strong demand rebound from 2020, but our results were tempered by supply chain and COVID production limitations. Full year sales of $2.8 billion were up 18% overall, and up 12% organically. We saw favorable results across all our segments and again, strong performance relative to full year 2019 with organic sales up 4%. Fourth-quarter gross margins expanded 20 basis points to 44%. For the full year, gross margins expanded 60 basis points and adjusted gross margins expanded 80 basis points to 44.7%, primarily driven by strong volume leverage. Q4 operating margin was 22.7%, up 10 basis points compared to prior year.  Adjusted operating margin declined 60 basis points driven by a rebound in discretionary spending, targeted resource investments, and the dilutive impact of acquisition-related intangible amortization, partially offset by volume leverage. Full-year operating margin was 23%, up 90 basis points compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 23.9%, up 110 basis points compared to prior year. I'll discuss the drivers of adjusted operating income on the next slide. Our fourth-quarter effective tax rate was 22.5% relatively flat compared to the prior year ETR of 22.2%. Our full-year effective tax rate was 22.5% compared to 19.7% in the prior year due to lower tax benefits associated with executive compensation and the non-repeat benefits associated with the finalization of the global intangible low-income tax regulations in 2020. Q4 net income was $119 million, which resulted in EPS of a $1.55. Adjusted net income was also a $119 million with adjusted EPS of a $1.55, which was up $0.18 or 13% over prior year adjusted EPS. Full-year net income was $449 million, which resulted in EPS of $5.88. Adjusted net income was $482 million, resulting in an adjusted EPS of $6.30 up $1.11 or 21 over prior year adjusted EPS.  The tax rate movement I mentioned drives a $0.23 differential in EPS as compared to the prior year. Said differently, our EPS would have expanded by a $1.34 or 26% had 2021 been taxed at the 2020 rate. Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $136 million, 115% of adjusted net income. For the year free cash flow was $493 million, down 5% versus last year, and was 102% of adjusted net income. This result was impacted by a volume-driven working capital build and higher CapEx, partially offset by our higher earnings. We spent over $70 million on capital projects this year, an increase of over $20 million versus 2020. Moving on to Slide 10, which details the drivers of our adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income increased $125 million for the year compared to 2020. Our 12% organic growth contributed approximately $106 million flowing through at our prior year gross margin rate. We levered well in this volume increase in our team's drove operational productivity to help mitigate the profit headwinds we experienced from increased supply chain costs and the associated inefficiencies.  Although we have maintained positive price cost for the year, inflation continues to ramp and we saw compressed price cost spread versus historic levels, which pressured our up-margin rate and flow-through percentages. The positive mix is primarily result of the portfolio and business mix normalizing to pre -pandemic levels that had a negative impact on our results last year. We reinvested $35 million back into the businesses, taking the form of a partial rebound in discretionary spending to pre -pandemic levels, higher variable compensation expenses, and targeted reinvestment in resources to drive growth. Despite this incremental spend and a challenging supply chain environment, we achieved a solid 38% organic flow-through for the year. Flow-through is then negatively impacted by the dilutive impact of acquisitions in FX, getting us to our reported flow-through of 30%. With that, I'd like to provide an update on our outlook for the first quarter and full-year 2022. I'm on Slide 11. As a reminder, going forward, we will be adjusting EPS for acquisition-related intangible amortization in both our guidance and results. Our fourth-quarter adjusted EPS under this definition would have been $1.71 per share, while our full-year 2021 adjusted EPS would have been $6.87 per share. Under this new definition for the first quarter of 2022, we are projecting GAAP EPS of $1.57 to $1.60 and adjusted EPS to range from $1.73 to $1.76. We expect organic revenue growth of 67% for the first quarter and operating margin of approximately 23%. Q1 expected results in cooperate headwinds arising from COVID driven absenteeism and supply chain production constraints. The first quarter effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 22.5%. We expect FX to be unfavorable to our top line by 1% and acquisitions to provide a 4% benefit. Corporate costs in the first quarter expected to be around $19 million. Turning to the full year 2022, we project GAAP EPS of $6.70 to $7 and adjusted EPS to range from $7.33 to $7.63. We expect full-year organic revenue growth of 5% to 8% and operating margins to be around 24%.  We expect FX to be unfavorable to our topline by 1% and acquisitions to provide a 2% benefit. The full year effective tax rate is expected to be around 22.5%. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be around $90 million, an increase over 2021 as we continue to identify opportunities to reinvest in our core businesses. Free cash flow is expected to be approximately 105% of adjusted net income and corporate costs are expected to be approximately $80 million for the year. Our earnings guidance excludes impacts from future acquisitions and any future restructuring charges. Nextsite is excluded from the figures above, as the transaction has yet to close. Next, I will provide some additional details regarding our 2022 guidance for the full year. I'm on Slide 12. On an operational basis, we expect supply chain constraints to mitigate our output for the first half of the year, muting an otherwise strong demand environment. Therefore, we are projecting organic revenue for the year to be up 5% to 8%, which translates to an EPS impact of $0.60 to $0.95 depending on the topline results. This range also assumes improving price cost. We continue to drive operational productivity across the portfolio and expect to see benefits from our 2021 restructuring actions.  This will drive $0.20 to $0.25 of favorability next year. We also continue to invest in the resources required to grow in the current year-end and beyond. These investments will reduce EPS by $0.20 to $0.25 and are funded by the productivity gains I mentioned previously. Our discretionary spend partially recovered to pre-pandemic levels in 2021 and we expect this spending to be fully recovered by the end of 2022. The unfavorability impacts EPS by 20 - $0.25. I will note that we're ramping spend to pre -pandemic levels, but with 20% higher revenues. ABEL has 1 partial quarter and Airtech has 2 quarters inorganic results included in our guidance. We expect acquisitions to contribute $54 million of revenue and $0.08 of EPS. The incremental amortization that we see in 2022 versus 2021 is largely related to these acquisitions and will provide an additional $0.05 of EPS. Now let's take a look at a couple of non-operational items. First, our guide assumes no impact from taxes are guided rate is flat year-over-year. Second, we expect a 1% headwind from FX, providing $0.07 of EPS pressure. So in summary, we are projecting organic revenue growth of 5% to 8% for the year. Adjusted EPS expectations on the range of $7.33 to $7.63, a 7% to 11% growth over 2021 implied in our guidance is mid to high 20s year-over-year flow-through on the low-end and 30% on the high end. With that, I'll throw it back to Eric for some final thoughts. Eric Ashleman : Thanks, Bill. I'm on the final slide, Slide 13. Before we open the call up for questions, I'd like to wrap up with a summary of our most critical 2022 focus areas. In an environment characterized by uncertainty and disruption, it's important not to lose sight of who we are as a company. First and foremost, we are a portfolio of great businesses that leverage 8020 with an obsessive focus to serve our customers. We refer to that simple model as the IDEX difference. We're committed to navigating the challenges of the short-term landscape, but remain focused on the longer term. We must continue to utilize our 8020 toolkits to create efficient, innovative, value-creating businesses. In a world with this level of variability, the simpler you are, the more successful you will be. We remain committed to investing in the resources needed so our businesses are poised to take advantage of the growth potential in front of us. We are a company committed to its core values and we'll continue to develop top-performing teams as part of an inspiring company culture. Diversity, equity, and inclusion continues to be an area of focus, creating environments where people feel they belong and are comfortable bringing their true selves to work every day. Our strong operating cash flow and balance sheet put us in a great position to continue to put capital to work, and we've already identified several high return organic investment opportunities across the company that will push us past our 2021 CapEx record levels. We have invested in new industrial automation that will improve efficiency and expand capacity for growth. We're supporting focus digitalization efforts are across our installed base to solidify our superior positions and expand share of wallet. Our facility expansions in China and India are well underway, effectively doubling future capacities to support growth across the. Lastly, our M&A opportunity pipeline continues to be strong, and we look forward to deploying additional capital in 2022, welcoming new businesses to the IDEX family. With that, let me pause and turn it over to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will begin docking a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Allison Poliniak : Hey, good morning. Eric, you had talked about projects lagging in the first half in FMT. Could you maybe give us the color in terms of your customer conversations? Are they -- the risks that this sort of gets delayed indefinitely at this point, just the urgency around getting some of these projects going? Just any thoughts around that? Eric Ashleman : Yeah, yeah. Good to talk Allison. So I mean, it's a bit of a continuation of the theme that we've seen now for a while as, there's plenty of confidence out there that there's lots of demand support to get things done. It is really difficult to do -- to just frankly bring together all the resources that you need to take a really complex project and take it from beginning to end. Lining up material, lining up resources, things like that. So what we are starting to see, frankly, are smaller to medium-sized versions of that. Slight expansions, things you can kind of do on the fly. And then continued staging for projects that are of those slightly larger incremental scale aspects, as people talk about that. I mean, quite honestly, it's the same thing that we're going through in our own business and we've got a couple of critical big projects that we've deployed they were really hard to put together. And then all over the place we're, while we're running doing those things that give you that little bit of 3% to 5% output let as we go. So I think that's really the nature of it. And of course, it varies depending on certain markets are further out ahead of that a little bit more positive some are lagging even further because they're just inherently involve larger chunks of infrastructure. But I was going to summarize it, I'd put it -- I'd describe it that way. Allison Poliniak : That's helpful. And then just -- the free cash flow guidance. You talked about CapEx and the increased spend there, which makes sense. I know working capital you showed some increases in '21. Should we expect a similar level at '22, just given the ongoing challenges that you guys are facing? Just trying to get some color on -- Bill Grogan : Allison, it's Bill. I think it tapered down a little bit, obviously, here and as we progressed through the year, a little bit of inventory build to support the higher revenue load, but I don't think it'll be as big of a build as we experienced last year. Our efficiency metrics are down a little bit, but some of that's just related to increased inventory to buffer extended lead times that we have across our vendor base. Allison Poliniak : Got it and I guess along with that, you guys are still on the message, but it's probably not a fair question. But are you guys kind of revisiting some of your processes in such to deal with some of these shocks that we have to go through at time-to-time. Just any thoughts on that. Eric Ashleman : Allison, you're asking about the supply chain shocks in general? Allison Poliniak : The supply chain shock, I mean, are you guys trying to think if things differently going forward just to kind of avert some of this stuff at the [Indiscernible]. Eric Ashleman : I mean, it's a great question, something we've revisited continuously as we go on through this. I mean, we are -- I think we're -- from a high level, we're positioned really, really well. I mean, we do a lot of local supply, close proximity with people that we've known for a long time. Deep relationships, a lot of trust there, very collaborative. So I like that topology. I don't think we would try to change it or move it farther away. And any, frankly, any change right now is difficult because everybody's bandwidth constricted. So, a couple of places we're looking at that, it's kind of at the sharpest reason why. We just -- we have to do something different and we've got resources allocated there. I will say the one thing we're spending a lot of time working on. And I mentioned in the opening comments is simplification. You can generally see are businesses that have done the most there, are frankly having the easiest time of it. We have a highly customized model at the company. And so that's always an inherent challenge for us. So I think one of the things we've learned here, and we've gotten better at as we've gone along, just trying to find a way to say, is there a simpler way to do it more modular, simpler design that's easier to reproduce against a given supply base that will probably stay pretty similar for us as we go forward. Allison Poliniak : Got it. Thanks so much. I will pass it along. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Mike Halloran : Good morning everyone. Kind of related to Allison 's first question early to tack onto it. When you think about some of the [Indiscernible] seeing on some of these CapEx decisions just because of bandwidth or you also put into the context of the supply chain challenges in everything seeming to linger a little bit longer than people were thinking. How do you think about the risk of demand degradation or at least pipeline degradation that could materialize related to all of those moving pieces? Eric Ashleman : Well, I mean, there's inherently always a little bit more risk as you extend things out than any other externality could jump into the mix and start to inflect decisions along the way. So I think that's there. I mean, as we've thought of the projects that we're working with -- when you consider a project across a long-term cycle, ones that feel the most assured about or where you can just see there's not enough capacity or there's a lot of labor challenges, these things aren't going to go away in the long-term. And when you see that condition, let's say if that's in a food market, that's somebody recognizing there's a lot of demand here, we're struggling to meet it, we know it's going to be there in the long run, while the projects themselves can be delayed and they keep extending, honestly, the conversations stay pretty active. The transfer documents and data and things is still going on, so you put those into a different category. The things that you can just tell are a little bit more susceptible to shocks, new technology, it's a launch, it's dependent upon certain conditions to be there, we probably put that in a slightly more variable category. But I honestly think over the long-term there's a lot more in the first that ultimately everybody would love to do if they could. And we've now seen, and certainly we've talked about before on this call, I think we're seeing the impact of not having it deployed as we tried to recover. From now, it just essentially at above levels that were sort of were here originally before the pandemic. Mike Halloran : That's super helpful. And then sticking with the concept of moving pieces and how you're thinking about guidance for the year. Obviously, you have these first-quarter challenges with absenteeism and everything else, and then the price cost curve and how that works itself out through the year in the context and everything. So when you think about the guidance specifically, both on the margin side as well as on the revenue side, how would you think about profitability versus call it a normal sequential curve through the year? Is it a little bit or sloped to normal? And best guess for when you think you can start getting to something more normalized and not necessarily saying back to '19 levels of smoothness, but at least more repeatable or a better understanding of what the process can look like? Bill Grogan : Hey Mike, it's [Indiscernible] some of that's to be determined how the year plays out but are -- what's implied in our guidance is, you will from a ramp as we progress through the year. It is obviously more weighted towards latter in the year but if you look at the second quarter, it's kind of a couple of percent ramp and output versus the first quarter and it has to hold there for the balance of the year. So relative to where we're at here and the challenges we have in the first quarter, there is an assumption that those were resolved. We do have some of the discretionary costs that have just built through 2021 that are in our current run rate for the second quarter. And as we ramp volume will lever on those incremental costs; I think you'll see our margin profile continue to expand sequentially as we progress through the year. Mike Halloran : So the point, Bill, is that, there's not a massive assumption that there's normalization through the year. There's a step-up on [Indiscernible] 2Q because there's some identifiable things that normalize out. But beyond that, it's a little bit more wait-and-see and pretty normal sequentials from [Indiscernible] 2Q [Indiscernible], right? Bill Grogan : Yes, as I said there's not some huge switch that needs to be flipped. I think we're comfortable with the ramp that we see here in the short-term. The second quarter seasonally always goes up for us, so we've got that on top of some of just the output relief, I think we'll get, and then it's, unless something created some headwind to decelerate, we should be in a reasonable position. Mike Halloran : Appreciate it, Bill. Thanks Eric. Eric Ashleman : Thanks Mike. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC, please proceed with your question. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Eric Ashleman : Hi, Dean. Deane Dray : I'd like to put the spotlight on these pockets of discretionary spending reinvestment, growth investment, if we could. So just so we're trued up. What was -- how much of that went into the fourth-quarter? So on slide ten, that $35 million did you kind of front-load any of that spending into the fourth-quarter or was that level throughout the year? Bill Grogan : No. Deane, it ramped throughout the year, I think Q3 and Q4. There's marginal increase in the fourth-quarter. We talked about that in Q3 call that some things had moved from Q3 to Q4. That's one of the issues we have with the first quarter, is just last year, we were still extremely diligent and then spend a whole heck of a lot and then ramped 2, 3, and 4. So there's a little bit of ramp here as we progress from Q4 to Q1, but it's not overly material. Deane Dray : Got it. And then on Slide 12 for year '22 bridge, you've got the two buckets growth investments, and discretionary spend rebound. I mean, collectively that $0.40 to $0.50 in your guide, they both feel a little bit discretionary by definition, right? Where and how is that being targeted? Is that level throughout the year? Is it contingency in any way? And what would be the expected returns that you would get on some of these growth investments? Thanks. Eric Ashleman : Sure. So a couple of things there. One, in general, the nature of this kind of spend, let's say today versus where it was three years ago, there are some differences. There's actually some productivity that we're all going to enjoy as we've learned how to work in different ways. Travel won't be as high as it ever was. Certainly, marketing and digital, ways to get messages out to customers, much more efficient than we've seen before. And so that's one of the reasons, even with the slight increases here in the ramp up, we're basically at a level we were three years ago with 400 million more dollars of sales in the Company. What it's targeted towards is a lot of our investments, frankly, it's people, and it's people on the front-end of business and the technology side of the business tied to the parts of the Company that we think have the most favorable wind at their backs in terms of our positioning in the end markets that they are sitting in. So we talked before about kind of the top 25 bets across IDEX, that list ebbs and flows from year-to-year, but about 2/3 of it holds constant. In many of the resources that are here, some ways they're identified a year, year-and-a-half ago. We let the last year play out. We're really careful with things, but at some point, you start to see that, hey, we've got some real momentum here. And the nature of people driving the investments, they've got to get in, they've got to learn the company, they've got to learn the markets and then start to add some value.  So I think the return, as it often is in anything we do when we're supporting organic growth, is really strong. On investments of that type because it's people dependent. It also makes it pretty easy to be careful with as you go forward. So as Bill said, if we start to see things all of a sudden take a turn or there's something that it comes into the mix that none of us expected. By nature, we can hold off, we can do more with less, we can ask people that we deployed towards other areas across IDEX. So I think what you're seeing here a little bit is probably we would have liked to have more of that onboard and a more of an even ramp through the year last year. Again, because a lot of its people, as everybody knows, it's hard to find. When you find them, I think you want to be careful and make sure you bring them on board when you can. That's part of the mix too. Deane Dray : That's real helpful. And then just in context of the building backlog, and I might have missed this, I apologize, did you -- can you calibrate how many in the way of revenues could not be shipped, either you didn't have the products on hand or customers weren't ready, so you got finished goods, but have you calibrated what that would have been? Bill Grogan : Yeah, we haven't. But in the fourth-quarter it's probably 3% to 5% organic that we could have had incrementally to what we delivered if we had full availability of parts and labor. Deane Dray : Got it. That's really helpful. And have you given the quick overview of Nextsite? It sounds like a really interesting addition to your water business. Eric Ashleman : Yeah. I mean, it's a business we've known for a long, long time, and we've partnered with them with our sewer robots franchise there. They've been kind of closer to the customer and a partner for us. Frankly, there are predominant partner over the years. So essentially they're going to market here in North America predominantly. They do a lot of things around sewer inspection, have a few other answered products that go with that. There's some tremendous software capability embedded within that business that's used in that space and we think has appropriation abilities elsewhere in the water technology area. And a couple of other interesting nascent extensions that they've launched that we also are interested in potentially opening a door for us. So it's a really nice fit for a partner that we've known for a long time. And it was just the time is right to bring them into the IDEX family. Deane Dray : Great. We're hearing lots and lots of focus on storm water from municipalities and there's just such a need right now and there's loss regulatory pressures as well fines that will be imposed on municipalities that they don't address it, so hot area and nice to see that investment. Thank you. Eric Ashleman : Compliance is a driver for our businesses in that space. Yes. Deane Dray : Thank you. Eric Ashleman : Thanks Deane. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question. Rob Wertheimer : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So my question is a pretty simple one. You had positive price cost in two segments, negative in Fire Safety, and maybe some of the distinctions are obvious there, but could you just kind of walk through the pace of how things flow through on pricing changes. If it's all due to that, if there's any inherent pricing power differentials, that'd be helpful too, but maybe just talk through the dynamics and what you do there. Thank you. Bill Grogan : Sure. So the dynamics of price cost is obviously, it varies across the portfolio between the segments and the businesses. Holistically, FMT's are strongest price cost relative to a lot of their business goes through channel our ability to move price through there is favorable. Obviously, they've got more exposure to heavy casting metal, motor inflation but they have the power to offset at HSPs which were OEM focused. So there's opportunities but more on an annual basis on that side of it, and the stuff that looks like the FMT, the industrial parts of it, similar dynamics. FSD has been the challenge, primarily in our Fire and Rescue businesses. We talked about the flare OEM challenges and the large backlogs that they're sitting on in excess of 12 months to 18 months. And what we've priced that on, we haven't been able to re-price it. So we continue to work through the lower-margin profile on that through the back half of the year and most likely through the first half of this year. They've gone out with significant price increases here recently on any of the annual contracts that they have.  So they are poised for a large recovery and margin improvement as we progress through the year, but still challenged in the first half. Dispensing this fairly strong [Indiscernible] relative to their steel exposure and their automotive and aerospace customer base, they were challenged as well. So they were significantly under on the price cost, weighing down the overall organization, but a lot of good effort from the teams to manage through it. And I think are much better positioned as we stand here today to progress through the rest of the year. Rob Wertheimer : Okay that's helpful. And is there anything, sort of structural changing on how you think about those long lead times backlogs and how you price? And then just one more quick one on Macron, you mentioned sick outs, which is universal expos on 1Q. Is that all requested in savings so that you're until the next wave you see the risk continued to 1Q or maybe January, February, and I'll stop there. Thank you. Eric Ashleman : Yes, Rob. So the nature of pricing, I mean, I will say I think we and everybody else are looking at the historical ways that long-term pricing has been done and are finding ways to make sure that we've got more opportunities for investment along the way. As you suspect that given that the pressure and volume and it's just the nature of that space that's probably going to take a while, but that is in the mix in terms of innovation in different ways to handle it. On the virus, I'd say we're plateaued slight decrease, but we're such a -- we've got such a global topography that is, it decreases in one area and comes up and another one, so I'd say it's level right now not increasing anywhere but still at a higher rate than we've seen in any of the other episodes that have come across. Rob Wertheimer : Thank you Eric Ashleman : Thanks, Rob. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Nathan Jones : Good morning everyone. Eric Ashleman : Hi, Nathan. Nathan Jones : Wanted to start with a couple of questions following up on Deane's line on the growth in discretionary spend rebound. Those are really the two large buckets in 2022 that are dragging the incremental down from the level that we would normally expect from IDEX. Specifically, you guys said that your back to 2019 investment levels, on $400 million more revenue, IDEX has always been a big investor in growth, does that mean that we should expect potentially more incremental growth investments in 2023 or are you able to leverage those growth investments better? And do you think it's a one-year ramp up? And I assume the discretionary spend rebounded is probably anticipated to be back to normal levels by the end of 2022? Eric Ashleman : Yeah. I mean, again, because of the nature kind of our model and what those investments usually are in terms of people. I mean, to be honest, there's a bandwidth limit on the upper side that also governed some of this. These are not the kind of businesses where you can just endlessly pull people in there and it all works better. These are super, super targeted around and aligned highly to the best that we're talking about. And then sort of everything else, we leverage a lot of that productivity to actually support those investments and run the company that way. It's a pretty consistent level, so I really do think of this more along the lines of rebuilding a basic base to fuel growth of the company in the highly targeted way that we do it more than let's say a next chapter of spend profiling for the company. We don't need to do that. Nathan Jones : So long-term I think you guys have always talked about when you were at low single-digit, you get 35% incremental margins, maybe getting to 40% if you got mid-to-high single-digit organic growth nothing has changed structurally in that outlook over the long-term wages in a period of bringing investments back up there a period of under investment boast on new by COVID. Bill Grogan : Exactly. Nathan, I think you're pointing to discretionary. Is that being somewhat of a catch-up here as we progress through the last two years that will fall off, there will be nominal increases on that going forward. And then as Eric said, it's our normal investment profile. So if you normalize for the discretionary ramp, we're at our traditional mid-30s type of flow-through. Nathan Jones : Okay, just wanted on capital deployment record level of acquisition spending in 2021, but you still have reached paper problems over there in -- under-levered balance sheet. And it would take several years of spending that record level of capital on acquisitions. to get you into a more optimal balance sheet structure. Is the pipeline robust enough and are there enough opportunities at the right prices out there for you to look to deploy similar amount of capital in '21 as we go for whatever the next few years Eric Ashleman : Yeah, Nathan. I mean, that's exactly the target and the expectation here. I mean, we talked, I know for the last several quarters, about the intentionality we've put on this. Some of the investments in resources are focused in this particular area because they have to be. The achievements that we made in '21 I think was a direct result as they're all high-quality. I can assure you we looked at a lot more than those companies to get the ones that we brought in on the board, and that's the way we're thinking of it going forward. We'll consider evaluations will be high, competition will be fierce, and we have to make sure we get plenty of that vast as we go at it and hold our discipline at the same time. But we talked our ideal spot here would begin to lever load at this high, and the minimum is higher level of deployment that actually helps you build a more uniform resource basis to do the work. We're always looking for the potential to expand it. If in fact we can do that efficiently, manage the change across the company. So it is definitely an intentional travel to a higher level? Yes. Nathan Jones : Thanks very much for taking my questions. Eric Ashleman : Thanks, Nathan. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson, please proceed with your question Matt Summerville : Thanks. Given some of the pluses and minuses you talked about with respect to the margins as we progress through the year across the segments, how should we be thinking about the incremental margin at the segment level relative to the full-year guidance range you talked about, Bill, at the high-end, low-end. Can you give a little more color there? Bill Grogan : Obviously, our first quarter is going to look fairly similar to the fourth-quarter. With ramp, I think you're going to see margin profile improve on a basis point perspective, more in FMT, as probably our highest margin improvement as -- well, obviously, we had the challenges within the FMD business this year with the CapEx reduction and then being significantly lower from a volume perspective. We had several site consolidations and the incremental costs associated with that. And then just that business levers extremely well as they progress, so I would say, FMT margins building throughout the year, HST still extremely strong but moderated relative to a lot of the investments we're making are on that side of the house. And then FSD recovering on the price cost side being a primary driver of their margin improvement for the full year with pressure here in the first half like I mentioned earlier with Rob's question. Matt Summerville : And then just as a follow-up, just to be clear. How much price you anticipate achieving in '22 versus maybe what you achieved in '21? Thank you. Bill Grogan : So more, I mean last year we were about 200 basis points and we will be in excess of that here in 2022. Matt Summerville : Got it. Thank you. Bill Grogan : Sure Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Birenberg, please proceed with your question. Andrew Buscaglia : Good morning, guys. More into -- little bit more into your HSD segment. In that your guidance does imply some pretty decent growth despite really tough comps this year. So I'm wondering what exactly in there I mean, we really lapping, I think tough comps in semis in life sciences and it sounds like [Indiscernible] could be source of upside, but are there other areas that just haven't recovered that are really where there's a lot of juice left. Eric Ashleman : I don't know that the story is really that one where it's folks coming off the pandemic map or something like that. I mean, these are just inherently strong sectors that we think are going to continue, which we've seen good -- good ramping in '21 and it's honestly it's market dynamics that are going to drive it in '22. So the Pharma space which you didn't mention, that is a really good space. Now we participate there, we make vaccines more effective. As you can imagine, that's going really well. That's where we're seeing some of the medium-term capital projects. It's focus, sometimes not the biggest ones, but these smaller to medium projects to get expansion out there. That's an area where we're seeing a lot of that. Our optical technologies businesses are really well-positioned for some great applications and broadband access and coming down from space and things that are really out there. And then I would say just stuff right down the middle of the fairway is really good for us.  Next-gen sequencing, of course, there's all of the growth aspects, they were always there as part of that space but, let's be honest, all this COVID surveillance and variant identification, that's the year that's doing it across the world. So this is just -- this is a story of strong markets who are well-positioned and they continue to be needed more than ever, more than it is in any way a recovery aspect. I mean, again, I always remind people there's some industrial businesses in there that might have more FMT -like aspects, but for what -- I think the spirit of the question is, the heart of it, it's a continuation in the theme that we think is going to continue. Andrew Buscaglia : Okay. And a similar question though, I think FMT and probably IDEX seem that kind of have -- it seemed to be somewhat influenced by energy in that EBITDA, even though it may not be a direct exposure, it's this indirect impact, which now it seems to be kind of more topical. Very coming back we think. So what about you sent in maybe in FMT within energy recovery helping that business maybe exceed your expectations. What are your thoughts there? Eric Ashleman : Well, I mean so a couple of things. Energy in general, I mean, it's our single-digit exposure there is localized largely in FMT. That is a story of recovering off of pandemic loss. No doubt because of commodity pricing and some other things and just delayed investments. It's a little different than it was 2, 3 years ago, but it's positive and that'll help. And you're also right, it's always hard to identify, but no doubt there are derivative impacts of that sector in terms of just the up and down the street industrial businesses that are throughout FMT. So we do think we have that factored in the mix, but to the extent any of that over achieved. That's the area that we'd see upside. Andrew Buscaglia : Okay. Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley, please proceed with your question. Connor Lynagh : Yeah, thank you. I was wondering if we could return to the capital allocation question and particularly the step-up in M&A allocation that you're targeting over the next couple of years. I'm wondering if you can frame -- are there any specific end markets that you see as you look at the pipeline right now, where you're overweight, underweight? How do you overlay a view on end markets and cycles to that framework? Eric Ashleman : It probably doesn't map as cleanly as you might imagine, because I mean, when we think about the markets that we're going after, they are often defined by niche applications sets. And so you can see those in any one of our three segments, and in some ways they might even strike you as counter intuitive. In general, we're obviously looking in areas that we think have more fundamental growth tailwinds behind them, and so a lot of it just would be exactly where you think it would. Lots of focus in the HST world, lots of focus, as we've just seen here, in water technology and spaces like that. But there are some great industrial franchises that have done a great job of targeting into certain application spaces that make a lot of sense too, that are sitting in places you might not otherwise think. The two other examples in '21 are actually great examples of that. Apple Pumps, for example, tied to mining as one of its core markets. That's actually really attractive now, because of all the mining that's going on to support alternative energy applications.  Then you look at Airtech, which from far away looks like kind of just an industrial compression business or blower business, and yet they've tuned very nicely to some alternative energy applications as well. So it really does, it plays out at that kind of specific work to be done. And then how well that lines up often to a high-level macro trend, but we very quickly kind of bring that down into the niche kind of environments that we're comfortable with and we could see that across any one of our overall segments. Connor Lynagh : Got it. Maybe switching gears a little bit here, you mentioned labor being a constraint. I am just curious, is some of the increase in costs you're targeting related to outright increases in wages, or you are just saying availability is more the issue? How are you thinking about that as we move through 2022 here? Eric Ashleman : So a couple of things there I mean, I always remind people we have a pretty light intensity in terms of labor. It's important, but it's not a huge driver in our P&L that being said, I think everybody expects a little bit more wage inflation we have is well here this year. To be honest, we probably see more of it tangibly in terms of premium costs and things that we're doing with the existing basis. We're scrambling to try to make things on Saturdays or Fridays in a disruptive manner, here today. So it so it matters for us but it's not a massive driver on the P&L. It is a driver, of course as it comes in and supply components where that same dimension is applying to businesses outside. So it's certainly were not immune to it. We kind of acted with pricing, price capture on the top and manage it that way. Connor Lynagh : Understood. Thanks for the color. Eric Ashleman : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research, please proceed with your question. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Eric Ashleman : Morning. Jeff Sprague : Couple from me if I could. Just first on FMT. The segment color you provided in the appendix at the annual headwind from Flow MD, was it also headwind in Q4 or is that business now stabilized? Bill Grogan : Yes. It's fairly neutral in Q4, I think their current run rate now bottomed out in the third quarter and we see progression as we progress -- as we go over the next couple of quarters. Jeff Sprague : And then on Nextsite, could you just provide a little bit of color on the expected accretion, and also just a little modeling guidance on what we should expect on the amortization that comes into the adjusted EPS equation as a result. Bill Grogan : Jeff, once we close we'll add that to the guide. We have said it's a $50 million business with about 20% EBITDA margins, to frame it out a little bit for you, and then we'll nail it down once we close later this quarter and include it in our revised guidance in April. Jeff Sprague : Great. And then just finally, just back to labor. Appreciate that additional color. Could you just size it though, roughly as a percent of COGS? The cost of labor. Bill Grogan : And Eric prefers our direct labor, so things directly associated with the product builds about 7% or 8%. Jeff Sprague : Right, thanks for the caller. I appreciate it. Bill Grogan : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vlad Bystricky with Citigroup, please proceed with your question. Vlad Bystricky : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my call. So just -- I just wanted to go back to your comments on capacity constraints and lead times. I think during 3Q you talked about some extended lead times, but also said that you felt you were pretty well-positioned competitively versus others in the industry. Can you just give us an update or comment on how you think you're performing versus key competitors across the portfolio, and whether there's any specific businesses where you think you're more challenged versus peers? Eric Ashleman : I appreciate the question. I mean, this is something you have to kind of gauge every single business one-by-one. So we do that when we're talking with them and when we go out there. I mean, our model is generally is always designed to be more reactive and quicker than almost any competitor we have. That's why we have local supply and all the things that we've talked about here. I would say from a performance perspective, probably just like everybody else where we're most challenged just inherently are those places that are more electronics specific where we're dependent on that probably most constraining single commodity that everybody is customized, it's very hard to scramble and get something different. Things like spun boards and those things. Now, the people we're competing against, they've got the same electronic content that we do. So I don't see that as a net competitive disadvantage.  There is a great example there frankly in that space where I know we outperformed our dispensing business had really, really strong back half push. It's some of the most electronic intensive products that we have in the entire company they did a phenomenal job largely because their suppliers are very local and it's done a great job simplifying the architecture over time. So they go down the list, don't see too many places where folks are pointing to conversion and suppliers that are beating us. For a couple of dimensions, I do think we performed very, very well. It's frustrating right now, but I think we're still in a good spot. We're super well-positioned and a lot of what goes into an IDEX solution, it's customized nature, the long history of it. There's kind of a natural defense that's part of it. Vlad Bystricky : Okay. That's really helpful color. And then just maybe one more from me. Just going back to the CapEx ramp that you're expecting again here in '22. Can you talk about where you're seeing the best opportunities to deploy this capital, is it not mainly in areas like automation for productivity and then how should we think about this ramp? Is it reflective of some chunkier onetime things, or is this a more sustainable level of time? Eric Ashleman : Well, there's definitely a piece of it in there that's a little chunky in our nature because it's related to facility expansion that we have talked about here for the emerging markets. I mean, we're simultaneously effectively doubling capacity over there to support growth at costs all of Asia, that we wouldn't do all the time. I will say though that it is stepped up a bit as things like industrial automation becomes more important for companies like us and others. There are not too many places you can go automate away from people standing on a production for in our environment, but where there are, it's quite cost-effective to deploy that technology, and we're doing it more than we have before. There's some great CapEx related to supporting growth in some interesting ways, digitalization as a chapter is something that wouldn't have been in there 10 years ago or 20 years ago, it is a chapter now. So I think it's a fairly typical profile, certainly reasonable capacity expansion, you'd expect given the growth that we had last year and we project to have in the future, but there are a couple of these extra chapters in there. One sort of onetime-related to facility, but I think the other ones will become part of the mix as we go forward. Vlad Bystricky : Great, that's really helpful thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Mizuho America. Please proceed with your question. Brett Linzey : Thanks. And good morning, everyone. I wanted to come back to the wins you called out in Life Sciences and Semiconductor. Are the Life Science wins COVID -related or something outside that spectrum? And I was hoping you could put a finer point on how IDEX might be positioned with some of this forthcoming capacity build-out within Semiconductor. Any quantification be great too. Eric Ashleman : Okay, well, a few things there. So from a life science perspective, certainly the lingering nature of COVID, it's in the mix, but I wouldn't say it's the predominant driver anywhere. We talked about Next-Gen Sequencing and variance surveillance that's a part of it, but it's not the majority by any means. It still comes back to quick cancer detection, point-of-care medicine. I mean, broader trends that have long been important and are even more important as we get more focused on healthcare. So I really don't see the current pandemic as being a significant driver. This is really broad-based and we think has a lot room to run for us in that space. On the Semi side, that's interesting. I mean, we actually participate in two places there in the classic infrastructure build-out. So we're -- we do that and attack it from the ceiling perspective. So actually, manufacturing things, we're part of that process. And then on the optical side, we do more of it on the metrology and after-production quality side of it. So we see it from two angles. And in terms of its run out, as you might suspect here, we've got a long way to go until capacity comes to where it needs to be for that particular sector. There's things still just being announced now that we're all seeing that are exciting for all of us. So we think that's going to continue for quite a while and most of it is located in our HST segment, our exposure. Brett Linzey : Thanks for that and other question on orders and other strong year and really finish to 21. Just curious, as your teams drill down on the order book, are there any signs of double ordering in any of the businesses are pull-forward as customers try to secure a spot in line. Any color would be great. Eric Ashleman : Yeah, I think it's a small percentage mainly because of the kind of highly customized nature of what we make. That's kind of a risky bet in your -- everybody is [Indiscernible] on capacity that may or may not come around again just because of the way that we attack it with the products and the kind of product structure that we have. So it's typically not a high level, it's barely anything most days. I think we've pointed to it could be a percentage point at the current levels. I think that's pretty consistent. There's for high-volume things that people going depend on. There's probably a little bit of that, but it's not the majority of what we do here. It never has been. Brett Linzey : Okay. Great. Appreciate it. Eric Ashleman : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Loop Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Scott Graham : Good morning, Eric, Bill, Allison. Eric Ashleman : Hi, Scott. Scott Graham : So let me just ask the harder one first then line that up for Bill. So I'm looking at the FMT margin in the quarter we were down essentially 180 basis points, whereas in the third quarter, we were up over 100 basis points, and the contribution this quarter from ABEL, revenue-wise with less. And it looks like FMT -- FMD had a less negative impact on sales in the fourth-quarter than the third, so why was the FMT margin down that much? Bill Grogan : Sequentially Q3 -- or Q4 to Q3? Scott Graham : No, year-over-year. Well both of course right, but -- Bill Grogan : I would say two things if you normalized -- so just year-over-year, if you normalize FMT and take out FMD and ABEL, you're roughly flat on that margin perspective. I think from a quarter three to quarter four, there is a couple of things. One, FMT less working days in some of the vertically integrated businesses, so they have less absorption, which is seasonal, happens in most years. We had the final costs associated with the facility consolidations that weighed a little bit on their margins in the third quarter, and then just some premium over time and freight at the end of the year to get some stuff out for customers was dilutive, so. Those three things on the sequential piece and year-over-year, it's really the ex - FMD and ABEL that's pressuring the margins. Scott Graham : And this is not an acceleration in supply chain issues there? Bill Grogan : No. Scott Graham : Okay. Great. Thanks. The second question is more for you, Eric and I -- Bill was kind enough to share with us the -- what the supply chain held you back on organically to 5%, and it doesn't look like you're expecting much difference in your second half organic than your first. Just wondering how you're thinking about that 3% to 5% in the fourth quarter and how it affects your first half versus second half thinking. Doesn't that lessen in the second half of the year and, therefore, maybe you're being conservative on implied second half guide? Eric Ashleman : Yes. I mean, well, so a couple of things. I mean, I think we are definitely having a frame in a view that Q4 was tougher in a lot of regards because of the things that Bill talked about in terms of if you put some boundaries around it. Clearly, we have we have more absenteeism here than we've seen in any other point in the year, and we know the same thing was happening in suppliers, in logistic networks and those things. And to the extent that we see that same trend lagging over to the first quarter we've extended it there. We're making certain assumptions here as we go forward. One, we always get a seasonal uptick in our business. There's certain businesses that just this is the quiet as time for them because they can't do their work outside. We know those come online. Not all of those are labor dependent anyways or supplier-driven. There's things like that are out there. And then look, we're already seeing some signs that this current wave is going to subside come down. We are seeing more evidenced that people are wanting to get back into the workforce. So those pieces as well, and it's always easier to run the place when it's warmer out. So the few things in there and I don't think the ramp is so significant that it sort of stands in the way of those expectations. Scott Graham : Good color. Thank you both. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen & Company, please proceed with your question. Michael Kendal : Good morning. This is Michael and us to see in for Joe. Eric Ashleman : Hi, Michael. Michael Kendal : Thanks for the color on Nextsite. You mentioned sales would be roughly $50 million annually. What percentage is from the software component? Is there a portion that is recurring in nature? Eric Ashleman : Well, I mean, it's an interesting thing because it's embedded in a lot of the products. So it wouldn't be as identifiable as that, like it's for purpose definable piece. It's an extension of capabilities that's then realized in the products that we go-to-market with, but we love that capability. Michael Kendal : Great. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks. Eric Ashleman : Okay. Well, thank you all for joining the call today appreciate the questions as we went through in the interest in IDEX. Just a couple of things to frame it all out. No doubt, tough environment out there for everyone, as we've seen in talked about, I mean the IDEX model in some ways doesn't make that any easier. We've got a lot of iterative in innovation and customization short lead times as a standard expectation. High reliance on value-added suppliers. I put a but in here that's important. That also strengthened us for the short and the long term. I mean, we're an agile company. We're creative, we solve problems very quickly on the fly, and that supply chain that we're dependent upon. As I said a few times here today, it's very close to home. We've known those folks for a long time and there are deep relationships and trust there, a mutual trust. So that's a huge asset for us all that comes together.  So we're going to attack the current situation and deliver our performance and continue to do our best year in the months ahead but we also want to do that and not lose sight of what we're building ultimately for the future and I'm glad we had a chance to talk about that as well. We're going to strengthen the growth prospects that we have in our most advantaged verticals through organic and inorganic efforts going to use the balance sheet to go do that and support it. We're going to continue to optimize the footprint of the company we've done some great work over the last few years to build these more simple, scalable outposts out there that for IDEX, we've stripped out a lot of complexity that's going to lever really, really well for us, in terms of supporting growth and driving financials. And then lastly, we're going to inspire supported all with, I think a very inspiring culture that strides to expand the impact of our mission, which is trusted solutions, improving lives. So thanks for your time today, I wish you all a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Allison Lausas, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer. You may begin. Allison Lausas : Good morning, everyone. This is Allison Lausas, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for IDEX Corporation. Thank you for joining us for the discussion of IDEX first quarter 2022 financial highlights. Last night, we issued a press release outlining our company\u2019s financial and operating performance for the 3 months ending March 31, 2022. The press release, along with the presentation slides to be used during today\u2019s webcast, can be accessed on our company website at idexcorp.com. Joining me today are Eric Ashleman, our Chief Executive Officer and President; and Bill Grogan, our Chief Financial Officer. The format for our call today is as follows : we will begin with Eric providing an overview of the state of IDEX\u2019s business; then Bill will discuss IDEX first quarter financial results. He\u2019ll also give an update on segment performance and the markets they serve and provide our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2022. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. If you should need to exit the call for any reason, you may access a complete replay, beginning approximately 2 hours after the call concludes, by dialing the toll-free number 877-660-6853 and entering conference ID 13724803 or simply log on to our company homepage for the webcast replay. And before we begin, a brief reminder, this call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbor language in last night\u2019s press release and in IDEX\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I\u2019ll now turn this call over to our CEO and President, Eric Ashleman. Eric Ashleman : Thank you, Allison, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m on Slide 6. The first quarter was an outstanding start to the year for IDEX. I\u2019d like to thank our IDEX employees around the globe for their hard work and contributions to our success. We saw strong broad-based demand for our differentiated technologies with growth across all 3 of our segments leading to record orders, sales and backlog. This robust market plus outstanding operating performance resulted in 12% organic sales growth and excellent margins. We achieved adjusted EPS of $1.96, setting another IDEX record. Overall, the operating environment in the first quarter was much like the fourth quarter of 2021, but our team\u2019s improved their ability to navigate through this challenging environment. We effectively mapped our 80s and 20s from customers through work cells [ph] and back to the supply base in a way that increased overall throughput and velocity. We also work together to attack our most problematic supply challenges through resourcing or to redesign. Although, we expect these challenges will remain with \u2013 for us in the near term, we are confident in our ability to adapt, execute and deliver for our customers. This period of rapid economic recovery coupled with geopolitical disruptions and constrained supply continues to drive material and freight costs higher. We kept pace with our own robust price capture efforts as we leverage the highly differentiated nature of IDEX\u2019s product portfolio and our leadership positions in critical niche markets around the world. We also saw strong benefits from our productivity initiatives, specifically benefits from our site consolidations in FMT, capital investments that drove efficiencies, and product design changes that reduce material consumption. The results in Q1 are a testament to our team\u2019s long view across business cycles as they build productivity roadmaps to support growth and margin expansion. Turning to capital deployment, M&A continues to be a key priority for us. We recently announced our intent to acquire KZValve, a leading manufacturer of electric valves and controllers. This acquisition will extend our expertise in providing OEMs with critical solutions for precision agricultural and industrial applications, and serve as a complement to our agriculture business within FMT. We\u2019re excited to welcome KZValve to IDEX. We also closed on Nexsight, a compliment to our FMT water platform. Our funnel is strong and we continue to build conviction and interest around faster growing areas that complement the IDEX style of competition. Roopa Unnikrishnan, who joined us in March, will be an outstanding addition to these efforts, as she leads Strategy and Corporate Development for the company. Also, in the first quarter, we deployed $28 million to repurchase approximately 148,000 shares of company stock. We employ a discipline methodology to create long-term value for shareholders, when we see a break between our intrinsic assessment of IDEX enterprise value and our public valuation. Finally, we continue to make reasonable and modest resource investments to drive long-term sustainable growth. These investments typically involve incremental additions to our commercial and engineering resources to support our best organic bets, or targeted resources to support our inorganic efforts through M&A. With that, let me turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results. William Grogan : Thanks, Eric. I\u2019ll start with our consolidated financial results on Slide 8. Q1 orders of $856 million were up 20% overall and up 16% organically. We experienced favorable performance across all our segments and built $105 million of backlog. First quarter sales of $751 million were up 15% overall and up 12% organically. We saw favorable performance within each of our segments led by strong results in HST. Q1 gross margin expanded 70 basis points and adjusted gross margins expanded 60 basis points versus last year at 45.6% driven by favorable volume leverage, operational productivity and favorable price cost, despite rising inflation. First quarter operating margin was 25%, up 110 basis points compared to prior year. Adjusted operating margin was also 25%, up 70 basis points compared to prior year. Excluding the impact of acquisition-related intangible amortization, adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points. I\u2019ll discuss the drivers about adjusted operating income on the next slide. Our Q1 effective tax rate was 22.4%, down slightly versus our prior year rate of 22.6% due to the mix of global pre-tax income among their jurisdictions. First quarter net income was $140 million, which resulted in EPS of $1.83. Adjusted net income was $150 million, resulting in an adjusted EPS of $1.96, up $0.34 or 21% over prior year adjusted EPS. Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $64 million, approximately 43% of adjusted net income. This result is driven by higher earnings being more than offset by increases in working capital due to the volume impact on receivables, as well as additional inventory we\u2019ve strategically added to help mitigate some of the longer lead times we are experiencing. Moving on to Slide 9, which details the drivers of our adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income increased $29 million for the quarter compared to the prior year. Our 12% organic growth contributed approximately $25 million flowing through with our prior year gross margin rate. We levered well on the volume increase had strong price capture, and our team\u2019s drove operational productivity to offset the profit headwinds we experienced from inflation. Additionally, we saw benefits from our FMT site consolidations, and non-repeat of prior year inventory reserves associated with COVID-19 related new product development. Mix was not a significant driver of this quarter. We reinvested $4 million mainly in the form of engineering, commercial and M&A resources to enhance our long-term growth capabilities. Lastly, discretionary spending increased by $4 million versus last year. COVID-related constraints remained in place for a portion of the first quarter, limiting our spending. As we noted in our full year guidance, we expect discretionary to continue to ramp up as we progress through the year and restore to our normal pre-pandemic spend base, although on significantly higher sales. Our organic flow through was a solid 35% for the quarter. Flow through was then negatively impacted by the dilutive impact of acquisitions and FX, getting us to our reported flow through of 29%. With that, I\u2019ll provide a deeper look at our segment performance. I\u2019m on Page 10. In our Fluid & Metering Technologies segment, we experienced a strong first quarter for both orders and sales with organic growth of 14% and 11%, respectively. FMT adjusted operating margin expanded by 300 basis points versus last year, driven by strong volume leverage and operational productivity, which includes benefits from our energy and Italy site consolidation projects, non-repeat of prior inventory reserve adjustments, and some offset from resource investments. Our industrial day rates were strong. Customers do remain cautious around larger projects though, but we have seen some projects come through in the oil and gas, and petrochemical markets. Agriculture continues to perform well to the strong global crop demand and higher prices. Our municipal water business is stable, though, project activity is increasing. States are actively submitting applications for infrastructure bill funding, and there is general optimism for funding availability in the second half of the year. We see potential for larger spending in the long-term, and we are well positioned to capture this demand. Our energy business continues to improve. Higher oil and home-heating fuel prices are providing support and funnel activity is increasing, as global energy supply volatility is expected to drive higher U.S. production. Domestic pipeline companies continue to communicate increased cutbacks, but there is some lag due to supply chain constraints in the Russia-Ukraine uncertainty. Moving on to Health & Science Technology. We experienced excellent commercial performance with orders up organically 21% and organic sales up 16%. HST adjusted operating margin contracted by 40 basis points versus the first quarter of 2021, but expanded by 90 basis points excluding the impact of incremental amortization tied to the Airtech acquisition. This was driven by strong volume leverage, partially offset by increased discretionary spending and resource investments. HST continues to benefit from strong secular growth trends within life sciences, analytical instrumentation, semicon, and the food and pharma markets. Life sciences continues to experience strong demand due to an overall awarded focused around healthcare in areas such as point-of-care and patient diagnostics, as well as increased next-gen sequencing demand as the market for cell-based therapies expands and applications like cancer research. On the semiconductor side, we continue to see broad-based growth tied to wafer production and quality inspection. Other growth areas include optics applications and additive manufacturing, as well as broadband satellite technology. Finally, turning to our Fire, Safety and Diversified Products segment. This segment posted favorable orders and sales performance with organic growth of 12% and 5%, respectively. FSD adjusted operating margin contracted by 340 basis points versus last year. This was driven by higher employee related cost and discretionary spending, as well as pressure on price costs due to longer term OEM contracts on the fire side, and automotive exposure with high metal content and BAND-IT. We have taken action to address this gap and expect that price costs will improve in the second half of the year. Our dispensing business continues to experience strong results driven by North American project volume and overall positive global paint market. Our BAND-IT business performed well with industrial and energy demand more than offsetting lags in automotive driven by supply chain related customer delays. Within Fire & Safety, we are seeing core North American and European markets improving, but still challenge due to supply chain. North American fire OEMs continue to experience supply chain constraints flowing their order to revenue conversion cycle. With that, I would like to provide an update on our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2022. I\u2019m on Slide 11, which lays out our updated guidance. For the second quarter of 2022, we\u2019re projecting organic revenue growth of 8% to 9% and operating margin between 23% and 23.5%. Q2 forecasted op margin is lower sequentially due to a full quarter of Nexsight, which is diluted to our operating margin by approximately 50 basis points due to intangible amortization, as well as increased resource investment and discretionary spending. We expect GAAP EPS to range from $1.69 to $1.74, and adjusted EPS to range from $1.85 to $1.90. Turning to the full year. Given our strong first quarter performance, but potential risk and uncertainty on the back half of the year, we are raising the low-end and holding the high-end of organic growth and adjusted EPS guidance. We now expect full year organic revenue growth of 6% to 8%, which does not imply significant sales ramp from the second half of the year rather we are applying a normal seasonal pattern to our current output level. At this time, we see potential risks that further revenue acceleration may be tempered by the Russia-Ukraine war and supply chain effects related to the China\u2019s Zero-COVID policy. We will continue to monitor the situation and reassess our guidance range in the next quarter\u2019s update. We expect GAAP EPS to range between $6.87 to $7, and adjusted EPS to range from $7.50 to $7.63. Our operating margin expectations for the full year to be approximately 24% and is diluted by Nexsight intangible amortization of about 50 basis points. With that, let me pause and turn it over to the operator for your questions. Operator : And at this time, we\u2019ll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Michael Halloran : Hey, good morning, everyone. Eric Ashleman : Hi, Mike. Michael Halloran : Hey there, Eric. So maybe just start on the demand side of things. Obviously, there\u2019s a lot going on the environment here. But sounds like demand still pretty healthy order. It\u2019s still pretty healthy underneath the hood for you, I know, you mentioned in the prepared remarks maybe some hesitancy on the larger project side of things. But I\u2019d like to a little sense for how you\u2019re thinking about how those challenges from a broader perspective are impacting the business from the demand perspective. Are you seeing any cracks emerging anywhere? How was momentum through the quarter? Just really any context you can give around what you\u2019re seeing? Eric Ashleman : Yeah, thanks, Mike. Look, it\u2019s holding pretty steady for us all over the place. I mean, the sectors we outline have been strong, they were strong through the first quarter that momentum has continued into the early part here the second quarter. Probably the only thing that we\u2019ve seen continually here that it\u2019s been held back a bit is the large projects category that we talk about a lot. I continue to see that, honestly, it\u2019s just a question of resource availability, ability to focus on doing the work, either in the current context or even projecting across the future as people consider all the things that that are on the table there that could disrupt that. That being said, we\u2019ve seen some projects here and there, and places like energy, and certainly a few in the chemical space, some short-term stuff in water that indicates, people are trying to get at capacity just like we are and throughput, so that continues to add to the mix. So I \u2013 very, very strong, overall steady, and that\u2019s one thing that makes it pretty easy to navigate. Michael Halloran : No, that makes sense. And on the margin side of things, the FMT margins really stood out this quarter. I know, Bill highlighted some of the reasons, but maybe just some thoughts on sustainability on that side, if there\u2019s anything that wasn\u2019t repeatable in that mix, as we look forward here? Eric Ashleman : Yeah. Now look, I think, we \u2013 as you can see, and I said on the remarks, I mean, we made some nice progress on throughput and velocity that always helps our situation. It\u2019s nice from a leverage perspective and it also implies that things are working more efficiently. The impasse the consolidations that we had last year in FMT specifically has been a big benefit for us as we go. And then, I know, we\u2019ll dive into price cost along the way. But, of course, we\u2019ve done our best there to keep our head above water. You\u2019ve kind of put that into the mix with more throughput and output. That\u2019s a good mix for us overall, and you see it reflected in performance. Michael Halloran : Appreciate it. Thanks for time. Eric Ashleman : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Nathan Jones : Good morning, everyone. Eric Ashleman : Hi, Nathan. Nathan Jones : Just a couple of questions on the guidance to start with, it looks like pretty much your guidance for revenue for the rest of the year, even at the high end relative to the first quarter, the quarterly run rate is up only by about as much as the Nexsight acquisition adds. I think, Bill, you said you built $100 million-plus of backlog during the quarter. Is this really you guys just assuming that supply chain limits your output for the remainder of the year maybe core demand is a little bit better than that. But you\u2019re just assuming that you don\u2019t get a lot of relief from the supply chain constraints and that restrains what you can actually ship? William Grogan : Not exactly, Nathan. As we look at, obviously, the team\u2019s ability to increase their output directions we\u2019re taking internally has improved with some of the external events that have happened recently in the unknown longer-term implications just can\u2019t count on significant ramp from our current volumes that we\u2019re at now. Obviously, if things unwind and resolve there\u2019s upside opportunity in the back half, definitely based upon the strong backlog that you\u2019ve highlighted. Nathan Jones : Okay. I think cautions fair enough that things could only get worse, right? William Grogan : Yeah, exactly. Nathan Jones : Second question I had is on capital deployment here. You guys have certainly stepped up the pace of acquisitions, and how aggressive you\u2019ve been there. The markets clearly worried about recession in 2023. Does this change your calculus in how you are thinking about going up there acquisitions in terms of, how you\u2019re de-risking your deal models, risk premiums, that you\u2019re putting on things. Any change to the calculus that you guys are using over there as you\u2019re approaching acquisitions at the moment? Eric Ashleman : Yeah, I\u2019d say, I mean, not a lot in the short-term, again, it come back to kind of the nature of the assets that we\u2019re looking at here. They\u2019re very representative of kind of classic IDEX businesses, high mission critical solutions, risk adverse end markets, I mean, they\u2019re not the kind of businesses that Bob and we\u2019ve a lot in the short-term. And ultimately, the valuation on the part of the seller and for us on the part of the buyer comes down to the assurance of pretty steady growth and cash streams and high quality earnings over time. And, of course, what we think we could do to a business on the inside, which is mostly under our control anyways. So not to say, we\u2019re discounting any of those things, but certainly \u2013 particularly in the short-term, it doesn\u2019t really change the view of what we think is favorable for the long-term health of the company. Nathan Jones : Have you seen that uncertainty in the market out there at the moment from the seller\u2019s perspective, improved pricing at all on any of these assets that you\u2019re looking at? Eric Ashleman : No, I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve seen that that\u2019s often a lagging phenomenon. And again, this \u2013 we\u2019re in very high quality waters, with generally long histories that anybody would refer to, and just degrees of health in the future, all positive. So it doesn\u2019t really enter the mix of these kinds of assets too much. Nathan Jones : Perfect. Thanks for taking my questions. Eric Ashleman : Thank you, Nathan. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Eric Ashleman : Hi, Deane. Deane Dray : Hi. When we see record orders, record sales, record backlog, and upside in organic, it\u2019s not sure that you did miss any revenues, because of supply chain. But did you have any projects that you couldn\u2019t ship past due anything you could size there? Eric Ashleman : I mean, there was a couple of isolated things, the amount left on the table versus the number we quoted in Q4 was down substantially. Again, the team\u2019s ability to work through some of the operational output, and then just slight improvements in some of the supply chain areas, a lot less than, I think, we quoted around 3% in the fourth quarter, much lower number kind of a couple of basis points type of framework. Deane Dray : That\u2019s really helpful. And on the cascade on that shows the growth investments in discretionary, I\u2019m always interested in knowing some of the specifics inside there, because, obviously, you could cut-back on growth investments anytime and dress up quarterly earnings, but that\u2019s not what you all do. So what\u2019s in the growth investment and the discretionary buckets? And what kind of payback should we expect? William Grogan : Yeah, Deane, we\u2019re committed to invest, making these investments and outside of what happens in the short-term, these are things that we\u2019re committed to that are going to drive growth for us long-term. We talked about engineering resources, different commercial initiatives we have across the portfolio. Eric\u2019s highlighted several times just the build out of our M&A team to improve the conversion that you\u2019ve seen in our M&A pipeline. And we\u2019ve got great projects in all 3 segments, either through new product launches, investigating new markets to leverage different applications for our technologies. And then even in the second quarter here, we\u2019ve got some larger trade shows that we\u2019re back in the largest North American trade show for Fire & Rescue that we\u2019re going to launch a couple new products and bring those to market. So a lot of exciting things across the portfolio that we\u2019re committed to investing, as we progress through the year like we talked about, we gave our initial guidance. And then, Eric, anything else you\u2019d want to add. Eric Ashleman : Yeah, I would just continue to highlight, we talk a lot about the top kind of those that list of top organic bets for the company, the resources, Bill was talking about maps really, really solidly to that list. So it\u2019s not spread evenly. It\u2019s very disproportionately tuned with that addition for sort of more enterprise work around strategy and sectors we\u2019re interested in as we think of putting money to work. Deane Dray : That\u2019s really helpful. And Eric, since you asked \u2013 to be asked about price costs take us through where the pricing is expected to read through the rest of the year, and how you expect to end up on price cost? Eric Ashleman : Yeah, I\u2019ll hit it generally, like, Bill kind of fill in the blanks in terms of models and numbers. But, I mean, like we\u2019ve been, as you\u2019d suspect, very, very aggressive on the pricing front and talking about it for a long time, where we think we\u2019re entitled to it, given the differentiation and the problems that we solve out there. We\u2019ve worked at very systematically across the company, I mean, there\u2019s an approach to how we do that. We take into consideration, the long and deep often personal relationships that we have customers and how to navigate that effectively in an environment like this. So I would say here, as we\u2019ve talked through last year, we got some ways that the cycle came up, and the velocity of it was in many ways unexpected in the beginning of the year. We kind of caught up with it in the back half. And then, I see us in a more favorable position as we enter the year here, and I think you see that reflected in the margins. William Grogan : Yeah, I think, continued progression here in the first quarter. I think as each month goes by the additional pricing actions we\u2019ve taken, we have seen increased inflation, the teams are doing a much better job getting out in front of it. And, I think, towards the back half of the year will be add or an excess of our historical price cost based upon the line of sight to what we have as of now. Deane Dray : That\u2019s real helpful. Thank you. Eric Ashleman : Thanks, Deane. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Allison Poliniak : Hi, good morning. Eric Ashleman : Hi, Allison. Allison Poliniak : I just want to get back to your comments on the project side, Eric. You had mentioned, it seemed like it was more of a win not if kind of scenario with, obviously, elevated concerns of this next downturn, which seemed more consumer facing at the time. Just would love your perspective, as you kind of think forward here in terms of this project is, would it support maybe a more shallow recession, if when one comes for industrial just any thoughts on your view there? Eric Ashleman : Well, I mean, the second half of that is a broader question that involves a lot of other things. But I would say, just from what we can see here, it\u2019s just been a consistent story. I mean, I think a lot of companies have got work that they need to get at. In many ways, it\u2019s concentrated in certain areas that are more favorable than others, they would love to deploy capital and get at it sometimes at larger scale. But you just see, increasingly, I mean, that the bigger the project, the harder it is to put together, you\u2019ve got to have the people to do it, they\u2019ve got to be familiar with the company, and then you got to be able to marshal all the resources and count on it across a horizon that\u2019s going to be longer than it has been before, so all lead times are much longer than they have been. So any projects duration has got to be able to traverse essentially more risk and uncertainty. And so, I think, what we\u2019re seeing and in fact, even some of the things that I look at that we deploy in our own companies, you kind of go to the head of the list and you say, all right, well, where\u2019s the absolute place that we have to put some money to work and you can see the return sitting in front of us, because the demand is pronounced. And if you can do it in a slightly different way maybe it\u2019s a little bit faster, it\u2019s quicker the scale is of a different nature. Those are the kinds of things that we\u2019re in interacting with. And it\u2019s kind of it matches the deployment within our own business, which, of course, is sort of a different scale. So, I think, that bigger transformative project stuff that\u2019s out there, it\u2019s just that\u2019s the situations that it face, I don\u2019t know, when that ends, I guess, that\u2019s the open question for all of us. But, I see a lot of that related to, it\u2019s just got to find a way to settle into a very different planning environment that has been this way now for a while. But, I think, if folks had a magic wand, they would like it to go away, and they\u2019d like to put that capital to work. That\u2019s what continues to kind of give us the competence and the momentum on the longer term nature of the cycle, as you can see how much of it does need to be deployed? Allison Poliniak : That\u2019s great. And then just a question on max and neutral in the quarter, just based on the backlog, and it\u2019s certainly the pricing items, but more on the mix side. How should we think about that mix as we kind of moved through the year based on what you\u2019re seeing in your order book at this point? Eric Ashleman : No material impact on the year-over-year, I think, for us a lot of the margin mix will be just the FMT margin expansion that\u2019ll be more consistent this year relative to other productivity initiatives that we had last year, so more productivity driving the margin expansion versus favorable or unfavorable mix having major impact. Allison Poliniak : Great. Thank you. Eric Ashleman : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Joseph Giordano : Hey, good morning, everyone. Eric Ashleman : Hi, Joe. Joseph Giordano : So I\u2019m just curious, like obviously with what\u2019s going on in Europe, some major themes around how we transfer energy and food shortages globally. I mean, it realizes are more international problems and domestic here, but just curious if you can kind of take us through how you might be able to help attack those problems that are emerging now. Eric Ashleman : Yeah. Well, of course, we go from macro to micro pretty quick, when we start to think of, how that impacts us. But I like the way you framed it, which is actually anytime there\u2019s disruption, there are problems to solve, and that\u2019s usually healthy for us. So, as things swing around in production goes from one zone to another that means largely the infrastructure might be used in ways that\u2019s more aggressive or higher rates than it has before. We do things like custody transfer on the energy side, if we\u2019re shipping it around the world, or building out ports to do that, that\u2019s places that we play. And so, I think, ultimately, I\u2019d put that in the net favorable for us. And, I think, we saw some of that activity in the first quarter in places like energy. Same thing over on food production, I mean, is that becomes a bigger deal and starts to move around in different geographies and things like that, where capital may be or may not be a need to be deployed, we come along with it with the mission critical fluidic solutions that we have in there as well. So a lot of a lot of major trends to track and get a sense of where they\u2019re heading or where they\u2019re coming from. But I would say just the fact that they\u2019re changing, often presents opportunities for us in the ways that that I described here. Joseph Giordano : That\u2019s helpful. And just on the backlog, just given the orders and the backlog where it is. What\u2019s your ability to kind of protect what\u2019s there, I assume that the duration of the backlog is long, and it\u2019s longer than it typically is. So as you get like kind of inflation while it\u2019s still there, you\u2019re able to protect the margins inherent in the backlog? William Grogan : Yeah, in most of it, Joe, we\u2019ve been able to evolve our terms and conditions over the last 18 months to make sure that we can pass on incremental inflation as it comes into there\u2019s certain contracts that we have that we can\u2019t, but I think we\u2019re well positioned overall. Eric Ashleman : Yeah. Joseph Giordano : Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vlad Bystricky with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Vlad Bystricky : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my call. Eric Ashleman : Sure. Vlad Bystricky : So strong results, impressive first quarter, and you put up strong operating leverage and productivity, despite what we know is a challenging period given Omicron in North America for a lot of the companies we hear from. So can you just talk more about how you were able to navigate that environment and what you\u2019ve seen now in terms of ongoing productivity runway in your plants? Eric Ashleman : Yeah. That\u2019s a great question. So there\u2019s a number of factors at play, some of which we turned to our advantage here in the quarter. I mean, from an external perspective, I\u2019d say the supply chain environment is basically the same difficult some subjects better, some worse, but that not really markedly different. The labor availability piece, I mean, we\u2019re low labor content, but it is critical, somebody eventually has to put things together, that actually improved for us in the first quarter, mainly from absenteeism. We enter the year with high rates. And then as we went on February and March, that actually improved. And I\u2019d say labor availability, generally, while it\u2019s a tough market out there for people, I mean, it did get a bit better for us. And we\u2019ve got less kind of open roles, especially in the production side overall. So that was a component that turned more favorable for us. And then a lot of the work that we do, I mentioned in the remarks, it\u2019s tuning 80/20, from beginning to end supply right through the factory, right to the customer base. We\u2019ve kind of always naturally had that orientation and how we produce, the harder part is actually to draw those connections all the way back into the supply chain, and then move them around. And that\u2019s where I\u2019d say, we\u2019ve done the best work here over the last really 6 months, but you saw the benefit in the last 3. So all that simply means is, you\u2019ve got your best supplier making the part, that\u2019s the most critical for our best part of the factory to our best customer set that alignment is in place, we\u2019ve got ways to query that across the company now. And we can really see the benefit of that, and then that gives you a lot of that volume throughput that we referenced. And I don\u2019t want to lose the other 2 pieces we called out. I mean, we did very difficult consolidations in the middle of a very difficult time. Last year, we\u2019re now, those are completely behind us and they\u2019re in parts of the business that have got good order velocity against them. So that\u2019s like an additive component here. Vlad Bystricky : That\u2019s great color and it shows in the results. Maybe just one follow-up from me on the capital allocation side, it\u2019s nice to see you deploy some cash to share buybacks. And, I guess, first we\u2019ve seen in the past year plus, can you just talk about given the stock performance year-to-date, how you and the board are thinking about repurchases going forward, and whether that\u2019s an area we could maybe see you be more aggressive through the years, the shares remain around where they are? William Grogan : Yeah. No, Vlad, I\u2019ll take that one. We\u2019ve historically had a very disciplined approach for our share buyback program. When we think the stocks undervalued, what we consider our intrinsic value of the company, we\u2019re back in buying shares. And, obviously, with the significant decline we\u2019ve seen here, and we think that\u2019s short-term related, a lot of the conversation, Eric\u2019s highlight is we\u2019re really bullish on the next couple years, both from an industrial cycle and our ability to put broader capital work in the M&A space. So we\u2019re taking advantage of where the share price is, and we\u2019re going to continue to buy at the current level, if we\u2019re still at this value here as we progress through the quarter. Vlad Bystricky : Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Eric Ashleman : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Loop Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Scott Graham : Hey, good morning, all. Thanks for taking my question. I understand for sure from your comments, Eric, that the impact of supply chain on the top line was a lot less than this quarter than last. But is that a number that you guys can maybe give us the impact on sales? Eric Ashleman : Well, I mean, it so from how much that we would attribute to gating is supply chain conditions overall? I mean, it\u2019s a slight step down, I think, we\u2019ve said typically before we\u2019ve been somewhere in the point or two, things we wish we would have been able to get out or otherwise. And I\u2019d say, this is a slightly more favorable tune, or landing position for us, largely for a lot of the work that I just talked through there. I mean, I\u2019d say the one external component is that slight uptick in labor availability for us, recognizing again it\u2019s a relatively small part of kind of our spent in P&L. Scott Graham : Understood. Thank you. And as far as like the 20 to 25 projects, I know that they look a little bit different today than they did a pre-COVID. Recall that you talked about the monetization when you guys pivoted into a post-COVID environment. Forgive me for not remembering that number, I thought it was like $100 million in incremental sales, something like that that you guys envision maybe being able to capture. Can you kind of tell us where you guys are on that curve? William Grogan : Scott, maybe I\u2019ll take that one. So, yeah, back in late 2020, we said, a $50 million to $100 million of potential incremental COVID opportunities. In 2021, we said incrementally was probably flat, 50 versus 50, so no big increase last year. And as we progress through this year, it\u2019s been pretty consistent. There\u2019s been no material pickup in COVID opportunities or decrease. So\u2026 Eric Ashleman : But then that would \u2013 Scott that would still leave kind of standard deck to drive out performance for us 200 to 300 basis points. And as Bill said, we went through a period where there was more COVID things in it. Now, those have kind of normalized to some degree, and we\u2019re back looking at fast growing applications that kind of map to the world we see ahead of us. So we tune that fairly regularly and we\u2019re always looking at what should be up there, which should be \u2013 should not, we don\u2019t do that around sort of calendar cycles, we\u2019re continually evaluating that and saying, if we hit a milestone that would suggest something needs to come off, and we\u2019re seeing an opportunity elsewhere. William Grogan : Got it. Well, thank you. And if I could just squeeze one in on dispensing, fourth quarter, the call you were a little bit of a lot got it on the dispensing outlook for this year, and then it looks like it had a pretty good first quarter. Could you kind of update on what you\u2019re seeing there and what to expect? Eric Ashleman : Yeah, Scott, I think that\u2019s a first half versus second half. We continue through the back half of last year to win some larger projects here in North America, that\u2019ll be delivered in the first half, so continued strength here over the second quarter, and then much more difficult comps in the back half of the year. William Grogan : Thanks very much. Eric Ashleman : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Summerville with D. A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question. Will Jellison : Hi, this is Will Jellison on for Matt, this morning. Good morning. Eric Ashleman : Hi. Will Jellison : So I want to ask about the first quarter performance and try to understand better the extent to which the performance was enabled by preparation measures taken throughout 2021 versus things that were more on the fly, if you will, in response to things as they arose through that first quarter? Eric Ashleman : Well, I mean, if I go back to the comments, I had just a few moments ago, where I sort of delineated, the labor impact, which was positive for us, I mean, I would say almost all of that that\u2019s an external situation playing through, coming off the Omicron infection rates and higher absenteeism, and then that moderated as we went through the quarter. And I do think labor availability, more generally, in some of the regions we do business improved from conditions last year. So I put that on the external side, that\u2019s a component, the tuning I talked about relative to 80/20, and supply chain, and how we move that through the supply base or resourcing. I made some comments about that engineering, resourcing in our engineering design work in the opening comments, prepared remarks. And that\u2019s our side of it. That\u2019s things we\u2019ve long been doing to try to keep pace with a very, very difficult supply environment. So I don\u2019t know with the exact balance, I would say, but you got some of both coming together there. And, in both, I think likely to continue for us as we go forward. Will Jellison : Understood. That\u2019s helpful. And then I do want to ask you about China, I know that at this point, it\u2019s a relatively small portion of the footprint. But I know that throughout 2021, you were making investments in facilities there. I\u2019m wondering at this juncture in April, given the kinds of lock downs activity we\u2019ve seen there. What\u2019s your view on the impact, or potential impact there might be and how IDEX might be positioned to respond to it? Eric Ashleman : Well, I think like everybody else were watching the current situation play out, I mean, pretty hard to predict how things are going to go, also hard to imagine that this is a big long-term event, I mean, there\u2019s no doubt be some overhang here. But I would just kind of go back to what we said, when we made when we thought of the investment, we talked to everyone here about it. This is a massive economy. Our approach there is very local, it\u2019s completely local. So we\u2019ve got resources on the ground, we\u2019ve got technologies available, and we\u2019ve got domain expertise to solve local problems from within the economy. And so, that doesn\u2019t insulate it entirely from macro events that happen there, but it does minimize the sort of disruptive things you can get doing lots of cross border, and that\u2019s never really been our model there, it isn\u2019t the model for India as well, we have a similar campus there. So the investments that we talked about the facilities expansion is, is actually nearing completion. And we look forward as everybody does for hopefully a healthy resolution to what\u2019s going on over there where we\u2019ve got a lot of employees in the region and are going to start there with our first concern is with their health and well being. And then, I still feel very confident about the investments we\u2019re making to be appropriate given the potential of that economy. Will Jellison : I appreciate that. Thanks for taking my question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Connor Lynagh : Yeah, thanks. I think we\u2019ve covered a lot on the full year outlook, so just wanted to ask a couple on the near-term thoughts here. I mean, it seems like your overall messages demand looks strong and there aren\u2019t any sort of warning signs you\u2019re seeing, but you want to be conservative given the overall macro environment. I guess, I\u2019m curious, just in the second quarter, it seems like you are pointing to some potential for some margin compression. Is that based on what you\u2019ve actually seen thus far, either in March or April? Or is that just similar sort of conservative vein there? William Grogan : No, I think, we highlighted sequential margins decline, 50 basis points of it just the Nexsight acquisition coming into the fold on the dilutive impact of the deal amortization. It depending on what your competence, there\u2019s kind of another 50 to 100 basis points, primarily through incremental investments on the discretionary and resource side. As we said, hey, we\u2019re going to have about $20 million, $25 million for each category this year. We spent 4 [ph] in both incrementally that\u2019s going to ramp a little bit here in the second quarter compressed margins slightly. Connor Lynagh : Okay. Understood. Understood. And then just in terms of capital deployment for the year, so the CapEx guidance for the full year would indicate that you\u2019re sort of accelerating there. Just want to make sure, we have context for \u2013 what are the incremental things that you\u2019re investing in there? What are sort of some of the big focal areas for you guys over the next year here? William Grogan : Yeah, I think some of the big ones, Eric highlighted, continued investments in facilities in emerging markets are China expansion and India expansion, the CapEx associated with that\u2019ll ramp here over the next few quarters. And then, we talked about a large infrastructure investment in our Banjo business, with new technology to increase automation and overall output is that business has continued to grow and scale here relative to the differentiation that that product brings to market along with a bunch of other investments is for growth and productivity across the portfolio. Eric Ashleman : Yeah, we got some things in life sciences and in our ceiling business related to semicon expansion, too. So we\u2019re invested in that machine tools and equipment to do that, I wouldn\u2019t say within additive emphasis on the automation capabilities that are out there today, that also has a secondary benefit of helping us on the labor front. Connor Lynagh : Makes sense. Thanks very much. Eric Ashleman : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Shlosh with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Shlosh : Hey, good morning, guys. Eric Ashleman : Hi, Andy. Andrew Shlosh : Firstly, do you know what total price was in the quarter? William Grogan : Yeah, it\u2019s close to 3%. Andrew Shlosh : 3%, right. That\u2019s great color. The other thing I was kind of curious about, what do you think the demand outlook is for kind of [bios/medical flow?] [ph] What are you seeing there? Eric Ashleman : I mean, that\u2019s been very, very healthy. I mean, obviously, there\u2019s a piece of that that\u2019s involved with COVID, or at a minimum the vaccine that therapeutic side of that, lots of interesting things going on with cell-based therapies and other things that are out there. So, I mean, it\u2019s an area of focus for us, we\u2019ve got a nice presence there that has done well, and we continue to stay very interested in it. Andrew Shlosh : Great. Thanks for the color. I\u2019ll pass it on. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. Brett Linzey : Good morning, all. Eric Ashleman : Good morning. Brett Linzey : Hey, I wanted to come back to the guidance framework. You brought up the low-end, left some contingency there and certainly understandable, you mentioned the potential risks. I was just hoping, you could put a finer point on are there specific 1 or 2 regions or areas of the portfolio that where you\u2019re most in this is really a demand side versus price cost, any color would be great? Eric Ashleman : I\u2019d say from a high level there, none of this really comes back to specific areas of concern that map against where we are and kind of where we intersect the world out there. They\u2019re more general, and they\u2019re pretty close to the same ones that everybody else is thinking about. So region locked down in China and what happens is that all plays out and broader exposure to Asia-PAC and supply sides back into mature economies you put us. But it\u2019s on the radar keeping an eye on that certainly the issues geopolitically in Europe. We don\u2019t have a lot of direct presence there. But there\u2019s a bunch of derivative impacts for us and others, we\u2019ll see how that plays out. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019re looking at it, units of measure that are different than the ones that are on the macro screen for most people. William Grogan : And again, I think relative to some of the earlier commentary, less on the demand side, more on the supply side. Eric Ashleman : Yeah. Brett Linzey : Got it. Makes sense. And then just back to HST, the continued wins in sequencing in semiconductor. I was hoping you could just unbundle that in what the contribution was to the 20% order print. And then specifically within semiconductor, how are you aligning with some of these big capital commitments here in the U.S. and Europe on the fabs? Eric Ashleman : Well, I mean, so like I \u2013 it\u2019s kind of hard to do that specifically, because it goes in different businesses and goes in different places, I would just say, very, very strong on both of those categories. On the semi side, I mean, we\u2019re \u2013 like we\u2019re involved in different aspects of that we\u2019re involved in some businesses, we kind of come in there on the fab side, when we build out infrastructure, and other places, we\u2019re actually involved in the metrology side, or the inspection of things that are made in that infrastructure. So we\u2019re well positioned throughout and well positioned with the names that most people think of when they think of that industry. Brett Linzey : Okay, great. I appreciate it. Thanks a lot. Eric Ashleman : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question. Rob Wertheimer : Hi. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Eric Ashleman : Hi, Rob. Rob Wertheimer : I just wanted to see if you\u2019d round up discussion a little bit on capital deployment and acquisition, where you\u2019ve obviously been successful and steady in the past year, and to this quarter, 1Q and 2Q. Can you give any just sort of background on how the funnel looks versus a year-ago versus a year and change ago, you\u2019d be operational focus, I think is shifting more and more towards there, any changes to how that broads out the funnel or accelerates progress through it? And I\u2019ll stop there. Eric Ashleman : Sure. Well, I think for a while we\u2019ve been talking about the intentionality of the work, so we resourced it in a different way, put some people on, brought some folks in from the outside, I mentioned, Roopa, in my earlier comments, she brings a lot to the effort as we go. But a lot of this comes from \u2013 bottoms up, I mean, it comes out of the businesses who know their worlds and markets the best. And you can kind of see that if you look at the last few acquisitions in particular, they\u2019re all very close to home to our businesses. And, in fact, we\u2019ve known them for a long, long time. So in some ways, we\u2019re taking advantage of targets that have been out there that we\u2019ve understood with much more focused cultivation, understanding and ability to get the transaction done, and then integrate it successfully in the company. So that\u2019s always going to be a big piece of what we do. Right next to that, then is broadening that work and starting to think about, well, if you go slightly to the left or to the right, or extend out the time horizon a bit further, what does that suggest about the universe that\u2019s out there, which could be known in some cases isn\u2019t known. And so it\u2019s very, very focused work, it\u2019s process driven. You can think of it is almost a grid of intersection between the work that we do and the problems that need to be solved in the world and where they cross over. Again, a lot of it is relatively close to home, because we\u2019re looking to leverage the domain expertise that we have the market insight and presence and positioning of current businesses. But it\u2019s coming together in an interesting way, and we long, et cetera, I\u2019d said, ever since I took the seat, I was trying to level loaded a bit. And that\u2019s now happened, it makes that resource base more stable, and makes the work more predictable, and it\u2019s easier to optimize. So that\u2019s kind of where we are now looking forward to where we\u2019re going to take it and talking to you about it as we go. Rob Wertheimer : That\u2019s fantastic. And so that\u2019s obviously the process focus seems like it\u2019s paying off. I mean, as you look at your metrics on just scale of opportunities, out of opportunity progress through, I assume you anticipate this higher level of acquisition activity is well supported to continue. Eric Ashleman : That\u2019s the plan. I mean, we\u2019ve got the \u2013 to complete the kind of growth maps that we have for the businesses, we\u2019re going to often want to bring in some technologies and position points that we don\u2019t have today. This is a great way to do it. And we\u2019ve got the great cash generating facility and balance sheet to pull it off. And so, but doing it in a way that works for us process driven, people dependent, we like that. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to build there. Rob Wertheimer : Perfect. Thank you. Eric Ashleman : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Walt Liptak with Seaport Research. Please proceed with your question. Walter Liptak : Hey, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Eric Ashleman : Hi, Walt. Walter Liptak : Hi. We didn\u2019t cover a lot of ground, but I thought I\u2019d try and drill into a couple of things. Certainly, you recognize that the Europe and plenty of geopolitical things are in the quarter. Did you notice anything with demand like orders or with any kind of project delays or anything like that? And if you compare it and contrast in supply chain in the U.S. versus Europe, or can you see any differences? Eric Ashleman : I would say nothing yet. Nothing on the front that\u2019s hit the radar here. And we have a big broad cross section of different markets, different pressure points, and I wouldn\u2019t be able to pick anything out specifically yet. Walter Liptak : Okay. All right. Fair enough. And then, I think, Bill\u2019s remarks about the paint dispensing market. I think, he made a comment that globally, it was looking, okay, is what I wrote down. But, and then on the follow-up question, you said that it was still the second half where you thought that was going to slow down. I just wanted to make sure I didn\u2019t miss hear something, was there some sort of a pickup in dispensing internationally for orders that might get better? William Grogan : Yeah, Walt, I think overall, the paint markets strong, obviously, from time to time, there\u2019s large replenishment orders in North America that were coming off of the back of a huge cycle there that\u2019ll be have the tougher comps in the second half of the year. So demand \u2013 core demand is still strong across the globe with just tough comps on some of these projects. Eric Ashleman : And you still have a lot of especially the Asia side of things is, I mean, it\u2019s just now automating we\u2019re still involved in that cycle, which is a little bit more steady state, less project specific. So it\u2019s really how these things come together and timeout. Walter Liptak : Okay, great. Okay, thanks very much. William Grogan : Thanks. Operator : And we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to CEO, Eric Ashleman for closing remarks. Eric Ashleman : Thanks very much. I\u2019d like to thank everybody on the call for your interest and support to IDEX. Just 2 final points for me : one, that just a really, really big thank you to our IDEX teams and business partners that are out there. Bill and I do our best to simplify the story here makes it seem easy enough, it\u2019s not. I mean, we deliver highly engineered solutions to very demanding customers to solve super critical problems. It\u2019s tough to do on the best days. This has been a pronounced difficult environment. And I\u2019m really, really proud of how our teams have come together and made the improvements and progress they have here. So I just really want to thank them. And look, we talked a lot about those challenges that are out there, the things that that folks are wondering about. And I just remind everybody, our company is uniquely positioned to help with many of those problems to solve them. It\u2019s reflective our mission and values, and when we do our job as well. We\u2019re rewarded financially with gross margin expansion tasked to take the business to the next level. So we\u2019re leaning forward, we feel good about where we are and look forward to talking with you, as we go about the progress we\u2019re making. Thanks very much. Operator : And this concludes today\u2019s conference, and you may disconnect your line at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Allison Lausas, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer. Thank you. You may begin. Allison Lausas : Good morning, everyone. This is Allison Lausas, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for IDEX Corporation. Thank you for joining us for our discussion of the IDEX second quarter 2022 financial highlights.  Last night, we issued a press release outlining our company's financial and operating performance for the 3 months ended June 30, 2022. The press release, along with the presentation slides to be used during today's webcast, can be accessed on our company website at idexcorp.com.  Joining me today are Eric Ashleman, our Chief Executive Officer and President; and Bill Grogan, our Chief Financial Officer.  The format for our call today is as follows. We will begin with Eric providing an overview of the state of IDEX's business. Then Bill will discuss IDEX second quarter financial results and update on segment performance in the markets they serve and our outlook for the third quarter and full year 2022. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. If you should need to exit the call for any reason, you may access a complete replay beginning approximately 2 hours after the call concludes by dialing toll-free number, 877-660-6853 and entering conference ID 13724804, or simply log on to our company homepage for the webcast replay.  Before we begin, a brief reminder. This call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to safe harbor language in last night's press release and in IDEX' filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  With that, I'll now turn this call over to our CEO and President, Eric Ashleman. Eric Ashleman : Thank you, Allison, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 6. IDEX delivered outstanding results in the second quarter. We achieved record sales levels, 12% organic growth supported by double-digit contributions from each of our operating segments. Our backlog grew by 43 million, and we now sit at record levels to continue momentum into Q3. Core profitability continues to be strong even as we return to more normal discretionary spend levels, allowing us to fully invest in our best growth investments.  We delivered record adjusted EPS of $2.02, an increase of 15% over the prior year's second quarter. Last quarter, I described how our IDEX teams leveraged 8020 to accelerate throughput within a challenging supply chain environment. That positive momentum continued in the second quarter as our teams improve their ability to execute and deliver for our customers.  Our decentralized operating model, which aligns decision-making at the point of impact close to the customer, drives the speed and agility required for us to outperform. Our lead times were a competitive advantage and enabled share gain in pockets across the company.  Inflationary pressures remain, but the rate of increase decelerated, while we continue to capture price equivalent with our differentiation. Gross price capture increased and we expanded our price/cost spread trending back towards historic levels.  We remain committed to our capital deployment strategy and M&A remains a top priority for us. This quarter, we closed on the acquisition of KZValve, a complement to our agriculture business within FMT. Our pipeline is strong, and we continue to evaluate opportunities in higher-growth markets that support our style of competition. We have a healthy balance sheet and are confident that we can continue to put our capital to work.  We're also deploying capital organically across our portfolio to drive operational efficiencies and increase capacity to support our growth. We continue to make investments in commercial, engineering and M&A resources that enable us to execute on our strategy.  During the quarter, we increased our share repurchases and deployed $88 million to buy back 475,000 shares of IDEX stock. We remain disciplined with our methodology to create long-term value for shareholders when we see a disconnect between our intrinsic assessment of IDEX enterprise value and our public valuation.  Lastly, in the second quarter, our Board approved an 11% increase in our dividend. Rising interest rates, continued inflation and geopolitical dynamics all present some uncertainty for us as we consider and head into the second half of the year, but we're not yet seeing any major signals of near-term slowing within our commercial environments. We have good line of sight to the next 90 days, and we continue to see strength in almost all our end markets.  As we look across the industries we serve and our portfolio of differentiated technologies, we're confident that IDEX is well positioned to outperform during any short-term market volatility. It's been a really strong first half of the year, and our teams have a lot to be proud of, but it's not easy to overdeliver in this environment. I'd like to thank our IDEX employees around the globe for their hard work, diligence and agility as they execute for all our stakeholders.  With that, let me turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results. William Grogan : Thanks, Eric. I'll start with our consolidated financial results on Slide 8. Q2 orders of 839 million were up 12% overall and up 7% organically. We experienced strong orders growth in HST and FMT, but saw contraction in FSD driven by dispensing North America's strong replenishment orders received last year. Second quarter sales of $796 million were up 16% overall and up 12% organically. We experienced record sales with double-digit increases across all 3 of our segments.  Second quarter operating margin was 23.4%, up 30 basis points compared to prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 23.8%, down 60 basis points. Incremental amortization related to Airtech, Nexsight and KZValve acquisitions unfavorably impacted adjusted operating margin by 80 basis points.  Second quarter net income was $138 million, which resulted in EPS of $1.81. Adjusted net income was $154 million, resulting in an adjusted EPS of $2.02, up $0.27 or 15% over prior year. Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $97 million or 63% of adjusted net income. This reflects higher accounts receivables driven by the significant increase in sales versus last year as well as elevated inventory levels. Inventory has increased to buffer supply chain challenges and leveraged material availability as a competitive tool to take share in the market. We have spent a lot of time with our teams reviewing their inventory reduction plans and are targeting to bleed down our inventory positions in the second half of the year.  Moving on to Slide 9, which details the drivers of our adjusted operating income. Second quarter adjusted operating income increased $23 million compared to last year. Our 12% organic growth contributed approximately $22 million flowing through at our prior year gross margin rate. We levered well on the volume increase. Our teams drove operational productivity, and we had strong price capture to offset inflation headwinds. Price cost was accretive to margins and is trending towards our historic levels.  We experienced positive mix of $2 million across the portfolio. We reinvested $4 million, mainly in the form of engineering and commercial resources, to drive long-term growth and additional resources to support our accelerated M&A activity. Lastly, discretionary spending increased by $9 million versus last year and up $7 million versus the first quarter of 2022. Our teams across the globe are back to in-person partnering with our customers, actively marketing our products and investing to support innovation.  As we look ahead to the second half of the year, we do not expect this level of sequential increase to continue. We've now ramped to our pre-pandemic spending rate, but on significantly higher sales. Our organic flow-through was 23%, in line with the flow-through expectations we set at the beginning of the year, but most likely the lowest rate we will experience this year. Flow-through is then negatively impacted by the dilutive impact of acquisitions and FX getting us to a reported flow-through of 21%.  With that, I'd like to provide a deeper look at our segment performance. I'm on Page 10. In our Fluid & Metering Technologies segment, we experienced a strong second quarter for both orders and sales with organic growth of 8% and 13%, respectively. FMT adjusted operating margin expanded by 170 basis points versus last year. The increase included 60 basis points of headwind due to incremental amortization related to the Nexsight and KZValve acquisitions.  Volume leverage, strong operational productivity and favorable price costs were the main drivers of the increased adjusted operating margin. Our industrial markets are exhibiting stable demand with consistent quote activity over the last few quarters. We are seeing small to midsized projects coming through in the oil and gas and petrochemical markets as well as in applications tied to mining, asphalt and lithium-ion battery production. Agriculture continues to perform well. Farmers are experiencing record inflation and look to our technology and precision ag to drive productivity. The KZValve integration is going extremely well, and our automation project at Banjo is on track.  Market conditions remain favorable in our municipal water business. We continue to see a strong commercial funnel and long-term optimism, driven by government funding and ESG initiatives. On the energy side, upstream markets are experiencing healthy demand with oil prices providing strong support. Midstream investments have yet to see a bump in activity due to customer supply chain constraints and caution our long-term price sustainability.  Moving on to Health & Science/Technology. Stellar commercial performance continues with organic orders up 13% and organic sales up 12%. HST adjusted operating margin contracted by 130 basis points versus the second quarter of 2021. Incremental amortization related to the Airtech acquisition unfavorably impacted adjusted operating margin by 130 basis points.  Additionally, adjusted operating margin was driven by strong volume leverage and positive price cost, partially offset by increased employee-related costs, discretionary spending and resource investments. HST continues to benefit from strong secular growth trends within life science, analytical instrumentation, semiconductor and food and pharma markets. The life sciences market is experiencing strong demand for next-gen sequencing instruments and consistent core diagnostic market performance. Analytical instrumentation and material processing results remain strong on continued pharma and biopharma demand. On the semiconductor side, we continue to see growth, but at a slower pace. We've been able to offer shorter lead times than our competitors, enabling share gain across a variety of applications. We continue to see strong growth in our optics businesses tied to broadband satellite technology and strength in our industrial businesses similar to the FMT results.  Finally, turning to our Fire & Safety/Diversified product segment. Orders contracted by 5%, but sales were strong with an organic increase of 11%. FSD adjusted operating margin contracted by 280 basis points versus the second quarter of last year. This was driven by higher volume being more than offset by higher employee-related costs and discretionary spending as well as pressure on price cost due to aged OEM backlogs on the fire side and automotive exposure with more metal content within BAND-IT.  As we noted in prior calls, we have taken action to address this gap and expect the price/cost will improve in the second half of 2022 as those increases pull through our backlog. Our dispensing business performed well, driven by delivery of North American project volume and an overall positive global paint market.  BAND-IT had strong results across the industrial, automotive and oil and gas markets. On the automotive side, we continue to outperform the market and capture share on new platforms. In Energy, we see strong downhole market demand and capture share due to material availability with shorter lead times for our customers.  Within Fire & Safety, we are seeing strong demand with our E3 rescue tools. On the fire side, core North American and European markets remain choppy due to OEM supply chain constraints, but we are starting to see some modest improvement.  With that, I'll like to provide an outlook for the third quarter and our full year 2022 results. I'm on Slide 11, which lays out our updated guidance. For the third quarter of 2022, we are projecting organic revenue growth of 9% to 10% and operating margin of approximately 24%. Q3 forecasted op margin is up slightly versus second quarter due to improved price cost, partially offset by lower seasonal volume leverage. We expect GAAP EPS to range from $1.80 to $1.85 and adjusted EPS to range from $1.98 to $2.03.  Turning to the full year. Given our strong performance in the first half of the year, we are raising our full year guidance. We now expect full year organic revenue growth of approximately 10%. This reflects our confidence in line of sight for the third quarter, but some caution in the fourth quarter due to the short-cycle nature of our business. We expect GAAP EPS to range between $7.19 to $7.29 and adjusted EPS to range from $7.88 to $7.98. Our operating margin for the full year is expected to be approximately 24%. We are expecting free cash flow as a percent of adjusted net income to range from 75% to 80%, down from our previous guidance. With our higher revenue expectations for the back half of the year, elevating our year-end receivables balance and a slower-than-expected inventory bleed, this is our best estimate as we head into the second half of the year.  Our long-term goal remains to be above 100% and consider the current guidance a reflection of the volatile external environment versus a structural shift in our cash generation capabilities.  With that, let me pause and turn it over to the operator for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Robert W. Baird. Michael Halloran : So let's start with the comment, Eric, that you said you're really not seeing anything yet in terms of deterioration. Things are going well, and you can certainly hear that from all the end market commentary you guys gave. And then balance that with the guidance outlook that says you're taking a little bit more of a cautious outlook into the fourth quarter given short-cycle business and you don't know what you don't know. So -- maybe just talk about those 2 competing things and what things you're looking for in your portfolio to say that things are going to keep this pace, maybe decelerate, could be the BAND-IT business, could be something else, but would love to kind of compare and contrast, all that stuff? Eric Ashleman : Yes. Well, thanks. So we're always looking at what we refer to as our canaries in the coal mine businesses. Those are the shortest cycle, more industrial businesses that are very, very close to the actual consumption that's going on out there in the industrial landscape.  And those have held up really, really well. I mean, I think that's the story of this whole post-pandemic recovery is just the industrial system that's been working feverishly to try to catch up. So that, for us, is always something that we're looking at first to see if there's an indicator of weakness there that usually sends up a signal and then you start to see things come after that.  And so far, as I said in the comments, that's holding in. And then I'm sure we'll talk about this more in the call, but then we balance that with some of the exposure we have across a whole host of markets on the project side. That's more of an indicator for us of overall future confidence where how people are tilting towards uncertainty, those things. And there's a couple of places where we've seen that slow down. I mean, it's an interesting story overall, where in many ways, it's -- that kind of business has just struggled to get traction in this whole recovery cycle. But other than a few indicators and pockets there, we're sending point out a bit further into the future, we sort of keep a look at all of those and then look at our own backlog support on top of all of it that gives us at least the assurance in the short term. And of course, we'll always adjust that and recalibrate it, and that's the joy of a short cycle business. You can do that pretty quick. William Grogan : Yes. And just to frame that, I mean our implied guidance, like, is kind of a 1 percentage sequential deceleration in Q4. So it's small, just a little bit of noise that could potentially be out there. But right now, what we have line of sight to and the confidence in our order patterns, we still think the back half is going to be really strong. Michael Halloran : No, that makes sense. And I think you said the backlog built in the quarter by $39 million, something like that. Is that -- are you seeing lead times extend come in? Is that more a reflection of that underlying order strength through the quarter? Maybe just talk a little bit about the backlog piece. Eric Ashleman : I mean, it's really broad-based. We're looking at the other day to see if it was kind of in pockets and chunks, and it's not. I mean, it's kind of layered across a lot of things. Our lead times in aggregate are holding or decelerating. I mean, we made a comment there that we are seeing some pockets where frankly, our advantaged lead times that are reducing are giving us some opportunity to go grab some share in things. So I'd say on balance, we're not doing anything to drive that in the wrong direction. It's going in the right direction. And the backlog build is very, very broad-based. Michael Halloran : Last question for me. You made a comment there that you invested to support accelerated M&A processes. Is that a reflection of a pretty healthy pipeline? I know the environment has gotten a little more challenging on the M&A side. So I would like to understand what you're seeing and what you hope those investments could get you. Eric Ashleman : Yes. I'd say -- I mean, look, I think the environment for high-quality assets is held up pretty well as we've gone through this. But a lot of this is very deliberate work on our part to say that we want to go deeper, frankly, into our insight into those sort of concentric circles that surround our best applications.  So there's a purposeful step-up in work of that type, in both resources and some things we're doing with third-party analytics to make sure that we understand it as well as we can, in an environment that so far is holding up pretty well for high-quality assets. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Maybe we could start with the free cash flow guidance cut there. And look, we're seeing this across the sector. This is getting to be pretty familiar, but the idea of carrying more buffer inventory and then the expectation with all this demand likely resulting in higher receivables towards year-end. So we get the way the math works. But Bill, can you expand on the time frame for bleeding the inventory down? I guess it really does depend on how the supply chain begins to normalize. But just take us through the math on that. William Grogan : Yes. No, I think that's exactly right. As we sit here now and lead times, as Eric just talked about on our side are improving, we're starting to see that across the broader aspects of our supply chain. So our increased purchases to buffer some of the longer lead times to continue to deliver for our customers is shrinking.  Now it's just catching up with our production and getting that through our system. So -- as we look at third quarter, there will be some improvement, but more material decreases in the fourth quarter leading into the first part of next year.  So again, we've spent a lot of time with the teams to understand and calibrate around still having this robust demand, measuring what our vendors and their capabilities are from a lead time perspective and then drawing down our open POs, and then increasing the throughput as we have here in the second quarter to the first and maintaining that as we progress through the back half of the year. Deane Dray : Is there anything on product shortages, semiconductor-related where your inventory is -- you've got nearly finished goods, but they're waiting on a particular product that's adding to your inventory? Is that an issue at all? William Grogan : Yes. That is a component as we've had customers who other suppliers for them haven't then is capable to produce have held up some of their receipts. So we have finished goods at a higher level than we have had historically because of issues our customers are facing with other suppliers. Eric Ashleman : And maybe, Dean, to the extent you were -- I think you were also asking about maybe unfinished things that we have in our own factories or something waiting on a part, much like you see in the auto world.  I mean, I wouldn't say that it's completely devoid of our environment, but you don't see it all that often because we have pretty quick rapid turn one piece flow kind of build so it doesn't do well with something that's half done, there's really nowhere to put it. And our production process is quick enough, you're better off not starting it just because in general, most of our businesses, that's how we produce things. Deane Dray : That's helpful color there. Because you do hear like for the autos, where they've got all these cars lined up that still need semiconductors and... Eric Ashleman : We wouldn't put a pump or something into the build schedule because we'll make 40 of them in a couple of hours, those kind of things. Deane Dray : Good. Last question for me, Eric, you kind of begged the question earlier to Mike's when he's asking about the macro, you said there are some pockets of slowing on projects. So -- and absolutely, that's a reflection of kind of what we say CEO confidence.  Are they going to move ahead? I think you made a reference to midstream, and we've heard plenty of that. It just really hasn't realized in full kind of spending given oil prices. But where and how would you describe some of these pockets of projects slowing or just not getting the release that you thought you were going to get? Eric Ashleman : Yes. I'd say probably more of the second category, not getting the release or not coming on the line, something we've been thinking about or projecting for a while now and some of these just get extended out.  So you mentioned the midstream side. I mean, there's some pockets in our chemical markets exposure, maybe more on the European side than elsewhere. A little bit in the paint dispensing area. We're just kind of coming off the end of a big replenishment cycle there. And then a few things in just specific industrial markets, food expansion, places like that.  I mean, they're pretty isolated. It's not a massive part of our business, but they're good indicators, things to watch. And I would just say it's been interesting over the cycle here is this category never really took off. I think in the beginning, it was very much clouded with uncertainty. The nature of the recovery, then it turned into a kind of a bandwidth issue.  Can anybody put together the materials or the time and energy to work on it? Maybe here in the later innings of it, it's sort of all of those factors. Uncertainty creeping in back a bit, the bandwidth issue is still there and now inflation and the cost of these projects is causing some recalibration for -- in certain markets where people have to kind of go back and run the math again. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Allison Poliniak : Keeping in line with that project comment. I know you talked verticals, but is it any like weighted towards a specific geography? Or does it seem very broad-based by vertical at this point just in terms of what you're seeing? Eric Ashleman : Well, I mean, I'd say broad-based in terms of the way I just described it. I mean, we are seeing a bit more geographic strength in North America than Europe for all the reasons I think we would suspect in terms of things people are watching there on the geopolitical side, the energy side, those things. But both are positive for us. But if I had to call it, I would say, a little bit more positive on the North American side than Europe. Allison Poliniak : Great. And then just kind of going back to the free cash flow and just CapEx in general, tepid start to sort of the approach to that $90 million. You talked about Banjo and then investment in emerging markets. I mean, are those still on track? Or do you kind of risk that some of that gets pushed to next year just because of the uncertainty right now? William Grogan : No, that's what's going to drive the increased spend in the back half. We're expecting both the India and China facilities to open later this year. And then Banjo I think is kind of late third quarter, early fourth quarter.  So there's -- those projects, I think, are on track. Obviously, that's a subset of the $60 million ramp -- $30 million ramp, $60 million spend in the back half that. Relative to supply chain delays and things, we have seen some items smaller as pushed from the first half to the second. So there's a little bit of play in that number. But for the large ones, we're confident that those will hit here in the next couple of months. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rob Worthermeier with Melius Research. Robert Wertheimer : My question is just a little bit more on M&A. Can you talk about just what the feel is like from potential sellers out there, whether -- I don't know whether things get repriced as you kind of edge through different parts of the process and the market is corrected and interest rates are higher? I don't know if there's a standoff as people adjust to different pricing or not? And then any comment you'd make on how big your funnel and kind of pipeline are versus prior periods? Eric Ashleman : Yes. So as I said before, I mean, all this is bracketed a bit by the step up in intentionality and work that we're doing. So in that respect, again, there's a lot of things we're looking at, a lot of analysis that we're doing and a lot of conversations that we're having.  You would say our -- that just activity level is north of where it has been, much of it driven by our work. Now in those conversations, probably much like the conversations you have, there is definitely more discussions around near-term prospects and what's going on with the forecast and how do you see the sales tracking out and to the extent that all links back to valuation, it's just more intense than it has been for all the reasons you'd suspect.  As Bill and I have always said, though, when you're looking at assets of the quality that we look at, you're generally looking at a history that's very sharp, well positioned, driving in strong ways. And then a reasonable projection path, especially if we're the owners that kind of picks that up again.  So -- that doesn't mean that both sides are going to be able to see that and get through it. So that's always a possibility, but our perspective is very long term in nature for the kind of assets that we're looking at. So long story short, more activity on our part, which means I think a strong funnel for us, a lot of activity, engaging with people more near-term discussions around what this all means and where it's going to go, but then kind of just take a deep breath, stare over the horizon and be confident that for quality, I think ideally both sides see it that way and stay engaged. Robert Wertheimer : Perfect. And if I can, I guess, follow up on that on the uncertainty and so forth. You touched on backlog earlier. I don't know if you're willing to give any more color on where your backlog stands versus prior cycles or versus prior record levels, et cetera. It seems there's a bit of a standoff and that everybody is uncertain about the future, but the future doesn't look bad currently. I don't know if the backlog will help us triangulate that a bit? William Grogan : No, definitely. I mean, our backlog is kind of 2x of what it has been historically. And normally, we'd go into a quarter with 50% of the quarter sales in backlog. We've got close to 2/3 now. So we have a lot more visibility to temper any dramatic short-term falloff.  So again, relative to the next couple of months, we're fairly confident in our numbers. So I don't think there's a huge pause that would come because our backlog could support any short-term decrease in orders. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Matt Summerville : Just a couple of quick questions. With respect to price, can you comment on where you were price realization second quarter year-over-year? And how much incrementally on top of that you expect to realize in the back half? And then I have a follow-up. William Grogan : We're a little over 4% here in the second quarter, which ramped from a little over 3% in the first quarter. We don't guide the balance of the year price, but we're really confident in what the teams have gone out with to combat inflation, which seems to have leveled off. So I mentioned we have an expectation that our price cost is going to continue to improve through the back half of the year to support some of our higher-margin profile expectations. Matt Summerville : In certain areas of the commodity markets, certainly in metals, steel, aluminum, copper, things have come off their highs pretty materially, still elevated from historical standards, but certainly off-peak. When does some of that start to actually add some incremental benefit to your P&L? William Grogan : I would say a couple of things. One, relative to -- we only have a couple of businesses that have direct exposure to commodity prices. From a materiality level, we're buying components that are a couple of phases through that value stream.  So obviously, we didn't have the vast inflation impact on the way in that a lot of other companies did. Again, 4% price increase is still price cost positive, and we're building. So -- that will, I think, wean out over time, it will be a material impact, but we will keep all the incremental pricing that we've had. Again, we've holistically gone out with price increases versus surcharge. So we like where we're positioned here going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : Eric, can we come back to what you said really on deal cultivation, right, in the activity being more of a function of your internal efforts? Maybe you could elaborate on that. Have you significantly up resourced the deal teams? Does this heavy level of activity indicate any interest in kind of pursuing new adjacencies? Just maybe a little bit of kind of strategic and tactical color on what's going on there. Eric Ashleman : Yes. I mean, we're not a massive center-led kind of organization. Never have been. So this might sound more dramatic than it probably is from a headcount perspective. I mean, it's a few well-positioned ads from the outside work that we're doing on the third-party side. And then frankly, the biggest component is just a higher level of engagement overall business to business. I mean, this is something we've been driving now for a couple of years.  And we really focus to combine growth outperformance on top of our just sort of institutional great well-deserved execution shops. And so a lot of it is that way. In terms of where we're looking and what it looks like, I mean, we've always favored. I always come back to this analogy of concentric circles around these applications that we kind of currently sit in.  We know these environments really well. We know what's to the right or left of us, and the best work for me is really starting to understand where is this market heading, should we make a move slightly left or right and how would we do that.  The recent acquisitions that we've layered into the company are perfect examples of that. As we said before, we're also thinking about the broader world in general and where problems are presenting themselves and where IDEX like styles of competition could come in play, and maybe that would open up a flank for us and some applications that are new to the company. So that's in the mix as well.  But if you really had to overgeneralize it and think of it, think of it as just radiating circles from the best parts of the company with more intensity, a lot of it from the ground up. That's the way we like to do it. William Grogan : Yes. I think those actions, the depth and quality of the funnel is probably at an all-time high. Like that work that the team has done across a variety of different end market applications, those concentric circles that Eric highlighted, and one of the main reasons why we are so confident in our ability to deploy capital much more consistently as we progress. Jeffrey Sprague : Great. And unrelated, just back to this -- I mean, everybody's got their hair to the ground trying to snip out an issue with the economy. Any gut feel that actually these improving lead times are actually the canary in the coal mine? And anything happening in just kind of the supply dynamics and kind of order the shipment dynamics or anything that maybe are an earlier precursor of some deceleration? Eric Ashleman : That's a good question. I mean, it's hard to say, though, because in many ways, we've been running us, others at such a hot level. It's pretty abnormal. Pulling back from that in any way, even if it's just simply the deceleration of the tremendous acceleration we've been feeling is going to have a material noticeable impact inside just how it feels in the business.  But I don't know that, that's the same thing as a broader call on economic conditions, maybe more than it's just, okay, it's not at peak levels. We can catch a breath. We can actually be a little bit more planful, mindful. And that's for us and that's for others as well. So think of it more in those terms but then let's say, since there's nothing else to do, we can get product quicker. I don't see it as an indicator of that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vlad Bystricky with Citigroup. Vladimir Bystricky : So I just wanted to ask, kind of following up on these macro-related questions. In your businesses that go through distribution, can you give us some color on what you're seeing and hearing in terms of distributor inventories and whether there are any areas where you're more concerned about a potential for destocking in the event of a slowdown? Eric Ashleman : Yes. Well, I always kind of preface this question with a reminder that we have a lot of configured customized products with quick replenishment, which means not a ton of our inventory on shelves. So it's a small number.  I will say we've got some good visibility to at line of sight minimum. You can see it visually when you go visit them. So you can see some slight increases there for our product. I would assume that's applicable to more stockable components as well.  In our world, we think of that as if ultimately that bleeds off over time, in some ways, it's pretty similar the way that it works in our own business. It takes a while because of the wide variety of SKUs that are out there. None of it's really clumped around a standard solution that if you made a deterministic call on it would just flow out in a big pocket or chunk. So we think about it a lot for IDEX, mainly just as more of an indicator of health overall. But from a meaningful impact to the numbers up or down, it extends over a large time horizon. It's not a giant piece of the business, and it usually is kind of lost in the math, to be honest. Vladimir Bystricky : Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just stepping back. So you talked about obviously, the intent to bleed down some inventory here over the back half and into '23. But your availability has been, I think, a competitive advantage for you.  So can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of your own supply chain availability and logistics that gives you the confidence to begin to bring down inventory without giving up any of the competitive advantage that you've gained through the recovery? Eric Ashleman : Yes. Well, I mean, some of it -- the impends are fact-based. So we can see and we track our own -- our suppliers' performance and their lead times and their on-time delivery to us. So you basically start there and say, \"Well, we can see factually some improvement.\" The logistics loops are quite a bit better than where they have been on the first part of the year. And frankly, our teams are really good now, at navigating them when they kind of run astray. I think the biggest thing for us and anybody that wants to go tackle this now is, in some ways, you got to take advantage of the ability to take a breath. I would say as we've improved throughput, momentum, and we're executing stronger here, that does buy us a little bit of time, space and energy to go back and recalibrate the systems, which is what you actually have to do to go attack inventory. You've got to go change demand signals. That's part by part. It's -- you do it on lines of paper laid out across the desk. And so -- and Bill talked about our engagement with our teams, that's the kind of work we're making sure is happening. People are kind of racking and stacking it 80s to 20s and making the calls based on fact-based patterns that they can see, and taking advantage of the time and energy, they have to go do it. William Grogan : And then some of the areas we have been able to take shares, it's because we have an 80 position with that vendor. And we're getting a higher allocation than some of our smaller competitors. So if they don't have the material availability, we're able to go in and take their volume. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Nathan Jones : Let's start with a question on Health & Science and the organic order growth that you're seeing there. Everybody is focused on the economy going up and down at the moment but that's a business that's less cyclical for you and still showing extremely strong orders.  Maybe you can just talk in a bit more detail about what's driving those? Are these product cycles that have a specific duration? What the outlook is for continued growth there? Just any more color you can give us on the strength around that business. Eric Ashleman : Yes. I mean it's exactly the way you described it. I mean it's very much tied to strong trends that we're going to, I think, see run out for quite some time here. So we -- like everything else in IDEX, we break it down into all sorts of little components and drivers and specific application sets. Some of the ones that are going well there, the AI space is healthy.  That's a decent part of the business -- sorry, analytical instrumentation. And then the genomics space has been very, very active. A lot of that is involving initially COVID and COVID surveillance. I think now as the pandemic has kind of moved on and entering in its third year. We're seeing now some more targeted work around taking some of that technology and applying it for things like targeted medicine and all the things that were always out there for that field of study. So those have been healthy as well.  We continue to have some isolated pockets where we do support for vaccines and things of that nature that stayed strong to the duration as they're continuing to work on different targeted vaccines and things like that for both COVID as well as other things. So it's definitely picking up most of the macro dynamics and trends that we have long known are out there, and it's why we spend a lot of time investing in it and talking about it. Nathan Jones : Maybe one on gross margins. I mean you obviously have very strong gross margins for an industrial company to begin with. They've been pretty consistent over the last few years in this 45%, plus or minus kind of range.  Is there a negative impact that you've seen to gross margins with all of the disruptions around supply chain in COVID that maybe are less related to price cost but modest in efficiencies within your manufacturing that maybe go away that could lead to higher gross margins or anywhere else that you see opportunities to expand gross margins? William Grogan : Yes. No, I think the biggest pressure has been price/cost. With 45% gross margins, you have to have a price cost spread well in excess of that to expand. So that has put constant pressure. And then we continue to invest in engineering resources, which to remind everyone, that is included in our gross margin number.  So we've been able to maintain through robust productivity across the portfolio to offset some of those headwinds. So I do think price cost getting back to historical levels and then our continued volume leverage that we get on the high contribution margins we have in our business. Once we stabilize a little bit from an operations perspective, we'll be able to pull through some increases. With, again, just the very difficult operating environment we've been in, the ability to have discrete productivity projects across the portfolio that we've historically been able to execute on has been muted a little bit too here is another point. So I think as things normalize, we'll get another kicker off of that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Loop Capital. Scott Graham : Congratulations on what was a really good quarter from you guys. I have one quick one for Bill. Kind of can you give us an idea of where sort of your sales are running OpEx versus CapEx? William Grogan : We don't really disclose that externally to be honest. We don't look at it internally. It goes a little bit to the project comment that Eric talked about a little bit earlier. It's not a huge part of our business. So I would say, holistically, most of our projects are OpEx, replacing like-for-like, current IDEX volume and then some incremental market share gains that we have.  The CapEx, we have some specific things that we would be able to realize with plant expansions, new plant creation. But overall, relative to our portfolio, it's not an overly material number. So the short answer would be, holistically, it's more OpEx-related on our sales. Scott Graham : Got it. So now I want to maybe understand dispensing a little bit. There's a comment in the deck, talks about non-repeat orders, quarter back, maybe 2 quarters back, you talked about how dispensing should weaken fairly materially in the second half of this year. I'm just trying to triangulate what that means now for the second half of the year. How does dispensing look? Is it -- does it look better now or not? William Grogan : No, I think it's in line with our expectations that we had at the beginning of the year. I mean orders pressure in the second quarter will have more pressure in the third, but they'll continue to have sales growth in the third quarter with sales finally fallen off a little bit kind of post those replenishment projects in the fourth quarter. So still a great business. Very global. Still having wins in emerging markets. They're launching new technologies on the software side. So although they're going to lose the replenishment, their core business continues to grow. So it's been cyclical over its life span, but a little bit of pressure here in the short term as those projects roll off. But holistically, lots of additional opportunity through software and emerging markets growth. Scott Graham : Got it. And if I could just squeeze this last one on the fire business, where the OEMs, your customers are still saying that they're pretty supply chain restrained. Has anything changed in the last couple of quarters there as it's a pretty good business for you guys, particularly now with your having a nice little beachhead in Europe? Could you give us an idea of where that business goes in the next couple of quarters? Eric Ashleman : Yes, I'd say the headlines there, the supply chain constraints and some of the larger folks that are in that space are still there, still challenging, still fighting that. I will say that there's kind of smaller to medium specialty players have done a decent job jumping in. So that's helped us a bit, just not the biggest part of the market. We remain really, really focused in that business on technology. So there's only so much we can do to help out on the supply chain side. Eventually, that will come to a better place. As it does, we want to be ready with all of the automation that we've been talking about, not only the pieces that we have in the water path of the mobile platform, but we've got a nozzle now that's got connectivity in it and diagnostics. We're doing the same thing on the rescue tools piece. So we've got some really, really good things there just presented in a giant global show here in the second quarter. So that for us is kind of the longer-term headline on an industry that we think will ultimately start to dial in and improve. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Brett Linzey : Just wanted to come back to the orders. So the underlying run rates in the quarter very strong, even more encouraging on a 2-year stack basis. What is your expectation for year-over-year order growth in the second half as customers are no longer advanced ordering or some of this backlog in mind? I mean do you think you can grow orders and anything that July would inform you here? William Grogan : Obviously, back half, we've got much tougher comps. In the third quarter, at least relative to we have visibility. We think we'll still be positive from an organic perspective, highlighted a little bit of the dispensing pressure that will continue. But overall, IDEX still positive. And from a July perspective, no material changes versus the trends that we've experienced here across the portfolio. Brett Linzey : Okay. Great. And then I just was hoping you could spend a moment on the KZValve acquisition, how that performed on a stand-alone basis heading into the close relative to expectations? And then what are you calibrating for accretion within the guidance framework for this year? Eric Ashleman : Sure. I'll cover kind of the general state of the business, let Bill answer the financial question. So I mean that has been a really, really strong acquisition, strong integration process. It is a very, very close complement to our Banjo franchise in the ag space within FMT.  It's conveniently not very far away. And so the teams have really attacked it. It's performed strong as all our agricultural businesses have both in North America and Europe. And so this has been, in some ways, one of the easier integrations because the commercial linkage is so strong in the business, and everybody is speaking the same -- on the same page with technology and the broader market supports it. So very, very strong out of the gate. Excited on the long-term prospects here, and I'll let Bill talk about the specifics. William Grogan : Yes. EPS in the back half, $0.02 to $0.03. Eric Ashleman : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Anastasio with Cowen. Unidentified Analyst : Congrats on the strong quarter. You mentioned the strength you're seeing more broadly, but obviously, the macro is deteriorating. What types of initiatives are you doing internally to prepare for those macro data points, ultimately, if they start impacting the business? Eric Ashleman : Yes. No, thanks for that. So I mean we've seen a lot of these cycles before. We have kind of a standard way that we look at it. I think -- for us, the first lever would be looking at discretionary spend. We've called that out a few times because we came off a base with almost none of it. Now we are out engaging with customers going to trade shows. So it's elevated a bit.  But we know, frankly, if we learned anything over the last couple of years, you can make it through with a much lower level of discretionary spending. That would be the first lever. As Bill mentioned, I think there is an opportunity here for a pretty hard look at productivity across a factory setting. If things were to cool off a bit, and we actually got some bandwidth back on the team's perspective, rethought how flow is working, how different product lines are in different positions than where they may have been a couple of years ago.  So we go there next. The one area that might be a little bit different. We have been talking about it a lot is on the headcount side, on the people side. I mean even today, we still have -- we're still looking for people. The war on talent is real. Some of the communities we live and work in, it's been harder to find labor. I mean that's improved here more recently, but it's still -- there's still pressure in that area.  So that's probably the area, given all the focus we have on growing the company long term and that dynamic, we would be the most thoughtful about where we would make choices, investments and things along the way. Otherwise, I'd say it's a pretty familiar process for us. The short-cycle nature helps us get at it fast. And -- so it's never far away the playbook to run that.  Anything, Bill, you'd add there? William Grogan : No, I think you said it well. It is -- at least our expectation for decrementals will be a little bit higher than they have been historically because of us relative to current profit levels and the war on talent that Eric highlighted. So maybe we would historically have been in the low 30s. We're probably closer to 40% here if there's a slight pickup here as we progress over the next couple of quarters. Unidentified Analyst : That's really helpful. Just one more, if I may. I know we had mentioned orders before, but declining sequentially over the past quarter. What are you seeing from a cadence perspective going forward? William Grogan : Yes, I think there's always our first quarter, we generally get our annual blankets from a lot of our customers. So it's generally inflated relative to sequential profile of the balance of the year. So -- that's the real driver from the Q1 to Q2. For us now, it's kind of leveling off with keeping an eye on just our daily order rates, which have sustained here in the month of July. Operator : There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks. Eric Ashleman : Okay. Well, thanks, everybody, for joining today. We're really, really proud of our first half performance here. And as I close, just -- I guess the one thing I'd want you to take away is it's really a story of \"and\" not \"or\" here at IDEX. I mean we've long, I think, earned our reputation for tactical execution, good times, difficult times. We're seeing that in the performance that we're addressing here today. And we're working deliberately to drive growth outperformance as an additive component of value creation on top of it.  We basically do that by picking the top bets that align really, really well to the macro trends that are going to be great over the long haul. We rally resources around those. And then here, as I spoke a few times, we very deliberately complemented those efforts with organic and inorganic investments, and we'll continue to do that as we go forward.  So I think you're seeing it play out. We're seeing it play out in the acquisitions we made that celebrate precision ag or alternative energy in the pneumatic space or water solutions and what that can be. So you're seeing that come together. And I just want to highlight the additive component of those 2 things, and we'll continue to talk about that as we move forward. Thanks very much for your interest in joining today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

[Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Allison Lausas, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer. Thank you. You may begin. Allison Lausas : Good morning, everyone. This is Allison Lausas, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for IDEX Corporation. Thank you for joining us for our discussion of the IDEX third quarter 2022 financial highlights. Last night, we issued a press release outlining our company's financial and operating performance for the three months ending September 30, 2022. The press release, along with the presentation slides to be used during today's webcast, can be accessed on our company website at idexcorp.com. Joining me today are Eric Ashleman, our Chief Executive Officer and President; and Bill Grogan, our Chief Financial Officer. Today we\u2019ll begin with Eric providing an overview of the state of IDEX's business, then Bill will discuss IDEX third quarter financial results provide an update on segment performance in the markets we serve and discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2022. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. If you should need to exit the call for any reason, you may access a complete replay beginning approximately two hours after the call concludes by dialing the toll-free number (877) 660-6853 and entering conference ID 13724804 or simply log on to our company home page for the webcast replay. Before we begin, a brief reminder. This call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to safe harbor language in last night's press release and in IDEX's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I'll now turn this call over to our CEO and President, Eric Ashleman. Eric Ashleman : Thank you, Allison, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 6. Our global teams achieved excellent results in the third quarter. We delivered record sales, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. Organic sales grew 15% with double digit record growth across all three of our segments. Orders moderated a bit in the quarter, but backlog positions remain robust overall. It's been a strong record setting year so far for IDEX, not easy to achieve in this environment. I'd like to thank all our IDEX employees around the globe for their outstanding efforts. On the capital deployment side, last month we announced our intent to acquire the Muon Group for \u20ac700 million, marking our largest acquisition to date. Muon expands upon a growing core of market-leading precision components technologies, an area of the portfolio we continue to invest in both organically and inorganically. Muon\u2019s technical capabilities like many others within IDEX are well positioned, differentiated, and tunable towards high growth niche applications within broader mega-trends. Muon technology solve critical problems within the most demanding application sets of semi manufacturing, patient care within med tech, food production, and other high quality markets. This acquisition demonstrates the success of our expanded M&A strategy. We combine bottoms-up business intelligence with analysis and insights from a small, strategic community across IDEX to build conviction within a grid of high quality niche applications. Increasingly, as we build and optimize the portfolio, we find that we can drive growth within a target vertical from multiple points organically from within IDEX businesses and externally via M&A. We think this approach is unique and advantaged. It leverages 80-20 in segmentation, our operating model and the quality and strength of our diverse collection of businesses. We also completed the sale of our Knight LLC business in the third quarter. Knight supports cleaning and sanitization within hospitality and janitorial markets. As we've discussed in the past, we continually seek to optimize our portfolio. When we identify businesses or product lines that would grow and thrive for other owners we've divested those assets. I want to express my appreciation to the Knight team for all they have contributed in their 25 years with IDEX. Next, I want to share some exciting organizational news. I'm happy to announce that Melissa Aquino recently joined IDEX, as Senior Vice President, Group executive for FMT and FSD. Melissa has a broad understanding of what it takes to grow and succeed as a team in manufacturing, having served in a wide variety of commercial, operational and leadership roles. She has scale and depth of experience across multiple industries, including consumer, industrial, diagnostic and life sciences. Although we are aligning these segments under a single leader internally, they will continue to be separate reportable segments. I'd also like to take a moment to celebrate the tenure and accomplishments of our HST Group Executive Marc Uleman. We've seen outstanding results under his more than 10 years of leadership at IDEX, driving organic growth, operational excellence, and capital deployment in our fastest growing segment. Finally, we recognize there is considerable churn in the global economy right now, whether tied to geopolitical uncertainty, inflation interest rates, or the fear of a recession. There are several scenarios that could play out ranging from continued industrial growth to a shallow, short term pullback to a deeper recession. We have a plan of attack for each, and I'm confident we'll outperform as we have in the past. Our teams are smart and agile. They will quickly adjust and put their best resources on the best opportunities. That's at the core of our operating approach. We've made great progress in building a strong and sustainable growth engine. It sits on top of a solid foundation of execution within any environment. That's the \u2018and\u2019 not \u2018or\u2019 that we talk about all the time at IDEX. We are leaning in as a team towards the challenges and opportunities ahead. With that, let me turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results. Bill Grogan : Thanks, Eric. I'll start with our consolidated financial results on Slide 8. Q3 orders of $781 million were up 1% overall and down 1% organically. We experienced orders growth in FMT, but some contraction in HST and FSD, primarily driven by timing of some larger orders. Core demand rates remain positive across the segments. Third quarter sales of $824 million were up 16% overall and up 15% organically. We experienced record sales with double digit organic increases across all three of our segments and strong performance across all geographies. Third quarter gross margin expanded by 250 basis points and adjusted gross margin expanded by 10 basis points compared to the prior year at 45.1%, driven by strong volume leverage and favorable price cost partially offset by higher employee-related costs. Third quarter operating margin was 24.5%, up 190 basis points compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 24.9%, up 60 basis points. Incremental amortization related to the Nexsight in KZValve acquisitions, unfavorably impacted adjusted operating margin by 30 basis points. I will discuss additional drivers of adjusted operating income on the next slide. Our Q3 effective tax rate was 21.8%. It decreased compared to the prior ETR of 23.4%, primarily driven due to the tax benefits associated with the sale of the Knight business. Third quarter net income was $179 million, which resulted in an EPS of $2.36. Adjusted net income was $162 million resulting in an EPS, and adjusted EPS of $2.14, up $0.35 or 20% over prior year. Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $182 million, 112% of adjusted net income. This was a record free cash flow for us, mainly driven by higher earnings we are seeing inventory levels stabilize and expect further reductions as we exit the year. Moving on to Slide 9, which details the drivers of our adjusted operating income. Third quarter adjusted operating income increased $28 million compared to last year. Our 15% organic growth contributed approximately $26 million flowing through at our prior year adjusted gross margin rate. We levered well on the volume increase and we had strong price capture to offset inflation headwinds. Price cost was accretive to margins and has returned to historic levels driven by our FMT and HST segments with FSD making improvements sequentially versus the second quarter. We experienced slight positive mix of $2 million in various parts of the portfolio. We reinvested $6 million taking the form of engineering and commercial resources in the businesses and M&A and DE&I resources at corporate tracking to the $0.20 to $0.25 a full year spend we highlighted at the beginning of the year. Lastly, discretionary spending increased by $6 million versus last year, which is slightly below the second quarter of 2022. As we said last quarter we have reached a more normalized post COVID spend rate and significantly higher sales volume. This delivered a strong organic flow through of 31% in the quarter. Flow through is then negatively impacted by the dilutive impact of acquisitions, divestitures and FX, getting us to our reported flow through of 30%. With that, I'll provide a deeper look at our segment performance. I'm on Page 10. In our Fluid & Metering Technologies segment, we experience excellent order in sales performance with organic growth of 2% and 17% respectively. FMT adjusted operating margin expanded by 250 basis points versus last year. The increase included 80 basis points of headwind due to the incremental amortization related to the next site in KZValve acquisitions. We experienced continued strong volume leverage in operational productivity as well as favorable price cost. Our industrial markets continued exhibit steady demand with tailwinds from energy, mining and infrastructure tempered a bit by some European softness. Our look for our municipal water businesses continues to be positive. We see healthy quoting activities in sync with underlying market trends of growing urbanization, further CCTV inspection adoption and infrastructure investments in the U.S. Agriculture remains strong. We are seeing positive signals from both our OEMs and distributors. Commodity prices remain high and increased fuel and fertilizer costs are incenting farmers to invest in precision technologies. Our investment in Banjo's process automation have improved our delivery putting us in a good position to capture share, and we continue to leverage KZValve's expertise and technology to enhance our product offerings. Our energy business is performing well with strong oil and LPG price support. We continue to see favorable results upstream with midstream investments lagging a bit due to supply chain constraints at our customers in larger project spend delays. Moving on to the Health & Technology segment. Orders contracted by 4%, but sales were strong at 13%. Our backlog position remains robust. The contraction and orders were driven by several large orders that the delayed out of the quarter. European capital good softness and tough comparables from the prior year where we grew orders organically by 44%. HST adjusted operating margin contracted by 70 basis points versus last year. The segment experienced strong volume leverage and positive price cost, which was more than offset by increased engineering and resource investments, higher discretionary spending and some inefficiencies incurred as we continue to onboard labor to meet demand and navigate supply chain challenges. We continue to experience strong demand for analytical instrumentation in chromatography and mass spectrometry as well as next gen sequencing technology for oncology testing and research. Our targeted growth initiatives tied to global broadband and energy efficient fuel cells are performing very well. Two great examples of how we are leveraging our tech in fast growing niche markets. The semiconductor market remains steady. We see customer related supply chain issues driving some slowing, but we are offsetting this headwind through share gains. We provide consumables and technology to drive fab efficiency buffering us for some of the CapEx slowdown on the new equipment side. Our material processing business remains strong on continued pharma and biopharma demand. We are seeing some order slowdown due to investment delays by our customers, but our funnel remains strong and of high quality. Our HST industrial market performance is very much like the experience in FMT. Finally, turning to our Fire, Safety & Diversified product segment. Orders were flat year-over-year as a difficult quarter-over-quarter comparables in our dispensing business was offset by strong growth by the balance of the portfolio. Sales were quite strong with an organic increase of 14%. FSD adjusted operating margin expanded by 70 basis points versus the third quarter of 2021 driven by strong volume leverage, partly offset by pressure on price cost and higher employee related costs. Although price cost is still diluted to margins, it did improve sequentially. Our dispensing business performed well with the delivery of North American project volume and continued strength in the global architectural paint market, but orders were down 30% year-over-year due to large North American replenishment orders that we received last year. Within our fire business, OEMs continue to struggle with supply chain constraints, but we did see positive organic growth from price realization, improved execution and favorable performance in loose equipment. On the rescue side we continue to win with our latest generation E3 tool, bringing enhanced tool features to the market. Finally, BAND-IT experienced strong results across industrial, automotive and energy markets. We continue to win share by having shorter lead times and material availability. On the auto side we are outperforming the market by capturing share on new platforms and winning content on priority, high volume vehicles. With that, I'd like to provide an update on our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2022. I'm on Slide 11, which lays out our updated guidance. For the fourth quarter of 2022 we are projecting organic revenue growth of approximately 9% and operating margin of approximately 23.5%. We expect that the volume will decrease sequentially from the third to fourth quarter due to normal seasonality and scheduled maintenance shutdowns. Q4 forecasted op margin is down versus Q3 due to the loss leverage on lower revenues. We expect GAAP EPS to range from $1.75 to $1.80 and adjusted EPS to range from $1.92 to $1.97. Turning to the full year. Given our strong performance in the prior three quarters we are raising our full year guidance. We now expect full year organic revenue growth of approximately 12%. We expect GAAP EPS to range between $7.75 to $7.80 and expect EPS to range from $8.04 to $8.09. Our operating margin for the full year is expected to be approximately 24% and we expect free cash flow as a percent of adjusted net income to range from 75% to 80%. With that, I would like to turn it back to Eric for closing remarks. Eric Ashleman : Thanks Bill. As we wrap-up I'd like to share with my thoughts are with our Pulsafeeder team and Punta Gorda, Florida. Who continue to cope with the aftermath of Hurricane Ian? All our employees are safe and our values shine through as our other IDEX businesses banded together to provide release supplies to our colleagues there and our IDEX Foundation Board of Directors approved a large donation to the American Red Cross. Our facility did sustain some damage, but we have returned to operations. I would also like to extend my public congratulations to Katrina Helmkamp who has replaced Bill Cook as the non-executive chair of our Board of Directors. Bill Grogan and I have both worked closely with Katrina since she joined our Board in 2015, and we look forward to continuing to lever her strong operating leadership skills and experience across multiple markets and technologies to drive IDEX forward. I'd also like to thank Bill Cook, who has been an invaluable contributor to our company, our board, and my personal development throughout his 14-year tenure. With that I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Mike Halloran of Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Mike Halloran : Hey, good morning everyone. Eric Ashleman : Good morning, Mike. Mike Halloran : So couple of questions here more on the demand order side of things. First, on the order side, flash orders against really tough multi-year stack comps here. It seems like a good outcome sequentially lower. When I think about those in order numbers, is there anything in there from a weakening perspective we should think about? And then how much of that sequential change is seasonality or just a normal air pocket that develops as lead times start normalizing to kind of historically normal levels? Eric Ashleman : Yes. I mean, well you hit a lot of the elements there. I mean, there's a piece of this that we always suspected was going to be there as we start to come off of incredibly high backlog positions, especially for a short cycle, quick lead time business like ourselves. So there's a piece of it that no doubt will be that, and we'll keep an eye on the rate of travel of it as it runs out. There is some summer \u2013 kind of summer month seasonality that that's in there as well. I would say from a categorical softness standpoint, probably the one area we'd point to it covers a lot of IDEX businesses would be just some general softening on the European front, which probably isn't too surprising. And then I know, I'm sure we'll talk later here about projects \u2013 large projects and things of that nature. That's an interesting story. I mean they were, at the beginning of this whole recovery, I mean, there was a lot of caution on people's parts, sort of held them back, I think in the middle part or a lot of the duration, honestly there was just not enough time and energy to get at it or resources. And now you're kind of seeing that tilt back probably more of a cautionary tone again. We've got a few things that have moved out and placed themselves decisions into Q1 of next year, things of that nature as well. So a few things that we can point to. Some things that are sort of normal based on where we are from a backlog position and time of year, but underneath and around all of that really, really strong support across the board. Mike Halloran : Thanks for that. Super helpful and in the prepared remarks you talked about the ability for IDEX to manage with whatever kind of environments during your way in 2023 and certainly your track record supports that pretty aggressively. What is the base case as you guys are thinking about it today as we move into next year? Obviously we've talked a lot about the need and the opportunity for a strong industrial cycle. It doesn't mean you can't get some weaknesses we move into next year. So as you look through your pretty varied end markets going into next year, how are you thinking about that setup and what's the opportunity set for growth? Eric Ashleman : Yes. Well look, I think as I said in the prepared remarks, you could see a few paths that would run out here. I mean, one that's more positive, something that's short-term and kind of a short term pullback and then obviously maybe something with a catalyst that's more negative that none of us can imagine. I just always come back, when we talk about that in the company, I mean, we literally scenario play every one of those. We understand kind of what's variable, what's not variable across all our businesses. We always go back to the top growth that's in the company, almost all of which we can kind of see traveling across the duration here. We factor that in as well. We've certainly learned a lot like every company of about how low you can take discretionary spend, in many ways lower than we would've thought possible before. We know where that floor is and kind of how we would stack that against any of those scenarios. We've talked for a while on the headcount side, we'd be careful. Talent is hard to get, I mean, we're not really at a flush position there anyways. We're actually still pretty lean and we'd be very careful there. And then honestly we would \u2013 we would rotate towards the strong and we'd go pretty lean on areas that are weaker. And so, I want to be too predictive here because I think it's still pretty variable in our minds but our approach to each one of those paths is not, we actually know exactly what that is. Mike Halloran : Thanks for that. Really appreciate it. Eric Ashleman : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Nathan Jones : Good morning everyone. Eric Ashleman : Hey Nathan. Nathan Jones : I wanted to just with some price/cost discussion. You guys have said that price/cost has been dilutive to margins in 2022, is that something you target recapturing in 2023 as we've started to see costs moderate. Do you believe you can recapture that margin that was lost in 2022 to price/cost? Eric Ashleman : Yes. No, definitely. As you said in the prepared remarks we're back to our historical levels here in the third quarter as we continue to ramp, our price capture, inflation hasn't gone down but it's moderated a bit. So as we look forward to the stickiness of the price that we implemented here as we progressed through 2022, that's sticking in in 2023 optimistic about our ability to keep above our historical levels. Nathan Jones : Okay. And maybe you could just talk a little bit about some of the order cadence in your shortest cycle businesses. I know you guys have a few businesses that tend to be canaries in the coal mine. I think you said BAND-IT still remains pretty strong, but any commentary you can give us on those businesses that you consider to be leading indicators of the order cadence there? Eric Ashleman : Yes. They're still really strong. I mean they have held steady many \u2013 in many places and there's four or five of them. We've done a really nice job on putting some strategic inventory together. Our natural ability to replenish fast has allowed us to go capture some share and some orders and then turned them and converted them to sales pretty quick on top of it. So no real pressure signs coming from that very short cycle stuff that, that we always talk about. We look at that constantly that's holding up, there's still an awful lot of demand for it. A lot of capacity that's got to lay in and it's always been pretty indicative of kind of the level that the industrial machine is working at because a lot of it is one-for-one replacement. And I think, I mean all of our plants are working pretty fast and I suspect that's the case out in a lot of the places we supply to. So that's holding up well. Nathan Jones : And one last one just on your own inventory levels. Obviously everybody's been carrying a bit of extra inventory through these disrupted times plans on where you think that goes to in 2023 and what kind of catch generation we should be looking at for next year? Eric Ashleman : Yes. Look the third quarter was the, first time in the last several that we actually didn't build incremental inventory and we've start. We've stabilized our current levels and looked to bleed here in the fourth quarter progressing into the first half of next year. Obviously we've set our long-term goal is to be at over 100% cash flow conversion and I think we'll progress to that level over the next couple quarters. First half is always a little bit light from a cash flow perspective on timing and we're more back half loaded. But we look to continue to progress inventory balances down here over the next six months. Nathan Jones : Thank you very much for taking my questions. Eric Ashleman : Thanks Nathan. Operator : Our next question comes on the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Eric Ashleman : Hi Deane. Deane Dray : Hey, I'd like to follow up on Nathan's last question there for Bill. Is there any way to quantify the inventory that you're carrying that would be considered more buffer inventory? That is lead times begin to normalize, you can start to sell that down? And then Eric just talked about being aggressive with the opportunity on some of the fast short cycle businesses that the inventory ready to go. So, and that's kind of, it would be offsetting to that. But can you quantify for us what that opportunity would be to a normalize working capital? Bill Grogan : I think internally we're targeting to get somewhere between a half a turn and a turn as we progress to our more historic levels. The buffer inventory is probably at the lower end of that that we'll keep some of that is the businesses look on the strategic side, where we've been able to take share with some of that inventory level. We'll keep that and the focus is, is just as we've built up inventory to buffer and or have had to increase inventory levels based upon quantities we had to commit to you or customers that have paused some of their shipments as they've worked out supply chain issues on their side. We've built up a little bit of finished goods. Those parts will be the first part to bleed and the things that we think are strategic to enable some of the share capture will hold onto that. Deane Dray : All right, good. That's helpful. And then could we just go through at whatever level you'd like to share the whole cancellation of the customer COVID test application? I think you framed for how it was \u2013 how that came about and the impairment that you took. Is that the end of it in terms has it been completely written off, and you did include it in your operating results, which we appreciate? Eric Ashleman : Yes. That's the end of it. I mean, there's small \u2013 some small shipments here in the fourth quarter, but fundamentally it was an initiative that we started and highlighted back in 2020. We partnered with that customer and had a great relationship relative to the partnership on developing the technology and them committing a significant amount of capital to support our production capabilities. And obviously as they've moved in a different direction and got out of the testing, cause the impairment and then the recognition of all that deferred revenue here within the quarter. So most of the noises is they have been taken here in the third quarter. We've kind of moved past with significant knowledge gained in terms of production capabilities and technology that we'll continue to leverage as we move forward. Deane Dray : That's real helpful, thank you. Eric Ashleman : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed your question. Allison Poliniak : Hi, good morning. Eric, would love a little more color on the decision to align FSD and FMT under one leader. Does that indicate sort of maybe potentially more divestitures as you kind of look to refine the portfolio going forward; just any thoughts there? Eric Ashleman : No. I'd appreciate the question. What I was really trying to emphasize in the remarks is we were looking for a leader with frankly experience, scale and depth of experiences and in the broad reach, which would line-up well with where we want to go as a company. And so that that by sort of combining those businesses at least under her watch, it allows us to essentially position the skill, attract somebody of that caliber and put somebody on the team that's honestly got some experience in some of the areas where we want to go. That it's completely about that. Everything else underneath Melissa is identical to what we've seen before. We've kept it very separate and distinct. We run it exactly the same, but it allows one person to come onto the team with some very, very good capabilities. Allison Poliniak : Great. And then Bill just going back to the HST orders, I think you kind of alluded to the fact that they were just \u2013 there were some orders that were essentially just pushed into to Q4. Have they been executed on? Have they turned into orders or is it something we're still leading to come forward here? Bill Grogan : Yes. No, not yet. The teams are still negotiating final pricing for things going in the next year. So if we get them in Q4, first part of Q1, we'll get them. It's just a matter of timing. Allison Poliniak : Great, thank you. Bill Grogan : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. Brett Linzey : Hi. Good morning all. Eric Ashleman : Hi Brett. Brett Linzey : Hey. I was hoping you might be able to parse out how you're thinking about accretion this year in next on a carryover basis for the two recent acquisitions, Muon and KZ? Bill Grogan : In terms of incremental eps? Brett Linzey : Yeah. So EPS accretion baked into the guide for this year and then what you're thinking about for next year carryover? Bill Grogan : This year it's just a couple cents here in the back half. And then we'll have a couple of cents there in the, in the first half of next year is it'll comp as we progress in the Q3 and Q4. Brett Linzey : Okay, great. And then I was hoping maybe you could just give a little bit of color on the regional dynamic within orders and then specifically, what the pace of that looked like through the \u2013 through the quarter on a monthly basis and what you're seeing in October in Europe specifically? Bill Grogan : I'm sorry, Brett, the cadence of orders within each month in the third quarter? Brett Linzey : Yes. I was thinking more on a regional basis what the cadence of monthly orders was and how that progressed into October as well by the different regions? Bill Grogan : I would say the third quarters got some seasonality historically relative to European holidays and slowness within August. Relative to normal order patterns there weren't anything that was a significant outlier relative to what we've seen over the years. As Eric talked about, fundamental orders in our book and ship businesses were strong throughout the quarter. That continued to be strong here in October. Most of the softness, like we said, a little bit on the book and ship stuff in Europe and then some of the project related business and some of the ordering was probably the, the bigger item within our European geographical look; North American-Asia still remain really, really strong. Eric Ashleman : And October pretty consistent with what we saw on Q3. Brett Linzey : Okay, great. I'll pass it along. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Johnson with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Thomas Johnson : Hi. Thanks. Congratulations on the strong quarter. I just had a question on kind of near-term results here specific to the HST business you provided some pretty helpful commentary for us on some of those main drivers, the lower productivity and some of the discretionary investments that offset volume and improving price cost from a margin standpoint in 3Q. So it would be helpful if there is any way that you could kind of quantify how that impacted EBIT margins on a sequential basis? Just trying to think through the evolution from 2Q to 3Q from those headwinds? And maybe how you see that progressing moving through the remainder of the year. Bill Grogan : Yes. I'd probably highlight to some of the productivity challenges as we ramped on some of the higher tech stuff in a couple of businesses within HST. Yes, sequentially, it was down versus the second quarter. We think it will ramp back up here as the business continues to progress and normalize and get more efficient in several of the facilities that we'll see a pickup in the fourth quarter. Thomas Johnson : Great. Thanks. That's all for me. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Vlad Bystricky with Citi Group. Please proceed with your question. Vlad Bystricky : Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the call. Eric Ashleman : Hey Vlad. Vlad Bystricky : Hi. So can you just talk about \u2013 you've obviously talked throughout the recovery about taking some share, given your ability to service customers and your availability. So as we're starting to see supply chain constraints gradually ease, can you talk about how you expect share trends to evolve as some of your competitors who were maybe more hamstrung at times or coming back more online to normalize service levels? Eric Ashleman : Sure. Well, there is probably two elements of there I want to cover. There is one that I would argue we kind of carry most days. We generally have shorter lead times than a lot of the people we compete against when things are in normal state. I mean, we\u2019ve engineered the businesses to run that way and its kind of all set up there. What's actually happened for us here with a lot of the share capture over the last couple of quarters is we made some really sharp calls on some inventory that's pretty specific, highly technical and not in wide supply. We could see some things come in the businesses to their credit without frankly approval loops and things that we don't need in a company like ours, they said, hey, we know how critical this is, we can kind of see where it's going to go, we're going to lay some in. And so almost all of the share capture that we talk about, you can kind of take it right back into very specialized material that we accumulated. So I think that's important because otherwise you might just think it's very benign stuff and metal bits and brackets and things like that where we just have to have them laying around. That actually would normalize as things improve. This is actually very, very strategic inventory that these businesses accumulated. So that's an advantage state out of the gate. That's what we're largely referring to here. But then as we go and things normalize, we normalize and maintain that advantage, the natural advantage we have in many of our businesses. So it\u2019s just an area that we always emphasize. It's kind of been dramatically positive for us because of really, really good choices in businesses. Vlad Bystricky : Okay. That's really helpful color. And then maybe just as we think about organic sales obviously you have surprised to the upside here over the past couple of quarters and just raised your 2022 organic growth outlook. So, can you just maybe parse out a little more, what's driving that better top line growth? How much of it is incremental, better pricing than you expected versus just better volume-driven growth? Eric Ashleman : Well, yes, I mean, there are certainly components of outperformance that are here. So, I'm glad that you are bringing that up. I mean, our pricing is the highest level we've had out throughout the year. We've been pushing that continuously. This is the kind of environment where our differentiated products are going to command the highest level of pricing. So, that is no doubt a component and it's competitively advantaged.  We talk a lot about the top bets in the company, the top best growth bets. They are of the highest quality we've had. And so interspersed in all of the numbers that we're talking about, you see great things like broadband, and outer space and things we're doing in genomics and some of the things going on in water and precision ag and through FMT and now some acceleration that we've been waiting for and the Fire businesses and FSD, so those bets are layered in with higher unit of measures than we've seen historically on top of recovering markets and well-positioned businesses. That's kind of the entitlement that we have. Really strong price capture and a great stack up of \u2013 that's across the company. Vlad Bystricky : That's helpful. Great quarter. Thank you guys. Eric Ashleman : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question. Rob Wertheimer : Good morning everyone. Eric Ashleman : Good morning. Rob Wertheimer : So, I just have a general question. I wonder if you might tell, I guess, the story of Muon Group acquisition and how it sheds by the new process, multiples and other opportunities you have, whether it soaks up a lot of the availability or whether you are still active. Just kind of walk through how obviously you've had pretty strong success and acquisitions lately, and that's been a focus and I'd just like to get color and how that transpired. Eric Ashleman : Yes. Well, it's a business we've known for a few years. It's very much an IDEX business. I mean, it's a highly precise, niche component doing wonderful jobs for a variety of high-end markets, including the ones that we had identified in the prepared remarks. I gave a lot of credit to Marc Uleman, who I referenced in my opening remarks. It's a Netherlands-based business. Marc is located in the Netherlands, and he kept a very active cadence with this team over the last few years. We found a time and a space where we were able to generate some actionability and got the deal done mainly because we could get our head around it very, very quickly based on the work we've done over the last few years and our familiarity with it. What's great about a business like this one is, and the reason I say it's so IDEX-like, is it's actually very tuneable. It's one of the reasons we like these precise components businesses. So, it pings into some very high quality areas of semicon, there is some great applications in medical devices, food production, high-end food production, all areas that we study and participate in across the business. So we can leverage that insights and then apply it on a high quality niche business like this one. Longer, turn down the road this actually sits next to a lot of things we have in our Scientific Fluidics & Optics. So there is some commercial relationships that we could leverage there. There is actually some very interesting technical questions and things that we're going to explore together over a longer duration. And then honestly, when we think of value creation, we start to apply the way we run things at IDEX. You can take a high quality business like that, we would start with 80-20. It's not all applications are created equal. We have a way of thinking about that that we can teach to others, things like value capture with customers. I mean, we do that really well. And so there is a whole bunch of leverageable assets as well, just that you apply against an already very, very strong business that's got a demonstrated history of growth. So, I think, we're really, really excited about it. I think it's indicative of the kind of things that we're looking at and looking for. And yes, we'll see, we'll certainly talk to you about it as we go. Bill Grogan : And then, Rob, your capacity comment, I mean, after the completion of Muon, we'll have spent about a $1.5 billion over the last two years with really taking on a minimal amount of incremental leverage. So we'll have a $1.5 billion to spend here over the next 12 months with a robust funnel, lot of actionable assets within that funnel. Rob Wertheimer : No, that was a comprehensive answer. Thank you. Any commentary on whether that's an abnormally large asset within your funnel, whether it's peppered through a big and small? And with that I will stop. Eric Ashleman : Yes. No, I mean, it's a little larger than we've seen before. But I mean, the nature of these kind of high quality niches, they tend to be in very similar spaces and the kind of the top end of the size of them is actually relatively constant across even the wide variety of businesses that we have. So, a well-positioned business that's closer to the top end in a high quality niche like we think about is often this size. So it's a little higher than we've seen before but there is certainly more of them like it out there. Rob Wertheimer : Great. Thank you. Eric Ashleman : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question. Matt Summerville : Thanks. Just a couple quick ones here. With FSD how far behind is that business in terms of price cost, meaning, how much more margin can we look forward to as you fully close that gap? And then sticking with that business on the dispensing side, how much of a revenue whole should we expect in 2023 from those big projects that have revenue this year? And then I have one follow-up. Eric Ashleman : Sure. I think we look for FSD to continue its ramp. We had said last quarter had bottomed out, it will continue to progress as we move forward. With the caveat that we still need to assess the project funnel for next year for dispensing. Right now we don't think there is a huge hole. There will be some softness on the replenishment side. If we weren't able to fill some of those larger projects that would put a little bit of pressure on FSD\u2019s margins relative to the progress that fire and rescue has made. So right now we're still evaluating the impact of what the project funnel is for dispensing and obviously give you more detail here as we get into the guide in January. Matt Summerville : And then just a modeling question. The divestiture, the Knight divestiture can you disclose the financial profile of that business? Bill Grogan : Yes, I mean, it was less than 1% of revenue and obviously a non-material, non-profit for us. Matt Summerville : Got it. That's all for me. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Loop Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Scott Graham : Yes, hi. Good morning all. And congratulations on another standout quarter. I have questions. Just sort of a broad based question on organic first. With the supply chain improving a little bit \u2013 several quarters ago, Eric, you were able to take your best guess at quantifying what the negative was. With the improvement in the chain can you maybe quantify what the positive was on organic this quarter? Eric Ashleman : I mean, from a share capture and things we're able to do, I mean\u2026 Scott Graham : Well actually trying to maybe share capture is part of it sure. But kind of more like backlog, depletion, things getting out, that were hung up in backlog that maybe you didn't expect, I'm assuming that there was a bit additive to organic from a better chain. Eric Ashleman : I think it's a small amount. Scott, I think, we've stabilized relative to our production output levels as you look at where we've been from a revenue perspective, it's slightly elevated. So, a point or two at most, we've burned a little bit of backlog the quarter, but backlog position is still pretty high. Bill Grogan : Pretty high. It was a pretty minor burn there. Scott Graham : Got you. Okay, great. That was helpful. Thank you. Also, and I hope this doesn't count as a follow-up. What was pricing I didn't hear it if you said it? Bill Grogan : No. We didn\u2019t. Second quarter we were at 4%. We ramped here in the third little over 5%. Scott Graham : Okay. Thank you. And then just a question about the water business. It's a pretty big business. You called it out as a certainly an area of strength. Can you kind of talk about the dynamics of the growth in the quarter? Is that a market that maybe would be a clear sort of green shoot market for you next year as well? Eric Ashleman : I mean, it's a good market. I always remind people that the work that we do there is on the analytical side of supporting whether the infrastructure\u2019s ability to work well. So that kind of work, I mean it maps well with a lot of the digital solutions that are out there. That's where some of our more digital businesses are. So robot crawlers and flow monitoring to prevent overflows and things that could harm the environment, that's the work that we're doing. The bulk of it. Of course, made an acquisition to deepen that here recently. So we've got some very good assets that in. We think long-term, obviously there is no question the work needs to be done. It's long overdue. There is a decent amount of stimulus and government support that's out there that always takes longer to find its way into projects than people imagine. But that frankly extends it over multiple years or two. So, just we kind of put that in a positive side. I would agree on the green shoot side of it. We are very, very well positioned. We're continuing integration work with the acquisition that we have to deepen all of it in our major geographies. And we view it as very favorable. Scott Graham : Got it. Okay, thanks again. Eric Ashleman : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Michael Anastasiou : Good morning, this is Michael on for Joe. Eric Ashleman : Hi, Michael. Michael Anastasiou : In the prepared remarks you mentioned strength around energy. Can you just dive a bit into the LNG outlook for FMT and if there is any future alternative energy opportunities? I know historically that's been an area of inorganic growth. Eric Ashleman : Yes, well, I think, our energy businesses have recovered pretty nicely throughout the year. I mean, we've seen a few \u2013 we don't have a ton of upstream presence, but that's been stronger here lately. I think the midstream has got some delays and things on the project side and supply chain, some of the classic stuff, but probably lines up behind it, because there are some things that are overdue there. I mean we've got kind of a classic custody transfer business, a lot of it is fossil fuel dependent with the current assets. A lot of that technology, we're actually asking all the questions, as you might imagine, of how transferable it is to other alternate energy sources and things that might be out there. Whatever it is, whether it's hydrogen or some other gases and liquids, it's going to need \u2013 people are going to need to get paid and we're going to need to measure that custody transfer happens. And that's kind of work that we long have done and are excited about. There are actually other areas of IDEX that map against some of those same vectors in a way that's probably would strike folks in the outside is kind of unusual as well. That's one of the ways we think of a trend like that is we kind of draw lines and tentacles into different verticals within IDEX and then we sort of leverage insight around how the work is done, how things are shaping up, and then distribute it across a variety of IDEX businesses that might be involved. They may not be going to market together, they might not even be in the same room, but actually some of the same dynamics are meaningful for them in terms of why they would want to invest in it. So it's an area of interest for us in terms of how this will ultimately play out over time. But I think for now the kind of core things that we have are doing pretty well with a decent road and runway ahead. Michael Anastasiou : Thanks, that's helpful. And just in one follow-up if I may. Are there any product adjacencies that within the energy sphere that you see more favorable? And if this is something that's sort of in the funnel for the next 12 months or so? Eric Ashleman : I mean, we got some great projects there. They, as you might imagine, go very, very niche very, very quickly. As an example, we've got a great application that makes sure that when you offload a rail car with propane you get all of it out of the bottom. I mean, seems kind of funny, you did suspect, everybody would suspect that actually happens, it doesn't. So our team developed something that guarantees that 100% of the fuel is taken out of the car, and then that's available as productivity for a variety of people. So it's that kind of work that's sort of the \u2013 that's the unit of measure of things we think about and develop for customers. And there are others along the way, but that's just one we happen to take a look at about a month ago that's really, really interesting. Michael Anastasiou : Thank you. Operator : That's all the time we have for questions. I would like to hand a call back to management for closing remarks. Eric Ashleman : Well, thanks. I appreciate the comments and the reflection on what we think was a very strong quarter here. For any of the IDEX team members are listening, I want to thank you all again personally for your hard work. Certainly difficult circumstances, a lot of change happening quarter-over-quarter, month-over-month. But as I said in the end of my remarks, this is a company where we really lean into that. Anytime the world gets difficult, the problem is worth solving. And we solve them, with well positioned businesses, I mean, it's a huge financial benefit for ourselves and our shareholders. So thanks for your interest. Look forward to talking to you more along the way. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And have a wonderful day.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Allison Lausas, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer. Thank you. You may begin. Allison Lausas : Good morning, everyone. This is Allison Lausas, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for IDEX Corporation. Thank you for joining us for our discussion of the IDEX fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial highlights.  Last night, we issued a press release outlining our company's financial and operating performance for the 3 months and full year ending December 31, 2022. The press release, along with the presentation slides to be used during today's webcast, can be accessed on our company website at idexcorp.com. Joining me today are Eric Ashleman, our Chief Executive Officer and President; and Bill Grogan, our Chief Financial Officer. We will begin with Eric providing an overview of the state of IDEX' business, including a recap of our recent performance. Bill will then provide a segment outlook for 2023 and discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results as well as our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2023. Eric will then close the call with our key priorities for 2023. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. If you should need to exit the call for any reason, you may access a complete replay beginning approximately 2 hours after the call concludes by dialing the toll-free number (877) 660-6853 and entering conference ID 13734461 or simply log on to our company homepage for the webcast replay. Before we begin, a brief reminder. This call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbor language in last night's press release and in IDEX's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  With that, I'll now turn this call over to our CEO and President, Eric Ashleman. Eric Ashleman : Thank you, Allison, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 6. 2022 was a record year for IDEX. We experienced double-digit organic growth every quarter, driving all 3 of our segments to record sales levels and achieved strong record profitability, driven by solid execution. This year was not without its challenges. We experienced unprecedented inflation as well as a difficult supply chain environment. Despite these obstacles, we achieved some of the strongest financial results we've ever posted. I'd like to thank our IDEX employees around the globe for their efforts and hard work. We also deployed more capital than ever before, investing in our businesses, acquiring new ones and returning capital to our shareholders. We deployed a record $950 million for the acquisitions of Nexsight, KZValve and most recently, the Muon Group. We reinvested back into our core business to increase capacity to support growth and drive productivity and made investments in the commercial engineering and M&A resources that enable us to execute on our best opportunities. We also repurchased 795,000 shares of IDEX stock for $148 million as we followed our opportunistic disciplined approach to buybacks. As we turn to 2023, we are prepared to build upon a very solid foundation. We have strong backlog positions overall, and we continue to leverage innovative technologies to drive targeted growth opportunities. We have healthy price carryover in addition to new price actions to capture the value our products bring to our customers. Finally, we have an opportunity to drive strong productivity as we bring process-driven normalcy back to our operations through the application of the IDEX operating model. However, we're a short-cycle business and with that comes limited visibility. The broad-based supply chain constraints experienced last year have created some new dynamics around order patterns and customer delivery timing. And we predict that 2023 will be an uncertain period of transition as we dynamically calibrate with our customers. Additionally, there are likely to be pockets of demand softness due to a variety of intersecting economic and geopolitical factors. Regardless of these challenges, we will execute and deliver growth above-market entitlements. The short cycle and decentralized nature of our business supports quick adaptation and alignment to shifting conditions. And we will course-correct quickly and effectively when needed. Our balance sheet has ample capacity to support our M&A strategy as well as organic reinvestment. Our extended M&A and strategy team continues to build conviction around our best opportunities, and our funnel is strong and of high quality. We've also identified areas where we will deploy capital organically to expand capacity, capture market share and drive operational productivity. IDEX had a strong finish to an outstanding year in 2022. Our agility, resiliency and our fundamental ability to execute has IDEX exceptionally well positioned to outperform as we move forward.  With that, I'll turn it over to Bill to discuss the outlook for our segments on Page 7. William Grogan : Thanks, Eric. In our Fluid & Metering Technology segment, industrial day rates were steady in the fourth quarter, and we expect they remain at this level in the near term with strong price support. We've seen initial signs that customers are returning to a book-and-bill order pattern, consistent with pre-pandemic behavior. We continue to monitor day rates to evaluate longer-term expectations as this is our most short-cycle market exposure. We expect another strong year in agricultural business with strong farmer sentiment and high crop prices. We continue to see positive signals from both our OEMs and distributors and a trend towards investing in precision technologies as a means of mitigating higher input costs. We are on our next phase of process automation at Banjo and see continued improvement in delivery and efficiencies putting us in a good position to capture share. Our outlook for our municipal water business continues to be favorable. The healthy quoting activity we experienced over the past few quarters is expected to translate into 2023 growth. And we continue to identify opportunities to leverage our technology to capture new programs. The EPA just received record funding and the Infrastructure Bill could provide a tailwind in the back half of the year. The chemical markets overall are soft. We see opportunities for growth in U.S. green energies and strong project activity in the Middle East, but this is offset by softer European demand due to higher energy costs and cuts to production capacity. In our energy business, we see favorable demand for energy exports and natural gas production as well as continued oil price support. However, customers continue to delay larger investments as they focus on cost, inventory and supply chain issues. The strong price capture and productivity achieved in 2022 as well as new pricing actions in '23 will continue to drive improvements in FMT margins with some risk of offset from lost volume leverage, depending on the second half volumes. Moving on to the Health & Science Technology segment. We expect HST to remain our highest growth segment. Our life sciences and analytical instrumentation businesses will continue to grow in '23 due to strong next-gen sequencing applications and continued expansion of cell-based therapies in various chromatography and mass spec applications. In the short term, however, several of our OEM customers are holding excess inventory, driving volume out of the first quarter and into the balance of the year. We believe this is a short-term issue, and the overall market outlook remains extremely positive for this sector. Our targeted growth initiatives tied to a wide variety of applications from satellites and space, to energy-efficient fuel cells continue to perform well, and our industrial businesses are seeing market trends similar to FMTs. We are seeing some slowing in semiconductor market, driven by higher memory device inventory levels and declining customer chip spending. Fabrication spending and new fab construction are both expected to be down for the year. That said, we provide critical consumable components for a large installed base, which tends to be more stable despite end market and CapEx cycles. Where we play in the market and our recent share gains are expected to drive continued outperformance versus the broader market. We are seeing overall signs of slowing demand in pharma and biopharma, particularly around larger projects. Customers are hesitant to make larger investments given inflation and higher interest rates. India continues to accelerate and the easing of China restrictions could drive growth and recovery in the region to offset some. Lastly, our auto business is expected to perform well. Global auto production is stable, and our presence in premium vehicle segments in EV and hybrids is driving a faster recovery as compared to the overall market. HST margins will expand in '23 due to pricing, productivity and volume, partially offset by continued reinvestment in our highest growth businesses and some mix headwinds in the short term due to expected life science AI demand patterns. Finally, we expect our Fire Safety and Diversified Products segment will experience growth towards the lower end of our guided range. In fire safety, U.S. and European fire OEM volumes remain constrained by supply chain and throughput issues, but backlogs are strong and volumes are steady. We expect continued share gain with smaller builders that are coming online to capture surplus demand. Our rescue business remains positive with strong NPD, and we continue to leverage our integrated model to drive distribution growth. We expect our Banjo business to continue to outperform across industrial, automotive and energy markets as it leverages its inventory and differentiation to capture share. Finally, our dispensing business has achieved strong results for the last 2 years, but will be down in 2023, driven by lower North American project volume as customer equipment refresh cycles approach their final innings. We continue to see growth in India, offset by some moderating demand in Europe and Southeast Asia. For the segment, we expect price cost and operational productivity will drive margin expansion with some offset for mix as we see lower dispensing project volume in the segment. With that, I'll discuss our financial results. Moving on to our consolidated financial results on Slide 9. Q4 orders of $803 million, were up 1% overall and up 1% organically. We experienced continued orders growth in FMT, driven by strong water and energy results and an FSD due to strong fire and rescue orders as well as the receipt of a large project order for dispensing in the quarter. HST orders were down 8%, mainly due to the life science and AI OEM orders and softer semi demand I highlighted earlier. For the year, orders were up 8% overall and up 5% organically. We experienced positive orders growth across all 3 of our segments. Fourth quarter sales of $811 million, were up 13% overall and up 12% organically. We experienced nearly 20% organic growth in HST and strong growth across both FMT and FSD. Full year sales of $3.2 billion, were up 15% overall and up 13% organically. We saw strong double-digit growth across FMT and HST and 9% growth in FSD. Q4 margin contracted by 140 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 and adjusted gross margin of 43.6% contracted by 40 basis points. This was driven by unfavorable mix within HST and FSD, the dilutive impact of acquisitions, employee-related inflation and unfavorable productivity in HST, partially offset by volume leverage and strong price cost. For the full year, gross margins expanded by 50 basis points, and adjusted gross margins expanded by 10 basis points to 44.8%, primarily driven by strong volume leverage, positive price/cost and productivity, more than offsetting employee-related inflation and engineering resource investments. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 27%, up 10 basis points versus 2021. A bridge of Q4 adjusted EBITDA as well as Q4 adjusted operating income can be found in the appendix of this presentation. Full year adjusted EBITDA margin of 27.9%, is up 20 basis points versus 2021's adjusted EBITDA of 27.7%. This represents record profitability for IDEX. I will discuss the drivers of full year adjusted EBITDA on the next slide. Our Q4 effective tax rate of 20.5%, decreased versus last year's effective tax rate of 22.5%, primarily due to tax benefits realized as we recognize certain foreign currency impacts for tax purposes with the funding of the Muon Group acquisition. Our full year effective tax rate of 21.7% also included tax benefits from the sale of our Knight business and was down from the 2021 effective tax rate of 22.5%. Fourth quarter net income was $130 million, which resulted in an EPS of $1.71 Adjusted net income was $153 million, with an adjusted EPS of $2.01, which was up $0.30 or 18% over prior year. Full year net income was $587 million, which resulted in an EPS of $7.71. Adjusted net income was $618 million, resulting in an EPS of $8.12, up $1.25 or 18% over prior year adjusted EPS. Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $147 million, 96% of adjusted net income, mainly driven by improved working capital performance. For the year, free cash flow was $489 million, down 1% versus last year and coming in at 79% of adjusted net income. mainly driven by higher net working capital, partly offset by higher income. As we exit the year, we made progress in reducing core business inventories and have momentum behind us to continue to drive further reduction into next year. Moving on to Slide 10, which details the drivers of our total year adjusted EBITDA. Full year adjusted EBITDA increased $119 million compared to 2021 and Our 13% organic growth contributed approximately $91 million flowing through at our prior year gross margin rate. We levered well on the volume increase and had record price capture to offset record inflation. Price/cost was accretive to margins and has returned to historic levels. As we exited the year, all 3 of our segments posted positive price/cost results. We drove operational productivity to offset supply chain-driven inefficiencies and realized the benefits of our energy and Italian site consolidations. Mix was a small positive for the year. We saw unfavorable mix pressure in the fourth quarter of about $3 million that were reversed a majority of the year-to-date favorability. We invested $20 million taking in the form of engineering and commercial resources in the business and M&A and diversity equity inclusion resources in corporate. Tracking to the lower end of the $0.20 to $0.25 of full year spend we highlighted at the beginning of the year. Discretionary spending increased by $25 million versus last year, closer to the high end of the $0.20 to $0.25 range on significantly higher sales than our original guide. We exited the year with a solid 30% organic flow-through. ABEL, Nexsight, KZValve and Muon acquisitions, net of the Knight divestiture and FX contributed an additional $14 million of adjusted EBITDA. Inclusive of acquisitions, divestitures and FX, we also delivered 30% flow-through. With that, I would like to provide an update on our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2023. I'm on Slide 11. We expect full year organic revenue growth to be in the range of 1% to 5%. This range reflects the uncertainty in the second half of the year given the short-cycle nature of our business. This organic growth rate equates to $0.12 to $0.60 depending on the top line results. This range includes price cost, which we anticipate will be positive for the year and some mix pressure stemming from HST and dispensing volume in FSD. We expect that our operational productivity will more than offset pressure from employee-related wage and benefits inflation. We operated in a challenging supply chain environment in 2022, and we expect the easing of these conditions as well as driving our own internal productivity funnel will deliver $0.06 to $0.08 of net productivity for the year. In 2022, we returned to a more sustainable level of discretionary spending post-pandemic and invested in the people needed to drive our strategy. Travel and external services did not fully rebound until the second quarter of 2022. And we hired an increasing rate as we move through the year. Although our spend is only moderately increased versus our 4Q exit rate, we'll see pressure of approximately $0.09 on a year-over-year basis. This impact is entirely felt in the first quarter of 2023. Although not to the same level as in 2022, we will continue to invest for the future. People, new products as well as applications for existing products, and these investments will provide up to $0.20 of pressure in 2023, depending on top line results. The range indicates how we will focus on resource allocation and an uncertain period and dial in our investments appropriately. Net of the divestiture of our Knight business last year, we expect acquisitions to contribute $168 million of revenue and $0.43 of EPS. Now let's look at a couple of non-operational items. Interest expense associated with the Muon acquisition represents a headwind of $0.12, and we expect FX to be a small impact, providing $0.02 of EPS pressure. So in summary, we are projecting organic revenue growth of 1% to 5% for the year, adjusted EPS expectations are in the range of $8.50 to $8.80, a 5% to 8% growth over 2022. The midpoint of our guidance implies a solid 30% adjusted EBITDA flow-through. Moving on to Slide 12. We I'll now provide some additional details regarding our 2023 guidance for both the first quarter and full year. In the first quarter, we are projecting GAAP EPS to range from $1.74 to $1.79 and adjusted EPS to range from $1.98 to $2.03, with organic revenue of 3% to 5% and adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 27%. Our guidance includes $0.07 of pressure from accelerated recognition of share-based compensation as well as a delay in HST OEM shipments to the latter part of the second quarter that is lowering our organic growth expectations for the quarter. These factors, plus the carryover item I mentioned on the previous slide, mutes our year-over-year flow-through for the quarter, but expect to deliver solid flow-through for the year. Turning to the full year 2023. We project GAAP EPS of $7.55 to $7.85 and adjusted EPS to range from $8.50 to $8.80. We expect full year organic revenue growth of 1% to 5% and adjusted EBITDA margins to be 28% or higher. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be about $70 million, in line with 2022 spending as we continue to identify opportunities to reinvest in our core businesses. And free cash flow is expected to be 100-plus percent of adjusted net income.  With that, I'll turn it back to Eric. Eric Ashleman : Thanks, Bill. I'm on the final slide, Slide 13. Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to wrap up with a summary of our 2023 focus areas. First, we are refocusing our efforts on a foundational set of practices and tools that link us together the IDEX operating model as we exit 2 intense years of double-digit organic growth within an environment of temporal barriers and obstacles. This is a year to double down on the core execution elements that make us an excellent company. The use of daily management, monthly business reviews, goal deployment and other tools have long been a source of efficiency, innovation and growth for IDEX as market conditions, particularly within supply chains, begin to return to historic norms, we must seize the opportunity to optimize our process-driven fundamental business practices to best support future growth and outperformance. Second, we are committed to growing our talent at an even faster rate to fuel future IDEX growth. Our excellent execution is led by incredible leaders around the world who are committed to our core values to developing top-performing talent and creating an inspiring company culture that attracts and retains the best people. Diversity, equity and inclusion continues to be an area of focus, creating environments where people feel they belong and are comfortable bringing their true selves to work each and every day. One talent note I want to address is the recent departure of Melissa Aquino. If you recall from our last session together, I introduced her as the new leader of the FMT and FSD segments. Melissa made a difficult decision to go back to a previous employer to take an opportunity she felt she could not pass up. We wish her well in her new endeavors and continue the search for her replacement. In the meantime, the gap has allowed me to step in, get closer to our businesses and spend time with an outstanding group of business leaders. Lastly, we've deployed $1.5 billion over the last 2 years on high-quality growth businesses, and we look forward to deploying additional capital in 2023. Our M&A teams have made tremendous progress identifying compelling portfolio extensions. Our funnel is in the best shape it's been over my tenure at IDEX and our strong operating cash flow and balance sheet put us in a great position to continue to capitalize on those opportunities. Although the short-term economic picture might be uncertain, I could not be more excited as I consider the next few years of our story. I believe we're headed into an extended period of growth and above-market performance fueled by a combination of technology-driven tailwinds and our own high-quality business potential. Our businesses are first rate, our teams are outstanding, our culture is special. With that, let me pause and turn it over to the operator for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Allison Poliniak : I just want to go back to your comment on optimizing processes and how we should think about that inventory is certainly a one that's been a target just because you've had to build it up to deal with some of the supply chain issues. But maybe a little bit more color about how you're thinking about that. Eric Ashleman : Yes. And that's probably the area with the best example. We're coming off an environment where a lot of even the best intentional processes kind of turn into chasing things, looking for parts and waiting for the truck to come in at noon, all of that kind of stuff. So as that moderates and gets better, we just want to be intentional to make sure that we're going back and putting in those process-based fundamentals, the right people in the right room, having the right kind of conversations. That's actually how we're going to -- we frankly made a nice turn here in the fourth quarter on inventory. We got a long way to go, but we're really excited about that potential for us moving forward. But I think it's just -- I think everybody should be very thoughtful of recognizing that the way things have worked the last couple of years, if you're not intentional about reorienting it back to something that operates in a higher plane, it's going to lag. And so we're taking that opportunity. Allison Poliniak : Got it. And then just turning to free cash flow, still a little bit below historical performance for IDEX in terms of that conversion. Is it really just that inventory holding it back? I would say, what would be the lever to drive it higher at this point and sort of back to normal for you guys? William Grogan : Yes. So in the fourth quarter, we talked to the third quarter inventory stabilized. It wasn't a detriment to cash flow. Here in the fourth quarter, it added about $20 million of free cash flow, the movement we made on our position, and we continue to see that momentum. I think we've got line of sight to a half a turn to a full turn of inventory improvements as we progress through the year. It will be a significant driver of our cash flow performance as we go from, obviously, less than historical averages on our free cash flow conversion to last year being 100-plus percent, which will yield somewhere between 30% and 40% increase in free cash flow year-over-year. So I think that's a huge win as we progress through the year. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Halloran with Robert W. Baird. Michael Halloran : So a couple of questions here. First on the guidance. Obviously, the commentary on the first quarter and some pushouts, plus a lot of the commentary about basically expected volatility through the year. How have you cadence that guidance? Is it relative to normal seasonality? I mean how do you think about first half, back half versus a normal year? Not that we've had a lot of normal years lately, but any kind of context you give to how you're thinking about what that cadencing looks like and how much kind of caution maybe you've put in there given what that backdrop looks like? William Grogan : Yes. I think we're generally first half, second half is fairly close, 49, 50, 51, 49, something like that. So this year, I think the implied guide is a stronger first half with volume starting to decline in the back half. We've got pretty strong price carryover and price capture that will put in place here in the first quarter that will carry at least the price side. And then just the implied volumes in the back half are down somewhere between 2% to 4%. Michael Halloran : Great. That's helpful. Makes sense. And then the comment on order volatility expected is the -- essentially the booking to shipment time period compresses or return to normal. Are you essentially suggesting that you're going to be seeing some pretty volatile order patterns in a year, but maybe a little bit more linear demand patterns as we work through the year relative to the kind of front half, back half comments you just made, Bill? Is that basically a warning sign for -- in your view for what those order rates might be, but don't over extrapolate relative to the underlying demand? William Grogan : Yes. No, I think that's well said. I mean it's a recalibration year, just like we had dynamic recalibration on the way up and recovery from the pandemic and supply chain issues and things like that, stimulus. Now we -- I think we're going to be returning to more normal patterns. But given the nature of IDEX, that's liable to play out at differentiated rates. So we see some more of it, as you'd expect, in some of those OEM-centric markets within HST, where we're a lot closer to the customer. It's more high velocity anyways. And you can see a bit of a pause there to take a breath, take some inventory out of their system. And then those are healthy markets on the other side of them. Some of our industrial businesses that are a little further away from the end customer, lots of distribution between us and them, lots more fragmentation. I think you'll see some of those same things play out over time, but probably a little further down the road. And so what we're kind of expecting here is that from a high level, you'll see things return to more normal rates were off in the backlog or the order rates and the sales rates are pretty tightly linked for us, unless we're sort of beginning or ending the cycle. But I think that what's a little unusual here is just the way it will play out. The nature of it, given just the differentiated pockets of IDEX, and so we're prepared for all of that. What we're trying to do on one side is look at it, adjust to it, course correct, but then always looking on the other side so that we don't over interpret something in the short end. Think it means something that's sustainable for 2, 3 years when it doesn't, and we keep resources aligned in places that have the best growth prospects for us. Michael Halloran : Appreciate that. One quick one, just a clarification. Slide 7 with the arrows within the range. Are those arrows implying high end and lower of the range for the HST and FSD? Or are you suggesting a little bit above, a little bit below and then the green clarification? William Grogan : Yes, exactly. HST on the high end of the range, FMT in the middle and then FSD at the lower end of the range. Michael Halloran : Got it. But still the range. Operator : Our next question is from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Nathan Jones : I'm just going to -- I'm going to follow up on Mike's question -- last question there and follow up on this recalibration of orders and things like that. IDEX doesn't typically have a lot of inventory, a lot of channels. But I'm sure there are some pockets of the business where there are some inventory in new channels. How are you thinking about the potential for your customers to destock some of their inventory and for that to be a pause in demand for you guys? Is that something that you baked into that down 2% to 4% volume in the second half? Eric Ashleman : Yes. I mean there's definitely some of that in there. I think, as you know, we're kind of low on the food chain. We do a lot of component work for people who then turn it into subsystems in terms of the final system. So at any point, along that food chain, there's the potential for accumulation and then frankly, the normalization of it along the way. I think what we're thinking about, though, is when you think of how order patterns are generated many of them are actually done in an automated way. There actually isn't a lot of human intervention. And the two factors that drive it, the most are, of course, lead times and whether or not they're pulling in, and we're seeing that. We're seeing that kind of across the supply base. We're experiencing as well. A factor a lot of people don't consider as much though is volatility or variability. And so even when lead times are pulling in, if you still have an inability to count on it, it will tend to keep driving higher demand requirements throughout the system. So we're kind of monitoring both of those. And as any one of them comes to something more normal, almost always, you're going to see an impact on that on the other side for a short cycle business like ourselves. I don't think it's a massive number because, as you say, most of the things we make are customized and they don't stock well anyways. But we're coming off a pretty robust time here. I do think this calibration matters. It will play out over time through much of IDEX. Again, I think the focus for us is to understand it make sure that our own inventory positions and resources are calibrated right, but then be very, very focused on end market demand, what's driving that, what's the actual consumption rate on the other side because that ultimately is what you want to dial in to. Nathan Jones : I think maybe the question on supply chain. I think over the last couple of years, generally, all of these lead times have stretched out. But for IDEX's businesses, the delays have really been up your supply chain because you buy these highly value-added components. So there's a number of steps for them to go through. And as they compress, that's compressing the order to ship time. So can you talk about where your supply chain is relative to where it was in 2019 chain? How much better it's got, how much there is still to go? And what your general assumption is now for getting back to something like normal? Does it happen in '23? Does it happen in '24? Eric Ashleman : Yes. Sure. I mean, I would say, in general, it's improved a lot and pretty close to where we were in 2019 with a few commodity exceptions. I'd put probably put electronics still at the top of that list. But frankly, we're not the most electronics intensive business. So it matters, but it's not widespread across the company. I think I would also remind everybody on the call, we have a lot of local supply. So we're typically dealing with people we've known a long time that are not far away all through the kind of the worst of it. In many cases, we were helping them. We were kind of sending people over to figure things out, help improve their flow. It's those kind of relationships. So -- and given that, that sort of topology, these are the kind of companies that can course correct a little better and generally have. I would say we're not yet normalized to 2019 levels all across IDEX. We're definitely past the halfway line. So depending on how the year plays out, you could see us basically articulating a normal condition, I think, closer to year-end, certainly as we begin the next year, absent any other force that we can't see. Operator : Our next question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : I was hoping we could unpack the margins in HST. I know you gave some of the color in the prepared remarks. You certainly had the top line. And -- but you didn't get the margin read-through. It's unlike price/cost was positive. You gave some of the other data points. Was mix a factor? Just -- and how much of this was temporary versus how you expect it to play out the rest of this year? William Grogan : Yes. I think there's 3 things there, Deane. One, we continue to face some of the inefficiencies. We talked about here as we progress through the back half of the year. Some of those businesses have grown 20% and still calibrating on some of the manufacturability of some of this cutting-edge technology that they have. Two was some mix within the portfolio. We talked about some of the short-term OEM pushouts. A lot of that has been kind of our book and ship components that are higher margin. And then the last one, just the addition of Muon, they were only in the portfolio for a month. They were shut down to do a full physical inventory that, that diluted margins a little bit. The Muon on will go away in the first quarter. I think we're making progress on the productivity piece, but the mix, I think, is still a component that we'll experience in the first quarter. Yes, so we've got the volume impact and then that mix carrying through at least through the next 3 months. Deane Dray : Got it. That's helpful. And just expectations on price cost into '23. Is there more pricing initiatives you need to put through? Or is this all-carryover benefit? William Grogan : No. We've got carryover and the incremental pricing actions that we took to kick off the year. Obviously, that's part of our normal process and cadence to continue to capture the value for our products. So I think we're in a really good position from a price cost. We said in the fourth quarter, we're back to historic levels, and we think that will continue here as we progress through the year. If something were to change, obviously, we go back to the customers with an incremental increase, but we're well positioned here as we kick off the year. Deane Dray : Great. Just last question, I'm not sure how specific you can get, and I really appreciate the prepared remarks and some of the earlier questions about fleshing out the transition period year. Just right from the supply chain normalizing changes, order behavior, we get that. But we just saw the ISM taking another step down, orders another step down. With all your short-cycle businesses, this is a great canary in a coal mine company to like gauge lead time changes, and you've given fabulous color here. If we total up the collection of soft pockets of business, is this a demand deterioration you're seeing broadly? Could it be the early signs of it? Or do you feel like these are more temporary? Just kind of step back and say, okay, from seeing these trends, how does it look to you for the businesses that you touch play out for the course of the next couple of quarters? Eric Ashleman : Yes. I'd say, Deane, it's still pretty early. I mean everything we're kind of talking about here near term that there was some exposure in Q4 and some carry into Q1. That's very much a temporal condition and otherwise very active and strong markets where you can see, hey, people are taking a pause for all the reasons that you just suggested. Those bellwethers that we have on the industrial side, most of which their order side is coming through the small order flow side, honestly, those are holding up. We're simply, in some cases, projecting that if you combine a couple of things, we kind of know where those inventory levels are, we know how they think about planning, we know where we are from a lead time perspective. We're saying at some point, we expect we'll have some of that moderation there, but it really isn't in front of us as we sit here today. And then back half of the year is more of a macro call than anything else as we think about kind of floor and top end of the range for all of IDEX. So I think your question is helpful because it helps us kind of parse that we'll at least put out there, hey, we're seeing some of these things from an early indication standpoint, but most of them are in a temporal spot. We can imagine some things that would be bigger pieces of IDEX, more industrial in nature that would kind of follow the same calibration. And then ultimately, like everyone else, we're kind of thinking about where does the future go back half of the year, it's more of a macro question. Deane Dray : Yes. That's exactly the color I was looking for. Very helpful. Operator : Our next question is from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Robert Wertheimer : Your order commentary has been very clear and helpful. And I appreciate it. I'm sorry to sneak in one more on it. But just in general, HST, a vertical that had more excess inventory given some of the, the disruptions across the whole vertical. And then do you have a sense that supply chain has actually gotten a lot better or orders like coming in as people anticipated getting better? I'm just wondering if that's already happened, where people can feel more confidence in lead times, I guess, across the businesses, or whether it's an anticipation of that? And then I had an M&A question, if I could. Eric Ashleman : Okay. Well, I think the first question, I wouldn't say that those businesses in the HST world, have more inventory. I would say that they have more sophisticated planning. I think that we've typically seen in any cycle, there's just -- they're bigger organizations, they're a little bit more formal, they're usually a little quicker to react to cycles. And when they do it, that's a more of a concentrated industry anyways. So it tends to be kind of amplified that way. So there's nothing that tells me that somehow that they're sitting on more than anywhere else. And it's in any way, frankly, unusual from some other patterns we've seen when things change. So I'd say that's number one. Remind me again on the second question, I want to make sure I get the exact essence. You talked about supply chain confidence. Robert Wertheimer : Exactly. Yes. So whether spy chain has already gotten better and that lets people have more confidence in lead times and thus destock a bit or whether that's not happened yet? Eric Ashleman : Yes. No, again, I think, think of it as 2 variables. One is lead time compression, that's absolute. And I think people are seeing that. They're seeing that quoted to them when they call and ask about things. I would say the second component that I mentioned that is important, though, is the performance against those quotations. Neither one of them yet are kind of back to where they need to be. They're both improved, but they both work together. And frankly, that second piece, the one about sort of assurance and delivery against commitments, has a huge psychological impact. And I think it's one of the -- I think it's actually the more powerful of the two. So if people say, hey, it's still longer, but I know I'm going to get it exactly want to ask for it, they'll actually make that move in a more fundamental way. If they're still getting surprised from time to time, that tends to fuel a little bit of this. I'm going to keep some things, I'm going to protect some things. So both are moving. And as we continue to talk through the year, you'll hear us talk about both sides of that. Robert Wertheimer : That was very helpful. Just in general, we've had, I think, a reasonably solid level of deal activity you guys have done great over the last year. Your characterization of buyers market just among potential targets for acquisition and whether PE matters for you guys and whether there's less intense competition there. And I will stop. Eric Ashleman : Yes. I mean -- so in general, our story is a good one here. I mean we've had some good performance over the last couple of years, some great businesses we brought in. I've talked from time to time about the intention of work we've done to sort of build strategic conviction in a really, really formal way that contributes to the basic business intelligence that we have from all the businesses across IDEX. So the things that we control are in a great spot. As we think of them engaging with the outside world, we've always been careful to help people understand that we're fishing in a very high-quality universe that I think, in some ways, holds up and it doesn't move around as much in terms of valuations and even timing of transactions, particularly to do this work well. So -- on the PE front, they're often competing with us for properties like this. They too are attracted to companies like this. And I will say it's probably a little less activity competitively there or people that have been able to raise funding and be in the game. But we've long aspired with this work that we're doing to sort of be ahead of that anyway with cultivation on a proprietary nature, talking to people that we meet at the trade shows, those kind of things so that we're not actually in kind of a classic bake-off with lots of people anyways. It's an efficient market, so it doesn't always happen when it does. I think the dynamic around PE activity is absolutely true. Valuations overall still pretty rich because, again, we're looking for high-quality companies like the last 3 that we've brought into the business. Operator : Our next question is from Scott Graham with Loop Capital Markets. Scott Graham : And Eric, thank you for all that transparency that was great. So the question is -- maybe I missed it because I was writing away because you talk -- saying so many things. Did you tell us what pricing was in the quarter? William Grogan : No, no one asked it. It was over 5%. Scott Graham : And the gap was it that still about like 50-ish? William Grogan : On price cost? Scott Graham : Yes. William Grogan : Yes. We said it was back to our historical level, so right around there. Scott Graham : Okay. And then the carryover for next year, can you tell us what that would be? William Grogan : Yes. I mean overall price next year is somewhere around 3% to 4%, about half of it is carryover. Scott Graham : Got it. So I was just wondering also with the -- thank you, Bill. I was just wondering also with the step-down in the first quarter organic, is that mostly FMT and maybe secondarily, FSD in the organic? William Grogan : No, it's mostly HST. We highlighted just some of the temporal moves from some of the OEMs as they recalibrate order patterns and inventory levels, that's the major driver. Scott Graham : Okay. And then I guess my sort of last question here is also on the M&A environment, I mean, in the past, you guys have sort of talked about what's available and a little bit about the funnel. Is there anything more you can say than what you've already said on M&A? Is that still the spreads been kind of coming in a little bit? Or anything changed? Eric Ashleman : No. I mean, as I said just a minute ago that we're still looking for high-quality properties. Those valuations tend to hold up over time. because of the long track record usually predating our conversation and the expectation you'll have a good trail on the other side. I just think from an availability front, we've got more than ample capacity, even though we've deployed a lot over the last 2 years. The great part of being IDEXX is we generate that capacity each and every day. And then I think our targets, we really have not changed. We kind of are comfortable with a band of about $0.5 billion to $1 billion. And if long considered that to be a good target for us here in the next couple of years, sort of regardless of the cycle and they're generating all the right work to go realize that. Operator : Our next question is from Bryan Blair with Oppenheimer & Company. Bryan Blair : I was wondering if you could offer a little more of a profile on the lung group, maybe a rough breakout of key end market exposures across semi, med tech, food and beverage and others. -- where historical growth rates have been -- how the current market environment impacts '23 expectations and where there's the greatest opportunity to extend or accelerate growth within the IDEXX portfolio going forward? William Grogan : Brian, we said about 2/3 of the business is in those major categories you started with on the medical, semi and food side, the balance in a variety of different applications. We've said it's grown at double digits here the last several years. It's got line of sight to continue to do that here as we progress even with some of the noise out there in the semicon market, where they play in this space is still healthy. They've got innovative technology that they continue to roll out. So we remain bullish on their growth profile both on core products and some of the NPD applications that we've gotten to know a little bit more as we progress through the last couple of months of our ownership. Eric Ashleman : And then really past that, I mean, we did say there's some customer points that we have that they don't have that over time, we think, are interesting and we could exploit those. And that's very interesting things on the kind of codevelopment fronts, but the cycle of those are going to be further out in the future. So this always kind of was a game of capitalizing on the near-term strength and success of that business in those markets with sort of this additive element that we're going to work over time to enrich it with all the IDEXX assets. Bryan Blair : Definitely makes sense. And given the composition of Man Group, the -- from what I can see at least 5 businesses, I'm not certain divisions or platforms they're in. Are there any unique aspects of integration that you would call out? And I guess just to level set, obviously, this is a growth opportunity. But are there cost synergies? Eric Ashleman : I mean, not so much within the IDEXX topology and things like that. I mean some certain things we do to leverage back office and being part of the company. But it's not kind of a classic story of us kind of putting things together and moving plants around. The -- as you often see in businesses like this, I mean a lot of that technology is resident in people. I think the single biggest lever that we anticipate pulling here absent that 1 is 80-20. I mean it's just the implementation of that model. And I can absolutely assure you their profile is very IDEX-like out of the gate, which means there are opportunities there to streamline and simplify it. Bryan Blair : Okay. Excellent. And 1 last one, if I can. You've called out an increase in project activity in municipal water. -- over recent quarters, there's obviously a lot of funding for domestic projects. Are you willing to offer some finer points on that front? How much the project funnel has expanded anticipated 2023 growth? Anything along those lines? Eric Ashleman : Yes. I mean it's -- of course, it manifests itself across a series of franchises and very kind of different technologies that we have. So I would probably just roll back to very, very positive. The quote activity has been strong here at the end of last year continues into this year for all of the dynamics that you're citing, everything from EPA funding and enforcement possibilities, which has always been a catalyst for the businesses that we own now. as well as broader infrastructure support over time, which always takes a little longer to land but also has a potential to extend some of the growth time frames that we're thinking about into the future. So we're well positioned. We're continuing to kind of work those assets together. And then -- and this is an area of focus for us as we think about deploying some capital to. Operator : Our next question is from Brett Linzey with Mizuho Americas. Brett Linzey : Just wanted to come back to the excess OEM inventory comment. Any sense in terms of months or weeks of inventory on hand at those OEs that needs to get worked down? And then -- any color or specific product customer segments that you're referring to there? William Grogan : No. I think from a segment, I think it's most of -- we described within some of the comments within our life sciences and total instrumentation, the folks in that group from a magnitude perspective on what they're holding in from inventory, I wouldn't speak to that other than just conversations with them, there is a calibration period that we're going through. As Eric highlighted earlier in the call, this isn't atypical to what we've seen historically we've gone through really robust cycles of growth. There is a quarter or 2 of recalibration to normalize and then back off. I think as you hear any of the external commentary for those large customers, they are still bullish on their equipment deliveries and the growth that they're going to see in 2023. Brett Linzey : All right. Makes sense. And then just shifting to the resource investment you contemplated for the guide. $0 to $0.20. I mean certainly a wide range given the macro and understand that. But historically, I'd say IDEX consistently invested regardless of the state of the environment. What type of situation really drives you to that lower end? And then maybe just a little color on some of the various projects that are being contemplated there. Eric Ashleman : Absolutely. We always think of investing and investing for the future and investing to grow. One of the great things about a company like ours, though, is we can move things around sideways. -- a lot to help us kind of hit the lower end of that range and still make the right choices for the right businesses. And so whenever you see us talking about stuff like a 0, it's actually still very dynamic here. it's just to be candid, we would take businesses that are in softer parts of the universe, and we would quite intentionally like pull those down, lead them out a lot. And redistribute those costs elsewhere to parts of IDEXX that are stronger, sometimes literally taking the same people. and putting them over in stronger parts of IDEXX. So we actually have that nice optionality down at the lower end of the range, but keeps it all moving and allows us to kind of weather a storm if it happens. Operator : And our final question is from Joe Giordano with Cowen and Company. Joseph Giordano : Just a couple of follow-ups on orders here. So if I look at HST, obviously, the orders there on an organic basis, the weakest across the portfolio, but the growth for the year on revenue expected to be the best. Like -- so when -- at what point kind of as you get through the year, do you need to see orders start to stabilize or start accelerating again before like you get a little bit more concerned about the organic revenue profile going forward. William Grogan : Yes. I think we have a while. HST is our biggest backlog. They've built the most backlog out of the 3 segments. So really comfortable with their position here as we go through the first half of the year. We said this calibration on the OEM inventory levels is generally a quarter maybe it spreads into the second. So we're confident that we're going to see that start to pick up and move as we progress into the back half of the year. Joseph Giordano : And then similar on FMT -- sorry, on diversified dispensing is a headwind this year on a revenue basis, but it looks like orders kind of picked back up to almost essentially peak levels that you saw like a year ago. So are you starting to see that? Like do you feel more comfortable about the visibility? Are those like 24 orders, I guess, essentially for dispensing that you're getting on. William Grogan : No, the Q4 we got for dispensing will book in the second and third quarter of this year. Yes, Dispensing orders were up 25%, but their sales were down 20-plus percent in the fourth quarter. So this is -- that was the 1 last order to give us kind of the full set of visibility to still reasonable performance, but down, that's going to mask a little bit of the strong organic growth that we expect from Fire & Safety and Bandon next year. Joseph Giordano : You'd expect the dispensing orders to move back down -- William Grogan : I mean, sorry, verified orders to move back down from like fourth quarter levels. Joseph Giordano : Yes. Yes, definitely. Operator : We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing comments. Eric Ashleman : Okay. Well, thank you all for joining and listening to our story. And I know there were a lot of moving pieces there in an environment that's got some pluses and minuses and things that are playing out. So I'll keep this really, really simple. I want to, again, thank all the folks from IDEXX. 2022 was a great year. I mean really, really outstanding year, incredible growth, focused on the right things, getting capital to work, and we grew our people, we grew our culture. I think 2020, this is going to be an equally great year, and it really sets us up for the future to come. We talked a little bit in my last framing comments there about the power of execution. We're really excited about that. We think we've got a chance here to go establish even a little bit more competitive advantage as we jump on this and recalibrate to the world to come. So we're all over it. We're doing that actively. And then just as passionately, we've got a number of teams that are thinking about the future, what comes in 5 years, what comes in 10 years, and we're going to make the choices that we have to to capitalize on those too. So -- thanks for your support and interest, and have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.",

And it is now my pleasure to introduce to you, Allison Lausas, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer. Thank you, Allison. You may begin. Allison Lausas : Good morning, everyone. This is Allison Lausas, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for IDEX Corporation. Thank you for joining us for our discussion of the IDEX first quarter 2023 financial highlights.  Last night, we issued a press release outlining our company's financial and operating performance for the 3 months ending March 31, 2023. The press release, along with the presentation slides to be used during today's webcast, can be accessed on our company website at idexcorp.com. Joining me today are Eric Ashleman, our Chief Executive Officer and President; and Bill Grogan, our Chief Financial Officer. Today, we will begin with Eric providing an overview of the state of IDEX's business. Then Bill will discuss IDEX first quarter financial results and update on segment performance in the markets they serve and our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2023. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions.  If you should need to exit the call for any reason, you may access a complete replay, beginning approximately two hours after the call concludes, by dialing the toll-free number 877-660-6853 and entering conference ID 13734462, or simply log on to our company homepage for the webcast replay. Before we begin, a brief reminder. This call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbor language in last night's press release and in IDEX's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  With that, I'll now turn this call over to our CEO and President, Eric Ashleman. Eric Ashleman : Thank you, Allison, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 6. I'd like to start with some key first quarter highlights. We delivered record sales with positive organic growth across all 3 of our segments, $2.09 adjusted earnings per share and strong free cash flow. Our FMT and FSD segments performed exceptionally well, both achieving record sales and strong profitability, offsetting some pressure in our HST segment. Price/cost was positive and above IDEX historical performance.  As we look ahead to Q2 and the balance of the year, our outlook has changed. The last time we spoke, we anticipated short-term volume pressures within life sciences from inventory calibration concentrated in a few select OEM customers. However, as we progressed through the quarter, we saw signals of a broader, more prolonged recalibration within our HST segment, largely centered in our analytical instrumentation, life science, pharma and semiconductor markets. End-market demand is still positive, but we believe our customers have sufficient inventory of our critical components to support their needs in the near term.  Over the past 2 years, we experienced robust growth in HST, with sales up over 30% organically to support strong end-user demand and customer-specific inventory replenishment. But as supply chain conditions improve and the broader demand profile normalizes, our OEM partners are aggressively attacking higher inventory levels, beginning with those suppliers that have demonstrated the quickest returns to pre-pandemic lead times. The sharp and simultaneous nature of this inventory recalibration exceeds all prior historical cycles.  In response, we proactively executed cost reductions to offset a portion of this volume impact. We tailored our approach to the specific challenges in individual businesses as well as broader discretionary costs across the entire company, managing through the short term but not losing focus on our longer-term growth path.  These top line challenges, net of our cost-containment plan, drive $0.25 of adjusted EPS headwind for the year. Therefore, as we noted in our press release, we revised our full year adjusted 2023 EPS guidance from $8.25 to $8.55. Bill will discuss the specifics in greater detail during our segment and guidance updates.  Regardless of these end-market challenges, we remain confident in our ability to deliver total shareholder returns over the long term. Our capital deployment plan remains consistent. We continue to look to M&A as a significant source of value creation. To that end, we announced our intent to acquire Iridian Spectral Technologies for CAD 150 million or approximately USD 111 million. Iridian is a world leader in custom optical filter solutions serving the space, life science and telecommunications markets. Iridian expects fiscal 2023 revenues of CAD 36 million and EBITDA margin in the low-30s range. It is about a 13x EBITDA-trailing deal. And within the IDEX family of businesses, Iridian complements and expands upon the solutions provided by our Scientific Fluidics and Optics businesses within HST. This transaction is expected to close in the second quarter. Iridian will be our sixth acquisition since the beginning of 2021, and we remain bullish on our ability to deploy capital on high-quality assets irrespective of the macro conditions.  The integration of our Muon Group acquisition, which closed in fourth quarter 2022, is progressing well. We've deployed key elements of our operating model, and there continues to be a strong cultural fit between IDEX and Muon as our teams work together to unlock value between our businesses.  Finally, I traveled last week to India to officially open our second plant in the state of Gujarat. It is a world-class facility that effectively doubles our production capacity in the country. Coupled with the opening of our plant expansion in China in late 2022 and our recent commissioning of sales and logistics centers in Singapore and Dubai, we now have a strengthened footprint to attack markets across Asia and the Middle East, a key element of our growth strategy.  With that, I'll turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results. William Grogan : Thanks, Eric. Moving on to our first quarter consolidated financial results on Slide 8. All comparisons are against first quarter 2022, unless otherwise stated. Orders of $826 million were down 4% overall and down 10% organically, mainly driven by the timing of project orders for dispensing in FSD and next-gen sequencing in HST as well as OEM pressure across the life sciences, analytical instrumentation, pharma and semiconductor markets in HST.  Record sales of $845 million were up 13% overall and up 6% organically. We experienced 9% organic growth within our FMT and FSD segments and 3% growth in HST. Gross margin of 45.2% contracted by 40 basis points. This was driven by unfavorable mix, largely centered in HST, the dilutive impact of acquisitions and employee-related inflation, partially offset by favorable price cost and productivity. Adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes $6 million related to accelerated recognition of share-based compensation, was 27.2%, down 140 basis points. I'll discuss the remaining drivers of adjusted EBITDA on the next slide.  Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.2% and was relatively flat compared with our prior effective tax rate of 22.4%. Net income was $140 million, which resulted in EPS of $1.84. Adjusted net income was $159 million with adjusted EPS of $2.09, which was up $0.13 or 7%. The accelerated recognition of share-based compensation that I mentioned earlier lowered adjusted EPS by $0.06. Finally, cash from operations was $148 million and up 86%, primarily due to lower investments in working capital versus last year. Free cash flow for the quarter, which included higher year-over-year capital investment, was $121 million, up 91% versus last year and coming in at 76% of adjusted net income. This represents the strongest first quarter free cash conversion we have experienced in the past 5 years.  Moving on to Slide 9, which details the drivers of our first quarter adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA increased $15 million compared to the first quarter of 2022. Our 6% organic growth contributed approximately $6 million flowing through at our prior year gross margin rate. Price/cost was accretive to margins, and we drove operational productivity that more than offset employee-related inflation. Mix was unfavorable by $3 million, mainly centered in HST due to volume declines in our analytical instrumentation and life science components businesses.  Resource and discretionary spending increased by $8 million. As we noted in our prior guidance, this was carryover from last year. In 2022, we did not return to a sustainable level of discretionary spending until the second quarter. Equally, we ramped up our resource investment spend as we progress through the year. This will come down as part of our cost mitigation plan for the balance of the year.  We had $6 million related to accelerated recognition of share-based compensation due to the timing of certain participants reaching retirement eligibility status. These results yielded a 5% organic flow through. Excluding the impact of accelerated share-based compensation, our organic flow-through was around 20%.  Nexsight, KZValve and Muon acquisitions, net of the Knight divestiture and FX, contributed an additional $13 million of adjusted EBITDA. Inclusive of acquisitions, divestitures and FX, we delivered 16% flow-through. Excluding the impact of accelerated share-based compensation, we delivered 22% flow-through. With that, I'll provide a deeper outlook for our segment performance.  I'm on Page 10. In our Fluid & Metering technology segment, we experienced strong order and sales performance with organic growth of 5% and 9%, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 50 basis points versus last year, driven by strong price/cost, volume leverage and productivity, which more than offset higher employee-related costs and discretionary spending as well as the dilutive impact of acquisitions.  Industrial demand remained steady throughout the quarter. We experienced tailwinds from energy, mining, chemical and lithium-ion battery markets. Our water businesses performed well. Quote activity remained strong due to U.S. infrastructure funding initiatives, and we see continued momentum around the adoption of AI and cloud technologies.  Our energy markets continue to be strong, driven by favorable oil export and mobile truck demand. In the chemical market, we are experiencing wins in the energy transition space as well as strong China and Middle East demand.  The agricultural demand landscape is mixed. Farm fundamentals are positive with stable commodity prices and net farm incomes as well as lower fertilizer costs versus last year. However, distribution inventory levels were higher than typical coming into the planting season, and a slower start to the season due to weather has delayed the turnover of this inventory.  Moving on to the Health & Science Technologies segment. Organic orders contracted 23%, driven by the OEM inventory calibration impact as well as timing of a large next-gen sequencing order we received in the first quarter of last year. As Eric noted, our life science and analytical instrumentation businesses are being impacted by broad-based inventory destocking as our customers recalibrate to a more normalized demand pattern. We expect that these markets will continue to see this pressure through the second quarter with some recovery in the back half of the year.  The semiconductor market is experiencing softness resulting from memory oversupply as well as customers feeling the impact of U.S. export controls. We anticipate that macro conditions will improve as we progress through the remainder of the year. We do continue to leverage share gain to buffer some of the broader market declines.  Our material processing technology business is seeing softness across pharma, biopharma and nutrition markets, driven by tighter capital availability and customer hesitancy due to recession concerns. Our funnel does remain strong, and we expect some recovery in the second half of the year. The automotive market remains positive. We continue to see a solid global trend towards electrification driving opportunities for our growth.  We delivered 3% organic sales growth in the first quarter, driven by strong next-gen sequencing, satellite broadband and fuel cell-targeted growth initiatives with some offset from the market factors I mentioned earlier. Adjusted EBITDA margin contracted by 300 basis points versus the first quarter of 2022. Most of this pressure is in the gross margin line, with unfavorable volume leverage and mix more than offsetting favorable price/cost. The recent Muon acquisition is accretive to HST's overall EBITDA margin. Finally, turning to our Fire & Safety Diversified Products segment. Organic orders contracted by 4%, mainly driven by timing of project orders in our dispensing business last year. Organic sales results were strong at 9% growth, with double-digit growth in both Fire & Rescue and BAND-IT offsetting the decline in dispensing.  Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by 160 basis points versus last year, largely driven by strong price cost performance, volume leverage and productivity more than offsetting higher discretionary spend and employee-related costs. The paint market is mixed, with pressure from the North American replenishment cycle coming to an end and softness in Southeast Asia being offset with strong European and Indian demand. Within our Fire business, demand for trucks remains strong. North American OEM volumes continue to be constrained by supply chain. However, we are gaining share with North American mid-tier and China OEMs with our integrated system strategy and have pivoted our go-to-market approach for our SAM product to retrofit in-service trucks to bypass the OEM backlog constraints.  Our rescue markets are stable, and we have experienced favorable demand in Europe and good project activity across most of the globe. BAND-IT results continue to be positive. Industrial demand is steady, energy is strong, and we continue to drive higher than market performance in automotive due to our position on high-demand vehicles and share gain. With that, I'll give an update on our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2023.  I'm on Slide 11. I'll now provide some additional details regarding our revised 2023 guidance for both the second quarter and the full year. In Q2, we are projecting GAAP EPS to range from $1.86 to $1.89 and adjusted EPS to range from $2.10 to $2.13, with organic revenue growth of approximately 3% and adjusted EBITDA margins ranging from 27.3% to 27.7%. We anticipate that HST volumes will be negative in the second quarter, and the strength we saw in Q1 industrial performance sustains.  Turning to the full year. As Eric mentioned, we have reduced our full year revenue guidance, reflecting headwinds related to OEM destocking across the HST segment. At the midpoint, we expect volume and mix impact reduces EPS by $0.48, offset by $0.23 of cost actions, yielding $0.25 of net pressure on our annual guide. This equates to a full year low single-digit organic revenue contraction in HST and low- to mid-single-digit growth in FMT and FSD. Our view on the industrial market has not changed, and we continue to assume a second half decline with a modest recovery in the back half for HST.  Bringing it all together, we project GAAP EPS of $7.30 to $7.60 and adjusted EPS to range from $8.25 to $8.55. We expect full year organic revenue growth of 0% to 3% and adjusted EBITDA margin to range between 27.5% and 27.9%. The high end of our range implies that we will sustain our record profitability from last year. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be about $70 million, and free cash flow is expected to be 100-plus percent of adjusted net income. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Just starting with the HST story here. And look, we're seeing this across the sector. We covered Danaher. They've been through this, this whole kind of you're on the other side of the COVID surge in volume. And Dover's biopharma pumps, same story there as well. So it's not execution. We know that. It's not share loss. But what's your degree of confidence in the path to normalizing? Just what kind of visibility do you have here? Eric Ashleman : Well, thanks, Deane. I mean I'd say a couple of things. One, as you'd expect, given the magnitude of some of the swings, I mean, the discussions and the intensity and the iteration of them with end customers and at all levels, commercial operations is probably at the highest level we've ever had.  And then I would say, as you look at the actual order intake, you can see some things firming up in the back half. So you can see actually kind of the same planning and methods that are pulling it down now are actually repositioning it a little further out in the later -- in the year, sorry.  And you're seeing that for the kind of standard products that we would usually gauge, that are kind of right down the middle of the volume fairway. So that's -- it deviates a little bit market for market, but I'd say, those 2 factors are probably the 2 that we're most reliant on as we think about that. William Grogan : And I'd just add is our guide. On the low end, we have kind of that HST recovery only up about 1% sequentially from the first half to the second half. And then on the high side, a 7%. So reasonable range relative to the things that Eric just highlighted. Deane Dray : All right. That makes sense. I appreciate that. And then second question, and Eric, maybe you can bridge the comments from last quarter about uncertain period of softness, how that's being playing out here as well as the trends you're seeing across your short-cycle businesses, the implications, day rates, lead times and so forth. Eric Ashleman : So are you saying, Deane, kind of take it from a little bit more depth... Deane Dray : Yes. Eric Ashleman : On the HST and then rotate it over -- okay. Deane Dray : No, no, no. Just broadly for IDEX, your comment last quarter about uncertain period of softness. We're all seeing pockets of softness, but I wanted to see with a quarter through now, what trends you're seeing in the short cycle, is there... Eric Ashleman : Got it. Deane Dray : In lead times and so forth, thanks. Eric Ashleman : Yes. So obviously, the most pronounced recalibration happening exactly in the area that we're talking about here in HST. As you look at the industrial side of it and in particular, kind of the day rate stuff right down the center of our fairway, first quarter held up really, really well. I mean business to business, I think we called out ag is the only one where we saw some similar dynamics of kind of inventory and things ready to go to plan.  I will say though, in more recent data here in April, some of those canaries that we often reference, you can see things pull back a little bit, and you can see them doing it together. So it is going to be something we'll watch. April is, for whatever reasons, never a real strong predictor for us. It firms up as we go through May and especially into June. But I will say you can see a little bit of that there in those businesses. In terms of just day rates, it's not a big drop, but the uniformity of it is interesting across a couple of weeks here most recently.  And when you kind of hold that up with some other things, some of which we do informally and others have done more formally around inventory positions of distributors and things like that, maybe you can see sort of the same comments, hold that up with the same feelings of uncertainty. So it's not a logic break in terms of how this might play out.  And let's remember, in our comments here last time, I mean, we actually have this positioned in our back half. So we have a bit of a glide path and then here, very recently, seeing some of the first signs of it. Deane Dray : That's really helpful. Just to clarify, when you talk about the leading indicator canaries, that's like BAND-IT and Warren Rupp and Gast? Eric Ashleman : Yes. And a couple of the other FMT pump businesses and even more specifically, a couple of product lines we look at within and where we just know they tend to be ordered typically, 1 and 2 and 3, general replacement. The ones you mentioned, a few other places, but yes, they're the ones we often always look at when we talk to you. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Michael Halloran with Baird. Michael Halloran : Can we follow up on Deane's question and talk about the other side of the coin, just maybe the CapEx side of things? Are you seeing any pullbacks? Obviously ignore some of the destock HST stuff you already commented on. But on some of the other longer cycle pieces, are you seeing any change in dynamic? Or anything noteworthy underneath the hood? Eric Ashleman : Well, it's -- these are the larger projects that we sometimes talk about here. I mean we have them in 2 places, and they're a little different. So I think they're more pronounced, more aggressive on the HST side in the markets that we're referencing here. So you can see some concern in places like MPT. We referenced those in the comments. But let's tie those to that sort of general macro story that Deane did a good job framing for us. I think on the industrial side, I would just kind of come back and say, this -- the entirety of the cycle, it's not been a big piece of our story. I'll remind folks, in the beginning of the ramp-up post COVID, there was a lot of uncertainty there. Frankly, that turned into the inability to put those projects together, then as inflation came about, there was a repricing element that sort of prevented some of them from our side.  And now maybe we're drifting a bit more into uncertainty, too. So I'd argue it kind of held pretty [Technical Difficulty] quite positive for us, not really because of large projects, just that sort of general day-to-day business is doing real well. Michael Halloran : And apologies in advance for this one. I think Bill gave some commentary on expectations by the segments for the remainder of the year. Unfortunately, you guys were breaking up on me. Could you just repeat that in case I misheard? Or maybe I'm wrong, maybe you guys didn't do that, but can you comment on that? William Grogan : No, no. We did. In our updated guide, the implied organic revenue for HST is negative low single digits, and for FMT and FSD, positive low single digits. Michael Halloran : Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess just a quick follow-up on that then. On the FMT piece, the orders are good. I think the end markets there are probably a little bit healthier broadly. Why the decel as you work through the year on that piece specifically? Is there anything you're seeing that's concerning? Or is it just how you think things layer out as we look forward? William Grogan : No. Exactly. I mean, it's been our stance as we came into the year with an expectation that the industrials were going to start to fall off in the back half of the year. We saw strength in the first quarter. We knew what our backlog positions were. And Eric just highlighted some of the caution we're seeing in our daily book and ship order rates that I think just give us more confidence in our call that the back half will be softer for those businesses, down a couple of percent on the volume side as we progress over the next quarter or 2 -- post the second quarter, still positive there, yes. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Allison Poliniak : Keeping on FMT, can you touch on the acquisitions, KZValve and Nexsight, because it seems like they were exceptionally strong? Just want to better understand maybe the drivers there and sort of how we should think about those for the balance of the year. Eric Ashleman : Yes. I mean, holding up really, really well. KZ, just to remind people, brought a key piece of automation technology that, frankly, goes to the same customer set that we have in our Banjo business. They're very close by. So I mean this is a [Technical Difficulty]. And so we're working on the commercial side, the technical side and all of the pieces of the IDEX operating model. So really, really happy there.  The Nexsight business, reminder, there was -- they were kind of long channel partners, and there's a piece of software that came with that business we've long used as well. So many people have kind of associated this with IDEX for a number of years. So pretty seamless integration, expands our presence in depth. And then the water markets, as we referenced in the earlier comments and we'll say here, are doing well. There's good strong support for municipal projects, municipal work that I think will play out for quite a while. So yes, real favorable with those 2. William Grogan : Yes. And KZ, their mix of business is much more concentrated towards OEM. So they're not seeing some of the inventory issues that Banjo is. Eric Ashleman : Yes. Allison Poliniak : Got it. And then just on the HST side, again, I know you're looking for maybe that second half recovery from those inventory issues. But as we think about sort of that back half and then maybe even into '24, does that sort of drive that growth somewhat below trend of what you would expect kind of going forward at least over the next 12 months? Just any thoughts there. Eric Ashleman : I don't think so. I think largely, this is a story of coming off of a multi-period of really aggressive rates, both for us and our end customers. I mean I look at our segment. I mean HST was up 30% across 2 years. I think that tracks with a lot of the end markets where we are. And so a retraction or a pullback down to more typical rates in the single digits. Even if they're mid-single digits, it's pretty dramatic if, in fact, your thinking is changing in a relatively short time horizon.  So I think the single biggest variable for -- certainly for us as a component supplier into it is going to be levels of inventory [Technical Difficulty] taking it into different areas. So it's -- in some ways, it's doing math. It's math and rate of travel. It is different than we've seen before, but the preceding period in the run-up there was different as well. So I think we're all learning to do that together. And as I spoke earlier on the call, the need for even tighter alignment and iteration as we go through that to protect everybody is very important. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Nathan Jones : A couple of questions on HST. I was just wanted to hit the margins, down 300 basis points year-over-year in the first quarter. I think, Bill, you said -- you talked about lower absorption, but revenues were up 3% organically. Can you maybe just flesh out a little bit the inputs into the year-over-year margin decline in HST? William Grogan : Yes. I think the biggest driver, Nathan, is the mix impact. Some of the volume decreases we've seen are our highest margin product portfolio in the business that has somewhat offset that to keep the business positive from an organic perspective. And then with the overall segment being positive, there are still some pockets that were negative that caused us to deleverage on some of the fixed cost side. Nathan Jones : Okay. That makes sense. And then just maybe a little bit more color on how you expect the year to sequence on HST. I mean you had in the 20s of orders down. Just maybe any color you can give us on how we should think about the comps, I guess, especially in 2Q, with this being a relatively short-cycle business. Do you take most of the pain here on organic growth in the second quarter, and then you see revenues improve pretty meaningfully, sequentially as we go past that? William Grogan : No, no, relative to our backlog position. We will be negative in HST in the second quarter, but kind of low single digits. And then remember, the second half of this year is significant -- or the second half of last year was significantly higher. So we'll have a little bit of comp problems that will keep HST either flattish or slightly negative for the balance of the year. Nathan Jones : And then just one last one on HST. IDEX is not typically an inventory business. You end up typically seeing a lot of inventory on customer shelves. Obviously, an inventory destock is what we're talking about. And so can you just talk about how this inventory ends up on customer shelves, how that works its way through the system? Eric Ashleman : Yes. No, it's a great question, Nathan. I mean in general, everything we make here is pretty customized for a very specific end use, if not a specific single customer. And in the area that we're talking about in the health science world, I mean, that absolutely happens. These are spec-ed in components. They don't travel East and West. When we're more generally talking about an IDEX, though, FMT in that segment, FSD as well, you've got a channel between us and all of these fragmented end markets, which are at much lower volumes. And so no single one of them is going to tend to raise its head up at any one point. So that -- the comment generally holds there.  And while it's specific customized here, this is a highly concentrated customer set, and it's a super direct transaction. So if you chose to do it, and they don't often do it and this is a bit unprecedented, but if you chose to do it that way, you could put mission-critical components down that you know you're going to use because they're the most high-running parts that you have in the system, even though they are absolutely customized for that customer only. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Vlad Bystricky with Citigroup. Vladimir Bystricky : So I just wanted to ask you, in FMT, I think you, if I'm not mistaken, kind of upgraded your commentary around the strength of the energy and chemical performance you're seeing. I know you mentioned it's not really project activity. So can you just talk a little bit more about where you're seeing improvements in demand in those end markets, and how you're thinking about sort of the sustainability of that strengthening? Eric Ashleman : Yes. Well, I think in energy specific, remember that we largely do mobile custody transfer there. So there's a little bit of an overhang as the industry gets healthier and price support are out there. You're going to get some general tailwinds for CapEx spend. More specifically for us, though, we do a lot in mobile applications, a lot of which depends upon chassis availability.  That's been -- that was highly constrained for a couple of years. That's freed up as a lot of other supply chains have, and some of it is just captive demand at a good and favorable time in the environment, that -- something like that, a micro story like that actually matters for us. On the chemical side, we've seen strength in China, specifically, with our Richter business. I think some of that is probably also related to the fact the country was kind of locked down for a while. There are some investments that have to be made. We're super well positioned there. We'll see how that plays out longer term. And actually, Europe in the chemical side, which is an area of concern and was pretty depressed as well for a bunch of reasons we've talked about, that was actually pretty strong for us as well.  So it's these little pockets that kind of play out in typical IDEX fashion that goes from big to small stories here. But I would say, generally, we're still following others out there that are larger. So not a massive component of project spend or multi-period expansion here, but more micro events and things. And otherwise, markets, I think, are doing pretty well. William Grogan : And I think the other thing is on the Energy business, they've launched a couple of new products that have been very well received in the end marketplace. And then we talk about businesses that they had some differentiation relative to their ability to have inventory to supply their customer base. I think a couple of businesses within our valve that mostly sell into the chemical market have been well positioned relative to the inventory that they've carried to take some share from their customers. Vladimir Bystricky : Okay. That's really helpful. And then just on the M&A front, can you give us some more color on the Spectral tech acquisition? I know it's relatively small, but can you just talk about what attracted you to that particular asset, potential scalability of the business? And more broadly, what you're seeing in the M&A pipeline and environment today? Eric Ashleman : Yes, sure. So the -- I mean the Iridian business, I mean, it's -- as we said in the release, it's a leading designer and manufacturer of thin film, multilayer optical filters. We do that in a lot of other places within IDEX, both in our optical technologies segment and some of it embedded into the life sciences platforms as well.  So I think honestly, the size of this business is pretty typical for how we specialize technology of this type, it's kind of an ideal unit of measure, if you will. So think of it as a puzzle piece of technology that goes well with other pieces that we have. And honestly, the 3 primary segments here, we attack from a whole bunch of different places in IDEX, not all of them, just in optics and technology. So space broadband, super complementary to some other things we've talked about along the way in a great market.  The life sciences place side of it is probably intuitive. I mean we do other coatings here. Their technology is a little bit different. And so it fits in, in a way that we were -- we've been looking for, for a while. And then there's a telecom piece that's involved with 5G rollout and game filters and things like that. So it's the kind of work we know how to do. The other piece of this is their coding capacity then, when aligned with other pockets of coding capacity we have across IDEX, you can start to think of this as an aggregation and think of how you might move capacity around on what's now becoming quite a bit of mass and a very important job to do.  So it's a just really, really nice fit. We've known a lot of the folks associated with businesses like this for a number of years. So it's right in our universe, proprietary transactions. Super happy to have it here. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : I just wanted to come back to Nexsight and KZ. I think you responded to a prior question that they're strong. It's -- they look amazingly strong, right? I think an 11-point impact in FMT or acquisition impact in the quarter. Was there something unusual going on or some reclassification or something to drive that big of a result in those businesses? William Grogan : No. I mean the only thing of note, it was small, it was a couple of million dollars. Just as we got Nexsight on our normal accounting procedure, they picked up a couple of weeks of incremental revenue, but it was a $2 million, $3 million type of deal. Jeffrey Sprague : Okay. Great. I think I'll leave it there. My other questions were answered. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Eric Ashleman : Matt? Operator : Matt, your line is now live. William Jellison : This is Will Jellison on for Matt Summerville. I wanted to learn a little bit more about price and maybe start out with some historical context for how much price was realized in 2022 and how much incremental realization is expected across your businesses in 2023. Eric Ashleman : Yes, sure. So price is a big part of our value capture across our portfolio balancing, hey, we have differentiated products and making sure we capture that value from our customers. Obviously, last year, from an inflationary perspective, we were hitting an all-time high. So we had ramped our price pretty significantly as we went through, I think, topping off close to 5% last year.  This year, we guided about 4%. We're on track for that. That's a combination of new price increases that we've launched here throughout the first quarter and then carryover pricing from actions we took throughout last year. William Jellison : That's great. And then as a follow-up, I wanted to get an update on Muon. What is the expectation for organic growth in that business for 2023? And about how much adjusted EPS contribution is contributing to the guide for the year? William Grogan : Sure. I mean we haven't disclosed exactly other than it's at -- it will be at the high end of HST growth on a normalized basis. Before we bought them, they had been a double-digit compounder. So really successful with their growth trajectory historically, and we continue to see that here as they progress in the high single digits.  From an EPS perspective, I'd refer you to our annual guide. We didn't break out the individual pieces, but I think incrementally this year, we said $0.43 for Muon, the carryover for Nexsight and KZ, net of the divestiture of Knight. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Brett Linzey : I wanted to come back to HST. So the order's down 23%. Are you able to parse out how much of that decline was specific to the OEM destock versus maybe some softening in other areas of the portfolio? William Grogan : Brett, I apologize. Can you repeat that question? You broke up on us. Brett Linzey : Yes, sure. So the first one is on HST. So order's down 23%. Wondering if you're able to parse out how much of that decline was specific to the OEM destock versus softening in other areas of that business? William Grogan : [Technical Difficulty] million on the onetime order or the blanket that we received last year. So that was a couple of percent of the 23%. The balance is a lot of the market factors that Eric highlighted. Brett Linzey : Okay. Got it. And just one other one. You talked about some of the barometer businesses pulling back a little bit. How does that shape your thinking around incremental restructuring or further curtailment of some of this discretionary? Do you lean into additional actions here to defend the margins? Just curious what the business planning assumption is. Eric Ashleman : Yes. Look, I think so far, it's very in line with what we had played out in our -- for the year, the planning for it. So remember, we the softening in the back half on the industrial side. We're saying here, this might be some early indications that it will come to fruition. And so in those businesses, we've already made and lined up the discretionary cost reductions and some thought and care around any additions we might make in a way that's completely in line with what we had originally said. The targeted actions that we spoke about related to the HST destocking phenomenon, those are pretty targeted actions within those businesses. So this is where the -- if you will, the portfolio nature of IDEX really helps us. We can treat these in kind of a differentiated way and occasionally come together on just smart investments around travel and other discretionary things and just do it well as a team. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. Joseph Giordano : Sorry, I had muted myself. Can you guys hear me? William Grogan : Yes. Joseph Giordano : Okay. Cool. So Nathan had talked about this in his question, but I wanted to follow up there on the inventory thing in HST. Yes, you guys are not typically like components that are overstocked at OEM. So just -- was this a change in behavior like where OEM just acted differently because like unbeknownst to you where they were just buying in excess of their need for a long time, and maybe like maybe that level of granularity is not clear to IDEX? And so that's one.  And then you guys are generally a company that learns pretty quickly. So what do you do differently coming out of this? Or do discussions have to change? Or how do you kind of make sure that's something like this don't catch you off guard again? Eric Ashleman : Yes. No, it's a good question. I mean look, if you kind of get it right down to the way that inventory replenishment is done, obviously, your future projections and your assumptions around lead time drive almost all of your requirements. And so in hindsight, now you can view this and think, well, there must have been irrationality there, but I don't think that's actually the case. I think if you are projecting a line in a certain way, and you've been experiencing delivery patterns, not just for us, but for others at a certain level, it's going to say, you need a lot of stuff.  I think part of what's changed here and maybe changed most dramatically is you have kind of a simultaneous -- well, first of all, the calendar change, funny as it sounds, that always tends to bring a different headset. And I think there's some legitimate things out there kind of from a macro perspective that people are wondering about. We're further away from COVID. We're starting to see some pullback in biopharma spending. We have some funding crisis associated with start-ups and things in biopharma places.  So the minute you interject that back into the equation, you potentially go change your assumption on long-term demand, it actually has a pretty striking effect on what you should be bringing in. Now you combine that with the fact that we execute really well, so our lead times and our customer set, returning quickly back to normal, you put those 2 things together, even an automated system is going to say, \"Hey, you've probably got too much here.\"  So back to your point on learnings and things like that. First of all, we're not typically seeing cycles of this magnitude, these kind of swings. But to be fair, maybe in the world to come as we see, and it seems like there's always another chapter around the corner. So I do take your point. And I think higher iteration, really coming together and understanding long-term projections being maybe potentially more transparent with where we are in terms of lead time performance, customer set, making sure that, that's exactly understood not just today, but tomorrow as we move through cycles and swings like this, I think those would be the kind of things that our teams are talking about at both the commercial and the operational level. Joseph Giordano : No, that's fair. And then just last for me on the FMT side. I mean you talked about April weakening, and I know that your guidance assumes that industrials get worse in the back half of the year. But is the April weakening here kind of like in line in terms of magnitude with what you're contemplating at this point? Like nothing is -- if this was -- did you expect it to start now? Like how consistent is what you're seeing with what you previously thought? Eric Ashleman : Yes, I mean, I think this is about the pattern that you would expect at some point. I would say, look, this is pretty recent. April, as I said, is often a kind of an interesting month of transition as you move into the spring. So we'll see. But we're always looking for a slight step down one way or the other, and then uniformity. Because I think that's where, again, the portfolio nature of IDEX comes into play. We're able to kind of see it across a variety of end markets simultaneously, all of which have kind of the same sort of short order fulfillment patterns that have long been known to people.  So when they tend to move in concert with each other, either positively or negatively, it's at least worth looking at and taking a signal. I would say this is a small drop. It is uniform in nature, but that is exactly what we would have probably expected and I think is modeled in ultimately in the back end. And we'll obviously continue to monitor it and talk to you and others about it as we get -- roll through and finish the second quarter. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. And now I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing comments. Eric Ashleman : Thanks so much. I apologize, I know we've had some glitches with the technology. Maybe we'll need to put more filters to work on telecommunications.  First of all, I want to thank the IDEX employees. I know there's always some listening in on the call. Very, very strong quarter. You've continued to really perform for the business and for our customers. Thanks to others on the call for your interest and support in the company.  Bottom line here, we knew 2023 was going to be a year of recalibration moving from one state of the world to another. It's playing out more dynamically than we initially suspected in the HST side. But as you can see, we're executing through it. We're taking the appropriate responses in the business.  And I think most importantly, we ultimately believe in the long-term success and outgrowth in those markets. We're talking about coming down from highs to something that's actually pretty typical, but absolutely advantaged. We think it's going to continue that way and then accelerate for years to come.  So through all of these dynamic swings over the last 3 years, I'm really proud of the fact that we've executed well, and we certainly stepped up our capital deployment, really happy to announce the sixth transaction since the beginning of '21 with Iridian, doubled our emerging markets footprint and capability set and continue to strengthen a really unique culture as we've done it. So we're built for the long haul here. We're confident that we're going to perform and deliver value throughout. And I look forward to updating everybody along the way as the -- in the year to come and the years in the future play out for IDEX. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings and welcome to the IDEX Corporation Earnings Conference Call Second Quarter 2023. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answers session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Allison Lausas, Vice-President and Chief Accounting Officer. Thank you. You may begin. Allison Lausas : Good morning, everyone. This is Allison Lausas, Vice-President and Chief Accounting Officer for IDEX Corporation. Thank you for joining us for our discussion of the IDEX second-quarter 2023 financial highlights. Last night, we issued a press release outlining our company's financial and operating performance for the three months ending June 30, 2023. The press release, along with the presentation slides to be used during today's webcast can be accessed on our company website at idexcorp.com. Joining me today are Eric Ashleman, our Chief Executive Officer and President; and Bill Grogan, our Chief Financial Officer. Today, we will begin with Eric providing an overview of the state of IDEX's business. Then Bill will discuss second-quarter financial results, an update on segment performance in the markets they serve, and our outlook for the third-quarter and full-year 2023. Lastly, Eric will close the call with his final remarks. Following our prepared remarks we will open the call for your questions. If you should need to exit the call for any reason, you may access a complete replay beginning approximately two hours after the call concludes by dialing the toll-free number 877-660-6853 and entering conference ID number 13734463 or simply log on to our company's homepage for the webcast replay. Before we begin, a brief reminder, this call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the Safe Harbor language in last night's press release and in IDEX's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I will now turn this call over to our CEO and President, Eric Ashleman. Eric Ashleman : Thank you, Allison and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 6. IDEX delivered record sales and adjusted earnings per share in the second-quarter along with strong free-cash flow. Our Fluid and Metering and Fire and Safety diversified products businesses delivered exceptional performance on strong market fundamentals, both posting strong organic growth and profitability, with FMT delivering an all-time high EBITDA margin. Our Health and Science Technologies segment continue to face challenges impacted by inventory destocking in our analytical instrumentation, life sciences, biopharma and semiconductor markets. Our teams within the segment drove double-digit organic growth over the last two years, admirably executing for customers and the business in very difficult conditions. Now, on the backside of the post-pandemic recovery, our OEM partners are aggressively reducing higher inventory levels, beginning with those suppliers that have demonstrated the quickest returns to pre-pandemic lead times. Our teams are appropriately balanced as they execute targeted cost reductions to mitigate a portion of these volume declines, drive strong cash-flow overall, and continue to innovate for our customers. During our last earnings call, our revised outlook for the year assumed our industrial businesses would slow moderately in the second-half, while our HST segment would experience a modest rebound. While our view on the industrial markets has not changed, we are no longer projecting recovery in HST volumes in the second-half of the year. Our outlook is based on revised forecasts from our key customers who are reevaluating their end-market demand alongside their current inventory levels. They're considering many factors overall, including supply-chain improvements, lower-than-expected growth in China, and overall macro pressures within their market verticals. This is a complex and rapidly evolving context, which played out for us in Q2 with a 27% year-over-year organic drop in HST orders. This moderating demand profile, net of our incremental cost containment actions drives an additional $0.45 of EPS pressure at the midpoint versus our previous guide. With that, as we noted in our press release, we are revising our full-year 2023 adjusted EPS guidance to $7.90 to $8 per share. Bill will discuss the specifics in greater detail during our segment and guidance updates. In the second-quarter, we also closed on the Iridian Spectral Technologies deal we announced earlier this year, adding another market leader in custom optical filter solutions serving the space, life science and telecommunications markets. We continue to focus on driving strong operational performance regardless of business environment, delivering and innovating for our customers. We're driving speed and agility within our businesses taking out inventory and driving world-class lead times, positioning us best for growth cycles to come. We remain committed to managing through the short-term while not losing focus on critical investments in the development of our people, in capital deployment and in our differentiated technologies to enable our long-term growth path and deliver above market performance over the cycle. With that, I will turn it over to Bill to discuss our financial results. William Grogan : Thanks, Eric. Moving on to our second-quarter consolidated financial results on slide eight. All comparisons are against the second-quarter of 2022, unless otherwise stated. Orders of $766 million were down 9% overall, and down 13% organically, mainly driven by a 27% organic decrease in HST, due to timing of project orders for next-gen sequencing equipment, as well as OEM pressure across the life sciences, analytical, instrumentation, pharma and semiconductor markets. Record sales of $846 million were up 6% overall and up 3% organically. We experienced 10% organic growth within FMT, 8% organic growth within FSD and 6% organic decrease in HST. Gross margin of 44.7% decreased by 10 basis points compared with last year. This was driven by lower-volume leverage in HST, the dilutive impact of acquisitions and unfavorable mix. Partially offset by strong price-cost and favorable operational productivity across the segments. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.4%, up 90 basis points. I will discuss the drivers of adjusted EBITDA on the next slide. Our second-quarter effective tax rate was 22.4% was comparable with our prior year effective tax rate of 22.1%. Net income was $139 million, which resulted in an EPS of $1.82. Adjusted net income was $165 million with an adjusted EPS of $2.18, which was up $0.16 or 8%. Finally, cash from operations of $141 million was up 26%, primarily due to lower investments in working capital versus last year. Free cash flow for the quarter included higher CapEx and was $120 million, up 24% versus last year, coming in at 72% of adjusted net income. We drove over $20 million of inventory out of the business in the quarter through our targeted reduction efforts. And we saw inventory returns improve versus last quarter. Moving on to Slide 9, which details the drivers of our second quarter adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $22 million compared to the second quarter of 2022. Our 3% organic growth included over 4% of price, placing volumes negative for the quarter. This lower volume unfavorably impacted adjusted EBITDA by $9 million flowing through at our prior year adjusted gross margin rate. Price cost was accretive to margins, and we drove operational productivity that offset employee related inflation. The mix was unfavorable by $3 million, mainly centered in HST due to continued volume declines in our analytical instrumentation and life science components. Resource and discretionary spending was approximately flat versus last year. We have executed tight cost controls given our volume pressure, and we continue to identify reduction opportunities for the balance of the year. Reductions and variable compensation expense based on our updated outlook contributed $5 million of benefit in the quarter. These results yielded a 60% organic flow-through. Muon and KZValve acquisitions, net of the Knight divestiture and FX contributed an additional $9 million of adjusted EBITDA. Inclusive of acquisitions, divestitures and FX, we delivered 43% flow-through. Excluding the impact of variable compensation, flow-through is about 35%. With that, I'll provide a deeper look at our segment performance. In our fluid metering technology segment, we experienced strong sales performance with organic growth of 10%. But orders did contract by 4% organically, mainly driven by the slowing industrial landscape. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 340 basis points versus the second quarter of last year, driven by strong price cost performance and volume leverage. We saw our industrial day rate decline early in the second quarter remained steady at that lower level. Customers are taking a cautious view of the second half as they process a variety of economic factors that influence their demand. Our water business performed well. The North American market continues to be positive with extreme weather, necessary technology and infrastructure upgrades and improved funding, all fueling growth. Our energy markets remain mixed. Improved chassis availability is driving strength in our mobile applications and the teams continue to work down past due backlog, but lower oil prices look to slow the pace of investment in the second half of the year. In the chemical market, we saw positive results across the US, Europe and Asia, with battery markets providing additional opportunities for growth. The agricultural demand landscape remains mixed. Farm fundamentals are positive overall, and our OEM business remains strong. However, distributor inventory levels remain high, and we have not seen a material bleed down as we have progressed through the planting season. Moving to the Health & Science Technologies segment. Organic orders contracted 27% in the quarter, driven by analytical instrumentation, life science and biopharma customers' inventory destocking, timing of next-gen sequencing orders, soft semiconductor and slowing industrial demand. Sales were down 6% organically and adjusted EBITDA margins contracted by 420 basis points driven by unfavorable volume leverage and mix as well as higher employee-related costs, partially offset by strong price cost performance. As Eric noted, our Life Science and Analytical Instrumentation businesses are being impacted by customers' inventory destocking and reduced demand. This was driven by a combination of improved supply chain conditions, macroeconomic factors and lower-than-expected China demand. We expect this pressure to remain throughout the balance of the year. The semiconductor market continues to experience softness resulting from memory oversupply, as well as customers feeling the impact of the US export controls. We have exposure to multiple parts of the semiconductor value chain and expect demand will stabilize in the third quarter with recovery in the fourth quarter. Our Material Processing Technology business continues to experience softness across pharma, biopharma and nutrition markets, driven by tighter capital availability and customer hesitancy due to recession concerns. We are seeing some strength in aftermarket and positive impact from our battery market opportunities and we see some signs of improved quotation activity for these early days. Industrial markets and HST slowed in the quarter in line with FMT results. Finally, turning to our Fire & Safety Diversified Products segment. Organic orders grew by 2% versus last year, mainly driven by favorable fire and safety, and dispensing results. Organic sales growth was strong at 8% with double-digit growth in both Fire & Rescue and BAND-IT. Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by 300 basis points versus last year, largely driven by strong price cost performance, operational productivity, favorable volume leverage, and positive mix. The paint market remains mixed with positive North American results, offset by delays of Europe and Asia customer investments. Within our fire business, we continue to gain share with North America mid-tier and China OEMs through our integrated system strategy. Underlying truck demand remains positive and OEMs continue to improve their output. Rescue markets are stable overall with some distributors burning off excess inventory being balanced by growth in our E3 products. BAND-IT results remain positive. We continue to gain share in an otherwise flat automotive market, which is partially offset by slowing energy and industrial markets. With that, I'll provide an update for our outlook for the third quarter and the full year 2023. I'm on Slide 11. In the third quarter, we are projecting GAAP EPS to range from $1.60 to $1.65 and adjusted EPS to range from $1.84 to $1.89. Organic revenue is expected to decline 7% to 8%, and adjusted EBITDA margins are estimated to be approximately 27%. We project sequential volume declines across HST and FMT with relatively flat FSD sales. On a year-over-year basis, we expect negative mid-teen organic sales decline in HST, negative low to mid-single-digit declines in FMT and low single-digit growth in FSD. Turning to the full year. As Eric mentioned, we have reduced our full year revenue guidance in response to our softening HST second half outlook. We now expect organic revenue declines of 1% to 2%. This implies high single-digit revenue contraction in HST with low to mid-single-digit growth in FMT and FSD. At the midpoint, we have reduced our EPS guidance by $0.45 with approximately $0.60 related to lower volume and the associated leverage and unfavorable mix. We offset $0.15 of this pressure with additional cost containment actions related to targeted restructuring and lower resource investment, and variable compensation along with discretionary spend. In summary, we estimate full year organic revenue contraction of 1% to 2%, GAAP EPS of $6.80 to $6.90 and adjusted EPS of $7.90 to $8. Adjusted EBITDA margin will be approximately 27%. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be about $70 million and free cash flow is expected to be 100-plus percent of adjusted net income. With that, I'll turn it back over to Eric for his closing remarks. Eric Ashleman : Thanks, Bill. I'm on Slide 12. As we've said in the past, our IDEX leadership will not allow short-term economic fluctuations to alter our foundational objectives, delivering strong execution for our customers, building great global teams and deploying our capital with discipline. We've always invested in our best growth opportunities across our well-positioned diverse franchises. Over the last 10 years, we leveraged 80/20 to optimize business performance and fine-tune our portfolio towards faster-growing application sets. We're now adding power and next level potential to our best advantage businesses and platforms through thoughtful and aggressive capital deployment. Our Muon business, acquired last year, supports the most difficult applications within high-quality semicon, just like our businesses in Sealing Solutions and Optical Technologies. Those optics businesses also play a critical role within space broadband markets, now complemented by our most recent acquisition of Iridian Spectral Technologies. Our acquisition of KZValve opens the door for our Banjo franchise to play even deeper within fluidic handling for precision agriculture solutions. Our Nexsight business brings more software intelligence and channel assets into the water platform. Airtech opens doors within alternate energy gensets. ABEL Pumps helps customers mine deeper to find the minerals required to power the e-mobility revolution. The reality is that, IDEX products are everywhere playing close to the core of the world's most advanced technologies. Our components orientation allows for maximum tunability and flexibility to pivot resources to the fastest-growing mega trends. None of this is possible without talented people and teams who thrive in an outstanding entrepreneurial culture. This aspect is a source of competitive advantage for IDEX. We knew this was going to be a year of transition and dynamic recalibration with a course that would be hard to predict. We're managing the near term urgently and appropriately, but with an enthusiasm that recognizes the potential for great things ahead. With that, I'd like to turn it over to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mike Halloran with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed. Michael Halloran : Hi, good morning, everyone. Eric Ashleman : Hi, Mike. Michael Halloran : So, a couple of questions. First, let's talk about the -- obviously, the biggest piece in the quarter, the analytical instrumentation, life science, biopharma, et cetera, pressure points. And not overly surprising given what your customers are saying publicly as well. Maybe talk about a couple of things here, how you look at this bottoming curve? When you think we can get back to maybe a little bit more normalized environment in the context of some of the funding, the oversupply, over investment, et cetera? I know you don't feel any differently about the long-term growth curve, but would love to get a sense for internally how you guys are thinking about the recovery curve? Eric Ashleman : Yes. Well, thanks for that. So, I think if we step-back and kind of think about this traversing over the course of the year. I go back to kind of the end of Q4, that's where we went some virtually unbounded demand essentially only capacity and capability, entering the mix is a constraint. To those first signs that, okay, we're going to have to tune this thing and get it to something more sustainable long-term, more normal. So we saw that play-out initially as a lot of focus on inventory, just too much inventory all over the place. I think over-time and here especially in the second-quarter, we saw a view of -- as people start to attack that with analytics and we got a lot closer to our customers. You could see kind of the depth of it; where it was accumulated, how much it was -- how long it was going to take to burn that off, that became kind of a secondary component for us in Q2. And then I think -- I think the piece that's really played out and we saw a lot of this calibration in the second-quarter was another assessment of end-markets and where they really are on the customer's part. So, you kind of had markets clicking along kind of at the top-end of high-single-digits, I think in the pandemic, kind of moved back-down to an assumption that they would be more normal, I'd say, more mid-single digits. And I think closer now to -- in the near-term at least, balance of the year, in that low single digits, with those factors that I talked about in the open remarks. And I think probably maybe strength of China being the one that was the most pronounced and started to really pop out of the page for -- and the conversations that we had in Q2. So we sort of backed-up, took a look at those forecast, that situation, and as you can see here, essentially, cleared the deck for the rest of the year. I think we've bottomed-out from an orders perspective. We've seen kind of the levels that we're at now hold here through July. Even with all the analytics, today we have an inventory, you can see the two kind of working together. So, then I think that all of the visibility shifts to probably the real spirit of your question, which is, when does this start to get back to something that's more traditional in terms of growth rates. For us, I think, honestly, we see that past -- certainly, past the six months that are ahead of us, somewhere probably out in 2024, obviously the comparatives would get a lot easier. But I think we're still going to all have to watch. We're going to have to watch and see what's the long-term call on China. Is this a trough of a cycle there and there is ultimately an uptick? We'll be listening for that intelligence as well. The funding environment, how are people leaning into kind of approving projects and outfitting plants and things that we see in the CapEx intensive sides of our business, probably the semicon piece, that I feel the best about. I mean, that's tracked by everybody and we can kind of see -- everybody pointing to better days ahead starting in kind of -- for us, probably beginning of Q4 and certainly leading into the year. So I think the arrow up in 2024, probably still with some variable rates coming out of it and a lot more assessments that we've got to make as we go through a period that we think now it's been derisked and sort of laid out there in a way that we can all get comfortable with. Michael Halloran : Great. No, that's super helpful. And maybe the exact same conversation on the short-cycle industrial pieces, the weakening side of things. Obviously, Bill, in the prepared remarks gave a lot of context on where some of that softening is. I just would like to understand how you think that bottoms out and how that recovery curve plays out in the context of -- clearly a lot of moving pieces out there? Eric Ashleman : Yes. And I want to emphasize that, that side of the businesses it's kind of run its course exactly the way we thought it would. So you've seen here, order rates declining, that's the normalization of backlog. I want to make it clear to everybody that you all recognize how close to normal we actually are now. So our backlog, when you net out sort of the compounded price, the aggressive price that's happened over the last couple of years and compare it to sort of pre-pandemic levels. We're basically pretty close. We're a little higher-than-normal, but we'll get there soon, certainly in the back-half of the year. So that's on the industrial side of the business. Our quarterly coverage that we have, if you're familiar with us, we typically talk about half the quarter covered, and the other half we have to go find. We're there now. And so, really now we are able to see into these markets and understand and think a lot more about the future than the past. And that's why as we kind of got -- re-examined the list of markets that don't went through. And you're seeing, I think in many ways kind of an absence of catalysts unless it's really, really tied to identifiable mega trend with a bunch of funding sources, like the water space for us. You're seeing kind of that same story of, hey, hesitancy. I wonder where things are going. A little reticence to go ask for big funding of large capital projects. So, I think we're well-positioned for what inevitably at some point will start to move-up, and I do believe that next cycle is going to be a good one. But I think here in the near-term it's still going to be kind of a story of watching the rest of the world catch-up and kind of get to the same point of calibration that we are. And then, I think it's going to be a much bigger, broader kind of macroeconomic conversation as we head into 2024, of which catalysts will be out there. The good news from an IDEX perspective is, I know you know, Mike, we do really well on the entry point, once we kind of hit this point and are ready to go, short lead times, rapid recovery out there at the tip of the spear with innovation. So, that's kind of my take on where things are now with an emphasis on how close to normal the company is actually positioned. Michael Halloran : That's great. If I could just squeeze one more in. You mentioned that, confident in the cycle, you added Slide 12, where you're talking about how well you're positioned for growth. Could you just give some context of what you think that growth algorithm looks like for you? What are we talking about in terms of what the sustainable organic growth profile looks, or the relative outperformance you can get versus whatever the markets are doing, maybe put that in context on a longer horizon for us? Eric Ashleman : Yes. I think the examples I cited there, particularly now that they've been augmented with some really, really strong capital deployment. It gets us closer to that 300% outperformance that we've been shooting for in terms of potential of delivery. So if, let's say, we enter a world that has kind of a 2% nominal floor, we would be expecting to drive with combination of solid price capture, innovation, and the assets that we have, something closer to that 5% level. And then, continuing to deploy capital on top of that, which then ultimately if you kind of run it through the algorithm of contribution margins and the compounding nature of what we have as a company, that sets up the double-digits earning growth that I think everybody kind of expects and is looking-forward to from an IDEX. Michael Halloran : Thanks. Really appreciate it, Eric. Eric Ashleman : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets, please proceed. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Eric Ashleman : Good morning, Deane. Deane Dray : I want to follow-up on some of the commentaries, both on the HST and industrial side. And on HST, we agree, this has been well vetted in terms of the public company analytical instrument, companies discuss, saying the destocking, and we're getting the sense that the bottoming is coming, but just share with us, you're one-step removed as a supplier to these OE's. So what is your level of visibility and how has that changed? And what has happened with lead times now that you've had -- much of this destocking happening? Eric Ashleman : Yes. Well, you're absolutely right. I mean, it's important that people understand that the typical IDEX solution here is a component, which is going into some system or device that thins out there, it goes out into the market. And then there's a whole bunch of other revenue streams that come with it, service and consumables and things -- we don't participate there. And so, we're talking primarily with people in factories and supplying and purchasing change, obviously engineering on the innovation side, but typically not the first-person that they're going to talk to you on a commercial conversation about kind of where they're seeing. So that's always been a little harder for us. It's a conversation to have. And so, you can kind of think of the way this has played out as we have kind of crawled up from the factory floor into front and center commercial conversations, mainly because of our criticality. We're in a place -- we get there where others probably don't, because of the essence of what we're making and what it does for the end device. So, I will absolutely tell you that one of the benefits of what we've come through here is we have a lot deeper relationships, we're in different conversations than we've been able to be into, and our understanding of kind of inventory positions and philosophy, it's better now than it's ever been before, because it has to be. Your second question then was related to lead times. I mean, we are in really, really in good shape and that in some ways is why you're seeing and have seen kind of the rapid degradation of order rates. When -- we did the same thing. We're thinking about taking inventory out of the system, we essentially do 80/20. You lineup dollars of supply and your secondary factor is always assurance supply, OTD and capability. When those two things come together, you essentially hammer the orderbook. So in many ways we've seen that play out probably the most aggressive, given who we are and what we do. And it's an indication of where we are from a lead-time. Our ultimate backlog position for the company, quarterly coverage of order rates is also a validation of where we are, because it's right back to very, very typical levels for us. Deane Dray : All right. That's really helpful. And just to flip over on the industrial side, what we're trying to do is connect the dots here about your commentary about slowing industrial orders and slowing industrial landscape and I'm trying to parse out how much of this is just a result of the normalizing supply-chain and release of buffer inventories and shortening lead times, which in itself is kind of a normalized process. But it doesn't sound like there's anything disturbing on the end-market, the sell-through side of the end-market demand, but I just wanted to get clarification on that. So how much of this is strictly from a normalizing supply-chain on the industrial side versus any deterioration on the end-market demand? Eric Ashleman : Yes. I think you're thinking about it right. I mean the predominant driver here is the normalization of the cycle. Absolutely. It's just -- I said this -- I don't know, in these calls or the last couple of times that eventually you run into physics. There's no need to keep all this backlog around unless you're going to alter permanently the capability of the system, and nobody wants to do that. So a lot of this is playing out. If you look at our last quarter here, particularly on the industrial side, we posted double-digit organic growth, it's not necessarily indicative of the environment that's out there. That's us eating the last of the backlog in the past-due and getting our own lead times where we want to get to. As we are doing that, it's telegraphed through to the customer who is then dropping their order rates exactly the way you'd expect that they would. Underneath all of that, this allows us to, as I said before, really see, okay, what is this environment that's out in front of us, both today and tomorrow. And you're right. I don't see a lot of things in there that are overly negative. In fact, I see kind of a lot of the same behavior that we saw before this. In many ways, still some continued reluctance to make big capital purchase bets and all of those things. But to be honest, those really weren't here over the last couple of years either. So there's not a lot of negative noise that's behind that recalibration curve that's happening there. I would also say, though, there isn't a lot of tons of super positive things there as well, where people are saying, \"Well, now that this is behind us, we're ready to go on Project A, B and C.\" But I don't know that, that's actually different from where we've been. So I don't know. I hope that's helpful, but I think your opening statement is pretty close here that the major driver is a cycle playing out and that fundamentally underneath it, there's not a ton of noise in terms of what's going on market to market. Deane Dray : Alright. Eric, that's exactly what we're looking for, and appreciate all the color. Thank you. Eric Ashleman : Thanks Deane. Operator : Our next question comes from Alison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Allison Poliniak : Hey, good morning. Just on the HST, thanks for the color on how to think of organic decline in Q3. On the EBITDA margin, obviously down year-over-year this quarter, does that take another step down? Or are you stemming through the decrementals now, just given the aggressive approach to cost, just any color on how we should think of that just given the sharp decline in organic next quarter? William Grogan : Yes, Allison, it's Bill. I think in the third quarter, you'll see a little bit of additional pressure as volume steps down in the third quarter. And we bottomed out in the orders side here in Q2. Sales will bottom out in Q3. I think margins hit its low point, and we'll start to build back up Obviously, the additional cost actions we have taken have helped mitigate that. And then the volume leverage we'll get as we start to build back in the fourth quarter. We'll start to set our journey back to a 29%, 30% EBITDA-type margin as we progress through the recovery. Allison Poliniak : And then just in terms of the dislocation here in the analytical instrumentation market, is that driving any incremental sort of M&A opportunities, just given the unusual nature of it or kind of steady as it's been? Just any color there. William Grogan : Yes. No, not really. I mean, I haven't seen anything there. I mean the backdrop matters. It might prevent some folks from putting something out there because they want to let things clear and not be quite as noisy or something like that in the short term, but nothing that's really topped and said because the cycle is playing out a certain way, the funnel is now composed much different than it has been for us. Allison Poliniak : Got it. And then just one last quick one. The inventory drawdown on your side. Bill, did you say you guys were largely done with that? Or is there still more to go in the second half year? William Grogan : No, there's still more to go. I think from absolute dollars, I think we'll continue to bleed. Inventory turns, there will be a little bit pressure just with the decreased volumes within HST, but the teams continue to track, and there's probably another $20 million to $30 million of inventory reduction here in the back half. Allison Poliniak : Perfect. Thank you. William Grogan : Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from Vlad Bystricky with Citigroup. Vlad Bystricky : Good morning, team. Thanks for taking the call. So I just wanted to ask within FSDP, a couple of things there. In terms of the durability of the strength you're seeing at Fire & Rescue, are you able to parse out sort of how much of that is better chassis availability with your traditional OEMs versus your growing relationships with the mid-tier OEMs and the retrofit offerings you now have available. Eric Ashleman : I don't know that, that particular fine-tuning is a big driver here. I would say the chassis availability and that the improving nature of it is a positive catalyst for that business, and it's something we knew when we saw that backlog extend for, frankly, a long period of time that as it would start to expand itself, we knew that would be pretty gradual but ultimately positive for us for business. The composition of who they are in terms of suppliers inside it, it's interesting around the margins, but I would say it's going to be -- put it in the category of generally positive and probably positive for all. Vlad Bystricky : Got it, okay, that's helpful and then just a follow-up within that segment. The strength in the North American paint dispenser business, I think it was a little surprising versus what I was expecting anyway. So were there any larger onetime type deliveries in there that contributed to that strength? And how are you thinking about the outlook for the NAM dispenser business going forward? Eric Ashleman : No. I think dispensing had a couple large project orders that they're delivering on here as they progressed in the second quarter and within the third quarter. Then I think as we passed the end of the year, the North American replenishment cycle will be, for the most part, over. And then we look for some of the opportunities to continue on the emerging market side. Europe was a little bit slower for us this year and see if there's a bit of a recovery going into next year to help offset that. But that business will start to decline, especially on the orders as we progress through the back half of the year. Vlad Bystricky : Okay, great, that's helpful, thanks a lot, get back-in queue. Eric Ashleman : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. Joe Giordano : Hey, good morning guys. Eric, I just kind of wanted to square your commentary about like a lack of catalysts in a lot of the markets is interesting. And how do you kind of -- juxtapose with confidence around and optimism around chip stack and infrastructure bill and manufacturing, non-risk spending kind of like very high levels right here. How do you kind of square all that stuff? Eric Ashleman : Well, look, I think those are all absolutely legitimate of the things we're planning on. It's what we're tuning the company to be. I'm, in some ways, helping people understand what I'm describing, we're at a position now where we can kind of see exactly the mindset of people in the current -- in the next quarter in a way that for years, we have not been able to. And so I'm with you because I think many of the kind of big broader trends that are out there are going to have nice runs as we go forward. Some of them are underway now. Some are going to be in the next period to come. But I do think there's some noise in the system where, again, people are processing a lot of their own backlog and things like that. And then it's easier to sort of link that to those trends and say, well, there it is. That's validation. I just -- this is a unique point that it's taken us a few years to get to that says, no, no, everything we see now is actually near term or talking about the world that's right in front of us. So -- and again, some of those things are playing out. We had that in the walk. We talked about water. We talked about some decent things happening in chemicals. We just talked about some of the chassis Eric Ashleman : Availability in this building. So I don't want to diminish those in any way. But in some ways, I'm just trying to show that we've really got solid visibility here. We'll be able to see them as they inevitably start to play in and layer in at different points along the curve as we go forward. Joe Giordano : Yes, I think that's fair. And would you just -- would you categorize -- it seems like most companies this quarter are kind of like -- are certainly changing their commentary around like industrial distribution and things like that. It seems to be weakening and orders are getting worse. And you guys -- maybe you feel like you were just kind of there first, and this is... Eric Ashleman : I will be in a category now. I think actually, we're in sync with distribution. We're out there with them. We're looking for new opportunities, and we already live that. We were seeing that when others weren't talking about it, which is always the frustrating part of the beginning of one of these curves for us. So I knew this year was going to have this element. It puts us to the back side of it, which then says, I think you'll see that we'll be talking about other things, other catalysts in a solid way that maybe it's going to take some time for others to kind of walk into, but that is a perfect example. Joe Giordano : Fair enough. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Nathan Jones : Good morning, everyone. Eric Ashleman : Hey Nathan. Nathan Jones : I wanted to start with just taking a finer point on some of the inventory correction. Can you quantify what you think the headwind to growth or the dollars of inventory that are coming out of the business, or coming out of your customers' businesses this year, that will obviously, if we get that destock complete this year won't repeat next year. Eric Ashleman : No. Nat, let me take a crack at that. I think that's a reasonable amount of the current volume declines as the folks have calibrated on their months of supply pulling down. So that was really our expectation in the first quarter. As they look at their end market demand and then their inventory position had a second-tier bleed down again here in the second quarter with, I think where our order patterns and our volumes are for the balance of the year, that's holistically through. And then any volume shifts are really going to be reflective of true end market demand, really what Eric talked about is us being in sync relative to our lead times with where they've calibrated around new expectations of their volumes. So it's a reasonable portion of the pressure we've experienced so far this year. Nathan Jones : Okay, then I'm going to ask a question on a metric that I don't think anybody out there has really talked about for the last 3 years, which is on-time delivery, because with all the supply chain challenges, everybody's on-time delivery metrics got blown up. Now that you're talking about lead times being kind of fairly back to normal, how much improvement have you seen in on-time delivery metrics? Where are they relative to where they were before COVID? And how much more improvement is left to go on that? Eric Ashleman : Yes. So I mean that is a great question. Our on-time delivery is in really, really good shape. I mean, so think of this in the 90% plus. That's where we need to be. A huge piece of that, when you think about it, is that's measured against lead time expectations that customers have. So one of the things that's really changed here in the last couple of years is people have potentially put orders into one or two buckets, either as soon as you can do it, please, which really is there's no yardstick or they've taken the queue from businesses like ours to say, well, what's your current capability, okay, put it in my order for that level. What's important is you start to get better, you have to communicate it to your customers so they understand it. That's kind of one of the first things that we teach within our own operating model, make sure people know where we are. So that, frankly, they understand that they can start to dial that into their own requirements, we can plan a better factory that way. And so you're actually -- the improvement that I'm citing is against a moving bar that moves closer with lower lead times. So that's a really, really interesting point that we're always on the lookout for to make sure that we've kind of moved out of that world of promises to actual customer requirements. And that our lead times are in sync with those, and then the ultimate metric says prove it with the OTD number. And so we're in really, really good shape. William Grogan : That's a really-really interesting point that we're always-on the lookout for to make sure that we kind of moved out of that world of promises to actual customer requirements and that our lead times are in sync with those and then the ultimate metrics says prove it with the OTD number. And so we're in a really-really good shape and I think for a couple of businesses where we're still struggling with. Extended lead times or on-time delivery. Those are the business is actually orders have still been fairly positive, because those behaviors, haven't been able to calibrate on their customers exact to the point Eric highlighted earlier, where we have seen all those improvements, you've seen new order rates comprised are aligned with shorter lead times. Nathan Jones : And just one last one on the cost actions that you're taking here. I understand you guys plan for the long term here and that you're probably not going to cut too deep given that this might be a short sharp correction markets could recover next year. Can you talk about the type of costs that you're taking out and the target costs that you're not taking out? William Grogan : Yes. I mean the first phase of cost reduction is obviously on the discretionary side, things that we've implemented broad-based across the portfolio. We talked about that last quarter, even in the businesses that weren't as impacted as [indiscernible]. They helped to mitigate some of the profit shortfalls. And the second phase has been volume-related costs. We've done a little bit of restructuring internally. That's saved some of the economics. But to your last point, fundamentally, we're leveraging 80/20 and a resource allocation model to preserve a vast majority of our growth resources, as Eric's point, I think we are going to be through this phase at some point in time next year. The investments that we're making now will drive results into the future. Eric Ashleman : And Nathan, this is -- Bill mentioned it, but this is where 80/20 really helps us as a company. And essentially, if you think of it in its simplest form, it says, take your existing people that already work here and know the company and leveraging them as powerfully as possible, so you don't have to hire incremental head count at a time that you're pressured. And we use 80/20 to guide that. So just make sure you're at a point with maximum power and impact and you'd be surprised how much work people can do. And then you kind of get through this and that maintains the base. Nathan Jones : Great, thanks very much for taking my questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is from Robert Wertheimer from Melius Research. Robert Wertheimer : Thanks, good morning, everybody. You've touched on this throughout the call, and I think you've been pretty clear, but if the issue is trying to figure out how channel inventory dynamics and HST relate to the rest of the business or whether there's a risk of that happening. I wonder if you could step back a little bit and talk about how the channel in HST differs from the other 2 segments? And then I assume the analytic process that you put in the kind of focus in your comments on HST is applied broadly throughout the business. So I wonder if you can just sort of help with that understanding and that risk of the channel destock. Eric Ashleman : That was a great question that important that people understand. So everything we talked about generally in those HST markets with a massive change, those are direct relationships. So -- and they're some of the most concentrated customer sets we have. So not a lot of names, and we're very directly linked to them. So your first point where it's very different is when you go over into kind of the FMT world and even the industrial side of HST, those are typically distribution environments. Not a lot of stocking that happens there. But think of it, the more important element is there's just a lot of people. So numerous markets, lots of positions, lots of partners, and so it's just fragmented. And you just got a natural buffer there against any real swing either on the way up or the way down, you just don't typically see it that dramatically, and you've got optionality. I mean some people out there will choose to carry more inventory through all of this. They're going to make differentiated calls. But that concentrated OEM set does tend to move like a pack. And here, we've seen it move the most aggressively. Your last point was on analytics. We've always had great distribution analytics. It's a participated model. It's not this kind of stocking model where there's a curtain between us and the end markets. We're partners in this. We've known each other for a long time, and we actually need to participate in the cells. So because of that, we've got -- we've long had good analytics on inventory positions, who we're selling it to, how they're thinking about things. So that's been a staple. I'd say that the move forward to something more positive I referenced earlier, was getting even closer to the nuts and bolts of those OEM relationships where we have that direct line of sight. Robert Wertheimer : Perfect. That was educational. And just because I don't know, and I'm not sure you say, but what is the China mix within HST. And is that weakness in China, obviously, China is weak. I don't know if that's general economic slowdown or something industry-specific that accentuated it for you there. Eric Ashleman : Well, it really doesn't ping for us is a China sale because we're typically selling to the North American partners or something like that. We're reading through their commentary about end placement of instruments and things. Robert Wertheimer : Perfect, okay. I'll stop there. Thank you. Eric Ashleman : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions in queue at this time. I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Ashleman for closing comments. Eric Ashleman : Thank you very much. Thanks for everybody joining today. Just a couple of summary takeaways here. I mean we said from the beginning, this was going to be a year of aggressive recalibration. That's certainly proven out. But I think this is truly the final economic phase of this pandemic. It's going to play itself out here through the balance of the year and will be done with it. And for us, that means, look, our backlog is almost back to normal. It will be here soon. Our quarterly order coverage is normal now. I don't think we've got a lot of abnormal pandemic-induced order trends that we're going to be processing and talking about, and I could not be looking more forward to that, I assure you. And then really, I'll just go back to kind of what I talked about on that last slide in the intro here. The future is going to be really, really good. We will accelerate quicker than others is whatever the next cycle is, plays out positively for us. We'll see that. We're good diagnostic there. And because of the strength and resiliency we built over the last couple of years here, we're going to perform very, very well when that happens. All of the things we talked about in terms of capital where we've deployed it, the work we've done intensively around strategy, it's going to take us up another 100 basis points in that outperformance, and I referenced that earlier, too, as we're thinking about outgrowing our core markets. And just last, I know a lot of our team members listen in on these calls. I really want to thank them for just solid, solid execution through all of it, in particular, our teams in HST. You might imagine to kind of go from as fast as you can go to slowing down in the amount of time -- the short duration there, that has been really challenging for them. And they have absolutely stood up in the way that we know IDEX employees do all over the place. So thanks for that. Have a great day. We'll talk to you soon. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a great day.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Allison Lausas. Thank you. You may begin. Allison Lausas : Good morning, everyone. This is Allison Lausas, Interim Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer for IDEX Corporation. Thank you for joining us for our discussion of the IDEX third quarter 2023 financial highlights. Last night, we issued a press release outlining our company's financial and operating performance for the 3 months ending September 30, 2023. The press release, along with the presentation slides to be used during today's webcast, can be accessed on our company website at idexcorp.com. Joining me today is Eric Ashleman, our Chief Executive Officer and President. Today, we will begin with Eric providing an overview of the state of IDEX's business. I will then discuss IDEX's third quarter financial results, an update on segment performance in the markets they serve, and our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2023. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. If you should need to exit the call for any reason, you may access a complete replay beginning approximately 2 hours after the call concludes, by dialing the toll-free number (877) 660-6853 and entering conference ID 13734464, or simply log on to our company homepage for the webcast replay. Before we begin, a brief reminder. This call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbor language in last night's press release and in IDEX's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I will now turn this call over to our CEO and President, Eric Ashleman. Eric Ashleman : Thanks, Allison, and good morning, everyone. I have some important news on Slide 5. Before turning to our results and outlook, I'd like to introduce Allison Lausas, who is serving as our interim CFO. Allison has been with us for over 2 years, serving as our Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer. She also leads our Investor Relations and financial planning and analysis functions. During her tenure at IDEX, Allison has done an outstanding job, serving as a strong partner to our former CFO, Bill Grogan, and myself. Thank you, Allison, for all you're doing in your expanded interim role. And I'd also like to thank Bill for his many years of service at IDEX. Also, as you saw in our release yesterday, we are pleased to announce that Abhi Khandelwal is joining IDEX in November as our next CFO. Abhi joins us from Multi-Color Corporation, a global packaging services and label solutions provider, where he served as CFO. Prior to that, he served as Senior Vice President and CFO of CIRCOR International. He previously worked at IDEX for over 10 years, serving as my financial partner during most of my term as COO. We're thrilled to have him back with us, and I consider us very fortunate to have leaders like Abhi and Allison at the top of our finance organization. With that, I'll turn to our Q3 performance. I'm on Slide 7. IDEX delivered strong results in the third quarter, delivering robust profitability in an environment where volumes are stabilizing at lower levels. We also generated excellent cash flows as we continue to execute on our cost containment and inventory reduction plans. I'd like to thank our IDEX teams around the globe for their contributions in driving these outstanding results. This was very solid execution in a difficult environment. Recall that we expected our industrial and municipal markets within FMT and FSDP to reach the end of an elongated and moderate destocking cycle within the third quarter. That played out as expected. Our analytical instrumentation, life sciences, pharma and semicon markets within HST largely held at equilibrium in Q3 and bounced along the bottom after an unprecedented rapid destocking cycle in the first half of the year. Taken together, this moves IDEX into a very natural position, where lead times, backlogs and next quarter visibility, all aligned with typical pre-pandemic profiles. Looking forward, we continue to see divergence between end market prospects. There are discrete attractive opportunities within each of our segments, many of which are tied to transformational catalysts within environmental sustainability or critical infrastructure. Examples include water analytics, space broadband and battery production. These sit within a broader framework of uncertainty driven by macro concerns that include higher interest rates and expanding geopolitical risk. More specifically, demand rebounds for our most pressured HST businesses appear to have moved out a bit into 2024. We continue to believe that organizational agility, speed of decision-making, outstanding business quality and a strong culture serve us well to navigate the twists and turns ahead. We can both dynamically assign capital and resources to our best near-term opportunities, while we stay focused on our long-term strategy of profitable growth outperformance. In terms of capital deployment, M&A continues to be a top focus. Within our funnel builds, we are aggressively following complementary threads between our most growth advantaged businesses and technologies as we seek to build our breakthrough competitive advantage. We did this recently with our Nexsight acquisition, expanding our reach within water analytics through enhanced hardware and software capabilities. Our Iridian acquisition earlier this year boosted integrated capabilities within thin-film optics. Our inorganic pipeline is robust and of high quality, allowing us to engage in M&A with discipline and strong strategic intent. And our balance sheet has ample capacity to continue to execute on our best opportunities. Finally, we divested our Micropump business during the quarter and repaid $150 million on our term note facility. As we continue to focus on long-term growth, occasional portfolio realignment will occur. We expect this transfer of ownership will better position Micropump as it joins a collection of like-minded businesses, focused on similar technologies and customers. I would like to express my appreciation for all the Micropump team has done since joining IDEX in 1995. With that, I'll turn it over to Allison to discuss our financial results. Allison Lausas : Thanks, Eric. Moving on to our third quarter consolidated financial results on Slide 9. All comparisons are against the third quarter of 2022, unless otherwise stated. Orders of $712 million were down 9% overall and down 11% organically. We experienced an organic decrease within our HST and FMT segment and organic growth in FSD. Sales of $793 million were down 4% overall and down 6% organically. We experienced a 15% organic decrease in HST and a 1% decrease in FMT. FSD revenues grew organically by 3%. Gross margin of 44.1% decreased by 220 basis points compared with last year. Adjusted gross margin decreased 90 basis points, primarily due to lower volume leverage and unfavorable mix, which was partially offset by strong operational productivity and price costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.4%, down 30 basis points. I will discuss the drivers of adjusted EBITDA on the next slide. On a GAAP basis, our Q3 effective tax rate of 20.2% was lower than our effective rate in the third quarter of 2022 of 21.8%. The rate was driven down by both the finalization of research expenditure capitalization treatment that served to increase tax benefits on foreign source income and a tax election related to the Muon acquisition that reduced our minimum tax on foreign earnings. These favorable rate items were partly offset by tax recorded on the gain from the Micropump divestiture and are not expected to have a significant impact on our fourth quarter rate. Net income was $209 million, which resulted in GAAP EPS of $2.75. Adjusted net income was $161 million, with adjusted EPS of $2.12, which is down $0.02 or 1%. The lower tax rate contributed $0.11 of adjusted EPS favorability in the current quarter compared to both the prior year and the midpoint of our third quarter guidance. Finally, cash from operations of $227 million was up 14%, primarily due to lower working capital, driven by inventory reductions. Free cash flow for the quarter was $207 million, up 14% versus last year and achieved a conversion rate of 129% of adjusted net income. We drove over $25 million of inventory out of the business in the third quarter through our targeted reduction efforts, and we saw inventory turns remain consistent with last quarter due to lower sales. Moving on to Slide 10, which details the drivers of our third quarter adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $6 million compared to the third quarter 2022. Our 6% organic sales reduction unfavorably impacted adjusted EBITDA by $37 million flowing through at our prior year adjusted gross margin rate. Price cost was accretive to margins, and we drove operational productivity that offset employee-related inflation. Mix was unfavorable by $6 million, mainly centered in HST, due to continued volume declines in our analytical instrumentation, life science and semiconductor components. Resource and discretionary spending was favorable versus last year, as we continue to execute on our cost containment plan given the top line pressure we are experiencing. Reductions in variable compensation expense contributed $8 million of benefit in the quarter. These results yielded a negative 31% organic flow-through. Overall, our team's focus on cost containment and resource reallocation has effectively managed our revenue decline, ensuring continuity of our most valuable resources has IDEX well positioned to recover and grow back stronger than before when market dynamics turn favorable. Muon and Iridian acquisitions, net of Knight and Micropump divestitures and FX contributed an additional $9 million of adjusted EBITDA. With that, I'll provide a deeper look at our segment performance. I'm on Page 11. In our Fluid & Metering technology segment, orders decreased by 5% organically, mainly due to an expected slowdown in our industrial businesses and continued customer destocking in our agriculture business. Sales decreased by 1% organically, driven by this destocking impact, partly offset by favorable energy, chemical and water performance. We began to see our industrial order day rates decline in the second quarter of this year, and they remain steady at that level throughout the third quarter. Although our customers continue to exercise caution, due to recession concerns and lower energy prices, we see tailwinds tied to domestic infrastructure initiatives and within mining. Within agriculture, we continue to experience the impact of distribution destocking, exacerbated by declining net farm incoming crop prices. Our delivery continues to outperform our competitors, and we are focused on targeted share gain to offset this pressure. Additionally, the acquisition of KZValve and the adoption of its automated actuation technology is delivering strong results. On the energy side, we continue to execute well, driving down backlogs and lead times. Underlying market demand remains steady, but we expect to see revenue declines versus third quarter as our backlog position normalizes. In the chemical market, we continue to see positive results across the U.S., Europe and Asia, with pharma and battery applications providing opportunities for growth. Our water business continues to exhibit growth. Our opportunity funnels are increasing, and we see no signs of municipal project funding delays as we approach 2024. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 50 basis points compared to last year, primarily due to strong price cost and favorable operational productivity more than offsetting lower volume leverage. Moving to the HST segment. We experienced a 24% organic orders decrease and a 15% organic sales decrease, mainly due to pressure across the life sciences, analytical instrumentation and semiconductor markets as well as industrial market performance similar to that within FMT. Adjusted EBITDA margins contracted by 410 basis points, primarily due to lower volume leverage and unfavorable mix, partially offset by strong price cost and favorable operational productivity. Our analytical instrumentation business continues to experience customers destocking, which remains driven by China softness, lower pharma-biopharma spending and overall caution around the global economy. We expect that performance will remain stable at this level in the fourth quarter, with improvement in 2024. We see a similar trend within our life science business. Semiconductor continues to experience softness with the expectation that the market has reached a bottom in the third quarter. We anticipate a broader market will begin to recover at some point in 2024. We continue to see positive results stemming from our space, broadband laser communication initiatives, which are bolstered by Iridian's technological capabilities. Our material processing technology business continues to experience softness across pharma markets but are seeing some early signs of improvement within biopharma, food and nutrition as well as tailwinds connected to leveraging our technology and battery production application. Industrial markets and HST slowed in the quarter, in line with FMT's results. Finally, turning to our Fire & Safety Diversified Products segment. Organic orders grew by 2% versus third quarter last year and organic sales grew 3%, with strong fire and safety results more than offsetting destocking at BAND-IT. Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by 150 basis points, primarily due to strong price cost and favorable operational productivity, partially offset by unfavorable mix and lower volume leverage. The paint market remains mixed. The uncertain global macro environment is driving consumer confidence lower, while at the same time, the construction market in North America remains strong. Within our fire business, we do not see any significant changes to North America fire OEM production capacity. We continue to win through value-add integrated systems and technology and standardized offerings that enable higher OEM throughput. Our Europe and Asia businesses remain steady. Rescue performance remains steady as well, although we are seeing some signs of North American budget delays and inventory reduction due to high borrowing costs. BAND-IT continues to outperform a relatively flat U.S. auto market due to having content on high-priority vehicles. There is some pressure on the energy side, driven by lower oil prices, and we experienced some destocking within aviation. With that, I would like to provide an update on our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2023. I'm on Slide 12. In Q4, we are projecting GAAP EPS to range from $1.50 to $1.55 and adjusted EPS to range from $1.74 to $1.79. Organic revenue is expected to decline 8% to 9% and adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be about 26%. We expect that our HST revenues will be slightly unfavorable versus our previous guide, offset by FMT volumes landing better than expected. Equally, our strong execution in the third quarter allowed us to work through our backlog faster than expected. This is driving an equal and offsetting $0.05 of impact to third quarter results and fourth quarter expectations. Turning to the full year 2023. We are maintaining our full year organic revenue guidance of down 1% to 2%. At the midpoint, we have raised our EPS guidance by $0.20, with approximately $0.11 driven by lower third quarter effective tax rate and the remainder coming from third quarter operational outperformance, partly offset by $0.05 of revenue timing due to accelerated backlog burn in the third quarter. In summary, we estimate full year organic revenue contraction of 1% to 2% to yield GAAP EPS of $7.91 to $7.96 and adjusted EPS of $8.13 to $8.18. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be approximately 27.5%. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be about $80 million, and free cash flow is expected to be 100-plus percent of adjusted net income. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : First, start with congratulations on the CFO news. We've heard from a couple of former IDEX executives who are seeing obvious praises. So that's fabulous you got him to rejoin. And then can I add my thanks to Allison for all her help in her role as interim CFO. Eric Ashleman : Thanks for both comments. Allison Lausas : Thank you. Deane Dray : So maybe, Eric, for some big picture questions, macro. You're great at kind of synthesizing all the different inputs here and having knows that macro is giving us a lot of mixed signals. But maybe just click through like the day rates, that started to slow in the second quarter. What's your take on that? Lead times and anything from your leading businesses, like BAND-IT and Warren Rupp, that suggests how things are going to play out over the near term? Eric Ashleman : Yes. Well, I mean, we often refer to those as the kind of canaries in our coal mine. And we discretely track about five of those businesses and keep an eye on weekly order rates and do it at the sort of small order flow day-to-day stuff level. We parse out projects. What we can see in there is, frankly, between the second and the third quarter, they're almost dead on flat. So the kind of moderate destocking cycle that we predicted at the beginning of the year, I think, largely played out through the first half of the year and frankly, moderated. Even quarter to -- month-to-month within the quarter, we didn't see a lot of changes there. So what that says is kind of our distributors because there's a lot in that world. Our end users, all of us were kind of back to the right inventory position based on our quick replenishment, our fast lead times. And now I think it goes into the question of sort of an uncertain environment, when does it start to flex upward? Those would be the businesses. Of course, we would watch to see early indications of that. So for right now, it's flattened out. It's holding. There's decent activity out there. There's certainly opportunities here and there, but not signaling any further trouble and waiting to see if it brings forth some more encouraging signs. Deane Dray : And then the second question is in HST in the Analytical Instruments Life Sciences, and I'll preface this with -- no one has gotten this right so far. Just the -- whether it's the Thermo and Danaher and that whole group, it's been pretty fluid. And so I wanted to just see your degree of confidence that we're bottoming here because there's some suggestion that it's not just destocking, but there might be some end market demand here in this equipment, the analytical instrument side, some demand falling off. So it seems to have gotten worse in October. So just your degree of confidence, how does this calibrate the first half of '24 for this business for you? Eric Ashleman : I want to take a little time here because I think I got to set our context in relation to those comments in the environment you described. First of all, as I said in the prepared remarks, I mean, we're talking about four buckets of business primarily that kind of fall into this category. Analytical instruments, life science, of course, that's the larger piece of it. Pharma exposure as well as semicon, that's about half of HST, and that's the piece that we're describing when we walk through this. Then I want to back up and say, if you think about time line, you actually have to go back, we're almost a year into this, for us. Because of the short clinical nature, we actually saw some of this noise in Q4 of last year. And as you said, we and others, I think, have to get our heads around the fact that it's actually been a series of additive components that's played out here over the course of that year. Initially, thought it was just simply aggressive demand turning to something more moderate. Of course, we felt that in our businesses in Q4. Then, it was a reexamination of inventory positions and just frankly, seeing way too much of it at many points. And of course, that destocking played out. I think here in the second and third quarter, it's been kind of a second or third inning, if you will, of some concerns about some macro forces, probably the most significant being China's contribution or lack thereof as we -- going forward relative to what it has been in earlier periods. So there's kind of three things that played out. What I think that's done for us is, of course, we felt that pretty aggressively in the earlier piece. So there's a lot of businesses because of the component nature of the products we make. And here more moderately in the last quarter, and I can see that our backlog position, our visibility within the quarter, our kind of inventory position in factories where we supply, that's an equilibrium. So I don't see any more external forces or things that would come in there simply trying to unwind the past. That does mean, frankly, that we're kind of open to the recovery loop that's ahead of us and the uncertainty of when it will occur and how it might play out. And again, Deane, I back up a little bit and say, we're hitting that from four different levels. So while there could be some things that fall off in other places as people kind of think about demand and where they may go, maybe some of those are in the life science arenas, that we're going to have some other things that are going to potentially be working against that, that may wash that out in the interim. So equilibrium is a little bit more of a variable term for us. But I think those abnormal shocks to the system that we saw play out over the last year or so. We're essentially seeing that those are behind us. And now, like everybody else, we can lean forward, go and kind of poke the customer level and take a look at what people are doing in innovation streams and start to plan our course from here. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Halloran with Robert W. Baird. Mike Halloran : So I want to follow up to both those questions Deane asked. So just to make sure I'm clear on what you're saying on the life science analytical instrumentation side. You're not necessarily saying that you're expecting the end market to recover from here in some sort of linear fashion or anything like that? You're just saying sell-in is at the point where it's matching with sell-out? Or am I misinterpreting that? Eric Ashleman : No, I think that's good. You probably summarized it a little better than I did, but I was trying to make sure people can understand that context for us. Again, we're -- what's really important to recognize here, we're inside the life science instrument at the component level or inside the lithography instruments. So these are critical items, very fast replenishment. And so yes, I was describing us kind of unwinding a series of unnatural patterns, but we are now in sync. And we're in sync and essentially open to the same variability that, that end market is at this point. Mike Halloran : Exactly. And so as you get into next year, that's where the variability hits, but at least the comps are easy starting from, call it, mid-4Q onward type range? Eric Ashleman : Well, yes, certainly, as the year progresses, the comps get increasingly easier. Mike Halloran : Got it. And then you talked about the short cycle side of things. From a destock perspective, that makes a lot of sense. Maybe higher level, how are you thinking about the economically sensitive parts of your business as we head into '24? The risk profile, as you're seeing in, doesn't sound like the day rates are saying that there's much worsening going on, but maybe some of that's being clouded by the destock piece. So just some help as we think on a full [indiscernible]. Eric Ashleman : Yes. I mean, it is interesting. I think the industrial system is still performing at a pretty high level. I mean the day rates that we're talking about here, that flatness that I described in those canary levels, that's a pretty healthy business that suggests people are working, factories are producing things and putting it to work. Certainly around it, though, discussions around longer-term commitments or things that are going to happen in the spring of next year, I mean, they're just -- they're harder conversations to have because of all the uncertainty that people are feeling, pick anything from the higher interest rate position on the increasing geopolitical risk that's out there, consequences of a major election in the U.S. next year, right? You can see to see a lot of people on the one side continuing to kind of forecast on the things that are happening day to day, but kind of backing up with a wait-and-see approach at a higher level just because of uncertainties for anything that sort of passed the horizon. Mike Halloran : Yes, makes sense. One quick follow-up, a clarification for Allison. Did you say that $0.05 shifted from 4Q into 3Q? I just want to clarify what that statement was, Allison. Allison Lausas : That's correct, Mike. So we can find more aggressive backlog pull down in third quarter. So it's just a shift of timing within the back half of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Nathan Jones : I guess I'll ask a question about the order rates here. The order rates in FMT, the actual dollars aboard is a bit lower in 3Q than in 2Q and orders in HST in 3Q a bit lower than 2Q. Is it possible for you to kind of separate out what you think is a decline in customer backlogs versus what actual decline in end market demand? And I guess what I'm trying to get at here is, if you're talking about inventory correction having happened and we moved to selling more towards sell-through, wouldn't that imply then that you should see sequential improvement in the actual dollars of orders in both of those businesses as we move into the fourth quarter? Eric Ashleman : Yes. But well, look, again, I put a lot of weight on the predictive abilities of those early indicator businesses that we have to talk a lot about sort of day-to-day, how the system is operating. So I think that -- again, that stability means a lot. In this environment, order patterns do change a little bit. Remember, an earlier comment I had there for Mike, I mean I think you're seeing people moving to shorter increments of order patterns. They know now companies like -- I mean, certainly, IDEX, we can deliver with faster replenishment. Our customer satisfaction metrics are really good. So if you feel any uncertainty, you don't have to give us nearly the same kind of visibility in your order requirements that you had to 2 quarters ago or a year ago. So I think you do see a piece of that, that changes in the order profiling, more of a order it as you go. And so -- again, we ate into some pretty aggressive backlog along the way. At any time lead times keep coming down, I mean that does tend to influence order patterns for folks on the other side. So I think it's things like that playing out, by and large, around a pretty stable base, especially on the industrial side. To me, says, I think this is a stable environment, but one that's looking for the next catalyst. Nathan Jones : I guess my follow-up question, I know you guys don't do a lot of large projects, but you have stuff that goes into larger projects. And I think investors have been concerned that rising interest rates business in inflation, are changing the dynamics, changing the ROI for customers on those investments. Can you talk about what you're seeing on customers' willingness to let out these larger capital projects? I know historically, you've seen people hesitate in these kinds of environments. So just any color you can give us on what you're seeing there. Eric Ashleman : Yes. Well, that's probably a piece of the answer to your last question as well. I mean the certainty around projects like that is not very good. And you've got some people that are -- they're still talking about them, but they start to move that time horizon. We're getting closer to 2024 like a magnet. And so it becomes a reference point and a point in the calendar where people are pointing to when things might come to fruition in that side of it. Again, contextually for us, that's not all of our businesses, but we'll see it as part of a planned expansion commitment or something like that for food or something related to infrastructure. So those kind of discrete things that require a lot of capital will come together, a lot of planning. I think there is a lot more uncertainty around them. And it's -- instead, it's kind of running the current system faster and a little bit longer before you rebuild it due to that same level of uncertainty. Operator : Our next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Allison Poliniak : So Eric, I just want to go back to HST. One of the things IDEX has been known for is investing through the cycle. Could you maybe talk to the new product development cycle in analytical instrumentation, life sciences? Or maybe even how you're thinking about that investment? Has that slowed at all? Should we expect maybe a slower organic coming out of this? Just any thoughts there. Eric Ashleman : Well, I'm actually glad you mentioned that because, in many ways, at ground level in those businesses, you kind of see two realities sitting side by side, and they're actually quite different. One is the near-term reactive reality of what's happened over here in the last year, where order levels are and what daily requirements are, lots of cost containment and being super crisp around productivity and just getting the product out. But even at the customer level, I mean, I think you see that entire world is spending a lot of time thinking through, okay, what do we need to do to innovate to get ahead of the game in the next cycle? Because I can't find anybody that doesn't see that there's going to be something more positive coming here. The same mega trends that have been driving that sector forever are not very far out ahead of us and will occur again. But when they do, we're seeing at the customer level and within our business is a real step-up in terms of innovative steps to get after it. I was talking to Terra Teresa, who runs our businesses there, and she's describing some of the projects that we're working on in conjunction with really significant customers. And it's some of the highest degrees of innovation jumps that I've frankly, seen in the last few years. So I think there's actually a very purposeful, collaborative arrangement here to talk about where this industry is going to go. And as it comes out, this is one of the reasons I think we try to stay as fast nimble as we can, so we can put capital and resources to those best opportunities and, frankly, overfeed them in times like this. So you've actually called it exactly how we see it at a ground level. Allison Poliniak : That's great. That's good color. And then a small divestiture, as you think of the portfolio today, obviously, a very unusual cycle here. Was this sort of just a one-off? Or is this something that you think we might see more of as we go forward here? Just any thoughts. Eric Ashleman : Well, I think it was -- it's a nice little business. I think as we looked at it, we just don't have a lot of technology that's similar. We didn't see necessarily an ability to scale it. And larger-scale versions of it tend to be in markets that are not as attractive for us. So I do think that level of thinking is something that we do constantly, and you could see it play out that way from time to time. But I wouldn't view it just as this one as a massive transformational shift in portfolio for IDEX. But as we increasingly think about -- look, what we're trying to do here is drive growth outperformance, a little tighter integrated ability between the pieces of IDEX. I referenced that in the opening comments. Things that kind of stand-alone that don't have that ability to scale, we're going to take a look at, assess that carefully. And then it seems like the right decision is a potential different element, then we'll continue to make those choices. But I wouldn't sum it up to something more aggressive than that. Operator : Our next question comes from Vlad Bystricky with Citigroup. Vlad Bystricky : So maybe just one more on HST. I know you previously talked about an expectation for semicon markets to stabilize during 3Q with recovery, I think, beginning in 4Q. I don't know if I missed it, but maybe you can give us more color on how semicon markets specifically are trending versus your prior expectations and your views on the likely trajectory of semicon-related demand going forward? Eric Ashleman : Yes. Again, it's an important, but a small part of IDEX at less than 10%. But I think I think that one is pushed further into 2024. I mean it's stable here. We're certainly -- and we hit it from a variety of levels. We're in fabs. We're in metrology instruments. We're in memory. We're in sophisticated sides of it. And so we see it from a whole bunch of different spots, but I think all of it suggests the recovery of that sector is a little bit further out into 2024. We're certainly close to those customers. We're critical. They can't do much with our parts and components. So we'll get that intelligence, but I suspect the order ramp will start somewhere out into 2024. Vlad Bystricky : Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just shifting to FSDP. Again, on the orders that FSDP took a step down sequentially. So I guess just any color on, is there something seasonal there? Or just how you're thinking about FSDP orders evolving into 4Q and going forward? Allison Lausas : Sure, Vlad. No, I can take that. That's really the step down due to dispensing as that replenishment cycle did come to an end there. So you see that slowdown in the third quarter. You'll see it also a bit into fourth. But also in fourth quarter, we've got a bit of seasonality in Fire & Rescue, fewer production days. Operator : Our next question is from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Rob Wertheimer : I joined the conversation and the education on life sciences and HST has obviously been a bit more volatile than many expected. And I wonder if you could do almost like a 101, what normalization looks like? With the simpler question is, what drives customer purchasing? Is it your customers' volumes? Is it innovation cycles? Is it CapEx cycles and confidence cycles? Just how your products flow through that life cycle? Eric Ashleman : No, I appreciate it, Rob. So look, this is -- first of all, it's a super direct business. So we're talking with a relatively concentrated customer set of leading OEMs. So it's quite different from many other parts of IDEX in that respect. Up until the pandemic and some of the forces that we've seen here in the last 3 or 4 years, it's not typically been a very cyclical kind of industry. It's generally stayed at the kind of mid- to high single digits depending on where we sort of jump in, with the exception of the semi portion, of course. In all cases, you can think of this as -- these are platform-centric businesses. So an innovation stream comes in, somebody is looking to move to the next level, and it's either their instrument, or their lithography machine, or their device, is moving up well ahead of that. Our engineers are in there on the design cycle and working on the spec points and you secure the spec. So essentially, it's a pretty classic platform business. Once you're in on a platform, you run the duration of it. And you're concurrently always working on different iterations of things in either early gestation or late. So it's very, very classically aligned that way. So you do have good visibility into plans for programs, plans for program launches the variable that you run into, of course, is the adoption, the runout of those devices, the take up, the inventory positions on them, all the things that we've talked about as we've kind of gone through the last year here. Rob Wertheimer : Perfect. And if I -- I know there was a lot on that topic, but I appreciate it. And then if I can just go a little bit further field, just in the general acquisition market. You've seen cost of capital rising for private equity, perhaps faster than when you guys have pretty good cash flow are getting easier to win? Or any general characterization of that market? And I'll stop there. Eric Ashleman : Yes. Well, I mean, certainly and for -- I mean we've tried here for the last 2 or 3 years to be very, very focused on, frankly, cultivating proprietary transactions. We're taking advantage a little bit of the environment where we're comfortable. We were planning components in niche environments. We often see things and interact with people that maybe are not as well-known in the outside world. So we depend on multiyear relationships and conversations to try to get ourselves to a position where frankly, there aren't a lot of competitors in line as we're looking at an asset. That's not always possible to the extent it isn't. I would agree that you've seen something quite different here with higher interest rates. There's obviously some levels because people that need a lot of debt financing can only get to and can't pass. That will allow a property to probably stay out and play longer with strategics like us and others that might be taking a look at it. So you could view that as quite positive. I would say on the other side, though, too, because of that environment, maybe here more recently, you see some others that are a little bit more reluctant to transact in that way because they want to wait for a recovery loop or better demand curves that would support higher valuations in terminal values. So I think it's probably a little bit of wash on that side. But in many ways, we've always considered this better for us if we're working it much more discretely a bit more in the weeds and ideally in a proprietary way. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Buscaglia with BNP. Andrew Buscaglia : Looking into your FMT segment, your margins were so strong really on declining organic sales. I'm wondering, kind of tied to a question asked on HST. How do you invest from here with -- your orders are moderating or declining into year-end. How do you tie that to your margins in the context of protecting them? Or if your outlook, it sounds like everything is as expected. So do you continue to invest here? Just kind of seeing where your head is at with where that market is going and what it means for margins? Eric Ashleman : Yes. Well, a couple of things here. Well, first, I'm glad you noticed. I mean the FMT segment, in particular, I mean, has fantastic performance. Over the last couple of quarters, Q3 was really good. And what you're seeing there is, look, reasonable cost containment, we run them -- we're in those businesses pretty lean anyways. It's much easier to run them at a steady state than kind of the last few years have been. So that brings out our best. And frankly, our teams have recognized, they're doing their part from an IDEX side and really drive an outstanding performance. I would say from an investment profile, I mean these are businesses, some of which are 80, 90, 100 years old. They are really, really well positioned. They do very well in almost all versions of economic realities that are out there. So making sure that they stay innovative, well positioned with the right channel partners, out in the right places, that's something we're always thoughtful of. We -- typically, the investments when we talk about growth investments. They're generally people based. And they are often discrete additive things that we'll do to go at certain things like battery production to support mobility -- e-mobility economy or something like that. So we'll augment and make those investments, or not, depending on how we view kind of the staying in the outside world. But the base of the business, just the kind of core of the franchise, we are really, really careful of that to make sure that, that domain expertise that supports all that positioning, and differentiation and incredible margins is sound for any reality. Andrew Buscaglia : And so that mid -- kind of mid-30s EBITDA margin well into the low 30s operating margins, is really sustainable in your view, even if those order trends continue to go negative, and organic sales just -- yes, it weakens into 2024? Eric Ashleman : I mean there's a couple of things to keep in mind there. At any point, and we've seen it a couple of times over the last few years, if that business gets kind of close to flat or negative, the deleveraging side of things is really tough because of the strong contribution margins and our commitment to kind of maintain the core. So depending where things go, we always have to be aware of that. We are also at probably the best point of the price cost cycle here now. That's -- the spread that we're at today is probably not going to continue out into the future. We've always been a company that gets price. Of course, it's been more aggressive here lately with inflation. We're now at a point where those prices are sticky. There's some moderation on the inputs. This is the best part of the cycle, and this is the best part of the company that gets that pricing. So there's a little bit of a piece on here. I'd be careful of is assuming it's perpetual state, it's the good part of this part of the cycle. Operator : Our next question comes from Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Brett Linzey : Just one more on HST. So encouraging to see the stabilization and certainly, the recovery path is going to take some time to play out and figure out. But just in terms of the profit recovery on the other side, should we think of the businesses yielding a stronger-than-average incremental margin as they do or when they do recover? Or do you need some cost to come back? Any way to dimension that? Allison Lausas : As we recover, they'll lever nicely. And so a longer-term expectation for the HST set of businesses is more in the EBITDA margins of 29%-plus. Brett Linzey : Okay. Great. And then just shifting over to the comments you made on water. It sounds like the opportunity funnel is increasing. You might be able to size that. And is it related to some of the fiscal stimulus or other independent factors driving that strength? Eric Ashleman : Yes. Well, I mean, the water side of things has been steady throughout. I would say it's indirectly related, of course, to a lot of the focused efforts to invest in our infrastructure. Frankly, the state of our infrastructure has now gotten to the point where it's impossible to look away from as well. We've seen that on a major scale in major cities, certainly here in the U.S. I think those two things together are putting in -- I've always thought of it as a warm blanket, multiyear blanket. It's just -- it takes a long time to spend money in that sector. These projects are just -- they take a long time to engineer rollout and go out there. And so no matter how discrete the kind of pop on funding might be, it's always going to have a little bit of an elongated run out. So we sort of view that as a comfortable blanket for businesses like ours and others that are in this sector. We've seen that. It's held up again in this quarter as well. I mean to dimensionalize it, you can look at the size of water in IDEX, and it's -- again, it's a nice piece of the portfolio, and we would see that it would stay at the upper end of the growth profile. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. Joe Giordano : I just want to clarify. A lot of the -- your customers and stuff in HST and the areas of weakness now have been kind of talking about October got worse. So I know that you were very clear that like the inventory situations and destocks have normalized, but what did your actual orders kind of look like in October relative to the rest of the quarter? Like do you think HST orders, should we be thinking up in dollars versus the third quarter and the fourth quarter? Does that make sense? Eric Ashleman : Look, I'll let -- go ahead, Allison. Allison Lausas : Sure. No, I think, on a pure dollar basis, we should expect to see some higher orders in the fourth quarter. But there is some blanket activity also that happens as we wrap the year. Joe Giordano : Okay. So that maybe not necessarily a sign that things are improving, it's just kind of a seasonal order uptake? Allison Lausas : That's right. We'll need to be -- we'll need to keep close watch. Joe Giordano : At what point -- just extension of that, just given like the nature of that business and the fact that you're running kind of book-to-bill sub-1 there still. So like at what point, can you -- there's like an organic decline in HST kind of be like baked in for 2024? Like when do orders need to start to improve for that to be a positive number theoretically? Eric Ashleman : Look, I think we'd have to monitor this pretty -- we obviously will through the balance of the fourth quarter. As always, everybody kind of does the same planning cycles at the same time. So that's the best opportunity for us to get in front of customers, talk about programs, things that they're launching, their confidence in them. I think we want to watch it quarter by quarter and stay super close to it. These are the most dynamic markets that we have in the whole place. I just -- I come back to kind of the comments I made. I think when Mike asked the question, he did such a good job summarizing it in the beginning. We're basically saying that we've taken all of the inventory-related noise out of this, and that's essentially the echo of the past. I will say, to the extent the industry heads in different directions here, we are in sync with it. We're a critical component supplier for folks that are making very sophisticated instruments and things for a variety of different markets and geographies. And we are somewhat dependent on -- we are completely dependent on their success, their call, the way that they're seeing that those markets are going to traverse. What we can do from our side is to provide, I think, a timely and relevant diagnostic. Mainly, because of the fact we're so short cycle. And we're going to feel and see those inflections sooner than almost anybody. And so with that in mind, we need to stay close to them. We'll understand all of those things. Again, it's four buckets of business for us, occasionally move at slightly different rates, and we can move resources around. So we'll see how it plays out as we go through '24. Joe Giordano : That's fair. And just last, with the accelerated kind of backlog burn that you had this quarter, are there targeted opportunities to do that again in the fourth quarter in parts of your business? Eric Ashleman : We still have a couple of businesses that have longer backlogs. I mean they're still working through generally because lingering issues in supply chains and elsewhere. We spoke of one in energy, where we talked about is pretty strong in the third quarter. A lot of that was us getting some more of that backlog out related to some consolidation stuff that we've done about a year ago. It's not many of them, but we do have a couple of other pockets in here that we're trying to get back down to kind of all IDEX level. Operator : We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Eric Ashleman for closing comments. Eric Ashleman : Okay. Well, thanks for everybody for joining our call. And as I always do, I want to thank the members of the IDEX team that are on for really, really strong execution and performance in the quarter. I just -- a few comments here. I think there's certainly -- look, there's a lot of uncertainty out there in the environment. I think it's going to require a certain amount of patience. But as I think about IDEX and the things that we can control, here's what I know. I know our portfolio is in great shape. It's growing through M&A. It's well positioned, certainly to support long-term growth outperformance. I really think our flat and decentralized structure keeps us agile and nimble. We can move things around and resource things probably faster than anybody, and we do that each and every day. And our teams and leaders are outstanding and frankly, they're going to be outstanding plus one as Abhi joins us here in November. So with that, when things break, we'll be all set up here, I think, to really support a nice extended run for IDEX as the world starts to dial in, and respond to, frankly, the trends that we know are all coming. So with that, thanks for your support, and have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference over to Allison Lausas, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer. Ms. Lausas, you may now begin. Allison Lausas : Good morning, everyone. This is Allison Lausas, Vice-President and Chief Accounting Officer for IDEX Corporation. Thank you for joining us for our discussion of the IDEX fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 financial highlights. Last night, we issued a press release outlining our company's financial and operating performance for the three months and full-year ending December 31, 2023. The press release along with the presentation slides to be used during today's webcast can be accessed on our company website at idexcorp.com. Joining me today are Eric Ashleman, our Chief Executive Officer and President; and Abhi Khandelwal, our new Senior Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer. Today, we will begin with Eric, providing an overview of the state of IDEX's business. Abhi will then discuss our fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 financial results and provide an update on the various markets we serve. He will also discuss our outlook for the first quarter and full-year 2024. Lastly, Eric will close the call with his final remarks. We will then open the call for your questions. If you should need to exit the call for any reason, you may access a complete replay beginning approximately two hours after the call concludes by dialing the toll-free number (877) 660-6853 and entering conference ID 13742102, or simply log on to our company homepage for the webcast replay. Before we begin a brief reminder. This call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the Safe Harbor language in last night's press release and in IDEX's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I will now turn this call over to our CEO and President, Eric Ashleman. Eric Ashleman : Thanks, Allison, and good morning everyone. First, I'd like to introduce and welcome our new CFO, Abhi Khandelwal back to IDEX. Abhi previously worked at IDEX for 10 years and served as my finance partner for the majority of that tenure. I'm thrilled to welcome them back. And in many ways, it feels like you never left. Turning to Slide 6. We navigated the challenging backdrop in 2023 with really strong execution. As backlogs normalized, we took inventory out of the system, reduced lead times for customers, increased cash-flow to record levels, and delivered productivity through strong price capture and operational excellence. As always, I want to reach out to our IDEX employees around the globe with a sincere and appreciative thank you. I want to apply a bit of high level perspective as I covered last year's dynamic demand patterns. Coming into 2023, we expect this would be a year of re-calibration across our broad array of markets and our thesis certainly held. Our fragmented industrial markets within FMT and parts of FSDP and HST played out as expected. Supply chains improved, dropping overall lead times bringing artificially high backlog and inventory levels into focus. Customers attack these positions moderately over time through order reductions to our businesses, ultimately reaching levels of stability for us in the fall. Our less fragmented markets within Life Sciences and Analytical Instrumentation and Semicon recalibrated in a dramatically different way. Through much of the post pandemic recovery, these markets had run red-hot with demand that was really only constrained by supply chain availability. Demand pressures from high interest rates, lower capital availability and a lackluster post-COVID recovery in China, combined with outside inventory balances and backlogs drove sharp order reductions throughout these normally fast-growing sectors. This played out dramatically in the first half for IDEX. Given our short-cycle character, we saw the decline quicker than many and reached equilibrium in the fall sooner than some. As we delivered against expectations within a stable Q4, we took a breath and developed a plan of attack for the year ahead. Lead times and backlogs are back to pre-pandemic levels. The majority of our industrial and municipal businesses are stable and seeing improvement with early and encouraging signs of modest growth ahead. The open questions are the specific catalysts and timing to support further acceleration. Our teams continue to aggressively engage with our top growth bets to drive market out performance. These initiatives are spread across all segments in a variety of niche verticals. We're particularly excited about our growth work with customers in our water, Semicon, space communications, and energy transition markets. The markets not yet showing signs of near-term recovery remains Life Sciences and Analytical Instrumentation. We haven't forecasted a positive inflection yet for 2024. That said, our teams continue to work a robust pipeline of innovative projects in conjunction with our customers, positioning us to win on tomorrow's Next-Gen platforms. We believe in the long-term growth potential of these end markets and are well-positioned to support growth at the first signs of improved demand. We continue to focus on aggressive capital deployment towards M&A as we tune the portfolio towards faster-growing high-quality markets. We acquired Iridian and STC Material Solutions last year, adding important pieces of material science technology to our HST segment. Our funnel is expanding, filled with targets that enhance our growth potential. Our balance sheet is strong, fully supporting our ambitions. Finally, we divested two businesses Micropump and Novotema as we practice AD20 at the enterprise level. With that, I'll turn it over to Abhi to discuss our financial results. Abhi Khandelwal : Thanks, Eric, and thanks to everyone for welcoming me back to IDEX. It's great to be here and be re-joining a great organization. Moving onto the consolidated financial results on Slide 8. All comparisons are against the prior year period unless stated otherwise. Orders of $754 million in the fourth quarter were down 6% overall, and down 10% organically. We experienced an organic decrease in each of our three segments. FMT and FSDP declined mid-single-digits while HST contracted by about 17% as market stabilized at a new level post-recalibration. For the year orders were down 7% overall, and down 11% organically. Our HST segment contracted upwards of 20% as customer experienced a sharp inventory recalibration during the year and level-set to new near-term demand targets that include stunted growth expectations for China coming out of the pandemic. Our FMT and FSDP segments were down low-single digits as they also experienced recalibration although at a much smaller scale. Fourth quarter sales of $789 million were down 3% overall, and down 6% organically. We experienced a 19% organic decrease in HST while both FMT and FSDP grew by 3% organically. Full-year sales of $3.3 billion were up 3% overall and down 1% organically. HST contracted by 10% on an organic basis driven by declining life sciences analytical instrumentation and semiconductor markets, partially offset by price. FMT and FSDP grew mid-single-digits, driven largely by strong price capture on slightly higher volumes. Fourth-quarter gross margin was essentially flat at 42.7% while adjusted gross margin, which was also 42.7% contracted 90 basis points due to lower volume leverage, unfavorable mix and the dilutive impact of acquisitions and divestitures, partially offset by strong price-cost and operational productivity. Both full-year gross margin and adjusted gross margin of 44.2% contracted 60 basis points for the same reasons I just described. Fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 25.8%, down 120 basis points. I will discuss the drivers of fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA on the next slide. On a full-year basis adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 40 basis points to 27.5%. A bridge of the full-year adjusted EBITDA can be found in the appendix of this presentation. Despite a year of significant volume pressure, our teams delivered on price-cost and operational productivity, significantly muting the impact of these unprecedented volume declines. On a GAAP basis, our Q4 effective tax rate of 22.7% versus last year's fourth-quarter effective tax rate of 20.5% increased primarily due to the absence of one-time foreign currency benefits realized in 2022 in connection with the funding of the acquisition of Muon as well as the impact of the loss recorded on the sale of Novotema during 2023. For which no related tax benefit was realized due to the type of consolidated group in which it participated. Our full-year GAAP effective tax rate of 21.7% was flat with the prior year. However, both 2023 and 2022 included favorable discrete events. Fourth-quarter net income was $109 million generating EPS of $1.43. Adjusted net income was $139 million with adjusted EPS of $1.83, down $0.18 from the prior year fourth quarter. Full-year net income was $596 million, resulting in EPS of $7.85. Adjusted net income was $624 million. Generating adjusted EPS of $8.22, up $0.10 or 1% from last year. Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $179 million, up 22% over the prior year period. We achieved a conversion rate of 129% of adjusted net income, mainly driven by improved working capital performance despite lower adjusted net income. On an organic basis, we drove more than $40 million of inventory reduction in the quarter through our targeted reduction efforts and we saw inventory turns improve. For the year we delivered record free cash flow of $627 million, up 28% versus last year and coming in at 101% of adjusted net income. Mainly driven by lower net working capital as we reduced organic inventory levels by almost $65 million and achieved higher adjusted net income. We achieved this despite higher year-over-year capital expenditure as we maintain focus on investing for the future. We will continue to drive inventory levels down and optimize working capital levels further in 2024. Moving on to Slide 9 which details the drivers of our fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $15 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Our 6% organic sales reduction unfavorably impacted adjusted EBITDA by $36 million, flowing through at our prior year adjusted gross margin rate. Price cost was accretive to margins and we drove operational productivity that offset employee-related inflation. Mix was unfavorable by $3 million. Reductions in variable compensation contributed $3 million of benefit in the quarter. These results yielded a negative 39% organic flow-through. Overall, our team's focus on cost containment and resource reallocation has effectively managed our revenue declines. IDEX is well-positioned to recover and grow back stronger than before when market dynamics turn favorable. The impact of FX and acquisitions, net of divestitures contributed $5 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. However, the divestiture of Micropump load flow-through as the margins were higher than those of our newly acquired assets who were experiencing volume deleveraging, given the end markets deplane. With that, I will provide a deeper look at our segment performance. I'm on Slide 10. Let me walk you through our outlook as it relates to our end markets. First, as I consider the markets served by our Fluid & Metering technology segment. Industrial derates began to see some sequential improvement in the fourth quarter and we expect continued stability in the near-term as our short-cycle businesses meet underlying customer demand. We continue to see normalized book-and-bill order patterns given shorter lead times and normalized supply chain dynamics. As we move into 2024, we're cautiously optimistic as we continue to see tailwinds due to domestic infrastructure initiatives and within mining. We anticipate these patterns will hold. Dolby will continue to mind our derates to evaluate longer-term expectations as this is the most short-cycle market exposure. Our water businesses continue to be favorably positioned as we enter 2024. Municipal project activity remains strong with no signs of funding delays and the project funnel is healthy with new opportunities winning share to deliver solutions for critical water challenges. Our energy business has been steady, even as new oil production is down and fuel markets are flat, driven by declining fuel prices and mild heating seasons in North America and Europe. As consolidation occurs within this industry and funding for new projects remain delayed, we see operators doing more with less using the same infrastructure to drive production. These market dynamics favorably impact our demand profile. As our energy businesses meet customers' need for replacements as they keep existing infrastructure running. In the chemical market, we continue to see positive results across US and Europe with pharma and battery applications providing opportunities for growth. China softness is being mitigated by the rest of Asia. The one area experiencing pronounced headwinds in FMT is our agricultural business. The size of this market is about 10% of the FMT segment, which equates to mid-single-digits for overall IDEX. We continue to see headwinds as OEMs have stepped down their projections due to continued destocking and declining net farm income and crop prices. Our KZValve acquisition continues to be a differentiator with its automated actuation valve technology and we are focused on targeted share gain to offset the pressure of current market challenges. Moving onto the Health & Science Technologies segment. We continue to see positive results stemming from our space broadband laser communication initiatives which are bolstered by Iridian's technological capabilities. We expect this space to grow in 2024. The industrial markets served by businesses in the HST segment are experiencing signals in line with FMT has expectations. Our material processing technology business is gaining share in battery production with the step up in new orders as we enter the year. And we continue to see signs of improvement within biopharma related to new vaccine development, where our technologies are uniquely positioned. We see particular strength in emerging markets. For semiconductor, we began to see initial signs of improvement as we exited 2023. We expect this market will continue to recover somewhat in '24 driven by an improved outlook for memory chips due to demand for devices. Further out, we look forward to continued growth in Semicon driven by artificial intelligence, automotive and long-term secular tailwinds driven by electrification. While these markets point towards growth area within the HST, that is not yet showing signs of recovery is in our Life Sciences and Analytical Instrumentation markets, which represents nearly 35% of HST and about 15% of overall IDEX. However, the long-term growth drivers have not changed. While orders appear to be stabilizing, we have not forecasted a positive inflection yet for 2024. While this industry navigates immediate-term challenges, we continue to have our eye on the future. We are closely partner with our customers across our Life Sciences businesses and we're actively innovating to provide tomorrow solution. With our focus on innovation and operational scale to support customers from prototyping to production we are uniquely positioned for growth as these markets recover. Turning to our Fire & Safety Diversified Products. We expect FSDP will be flattish to down slightly in 2024 driven by headwinds in dispensing as key customers recently completed the multi-year refreshment cycle. We expect Fire & Safety end markets to remain stable and growth to be driven by strategic share gain initiatives our teams are focused on. We continue to win through value-added integrated systems and technology and standardized offerings that enable higher OEM throughput. Overall demand Band-it continues to remain strong and we expect growth on a year-over-year basis. With that, I'd like to provide an update on our outlook for the first quarter and full-year 2024. I'm on Slide 11. We expect full-year organic growth of 0% to 2% with the majority of our end markets stable to growing as I highlighted in my market outlook commentary. This wage reflects low-single-digit growth from FMT and includes acknowledgment of the uncertainty in timing and scale of recovery given the short-cycle nature of our business. For HST we expect low-single-digit growth as broader expectations for year-over-year growth across its markets are moderated by the lack of visibility in the Life Sciences and Analytical Instrumentation space. And we expect FSDP to be down slightly as the dispensing refreshment cycle has completed and volume in that space will step down. The dynamic is expected to lower overall IDEX organic growth by 1% and offset the growth expected by Fire & Safety and Band-it. This organic rate guide equals earnings per share contraction of $0.03 to growth of $0.26 depending on top-line results and includes price-cost, which we anticipate will be positive for the year and mixed pressure stemming from dispensing volumes. Additionally, we expect our operational productivity will more than offset pressure from wage-related inflation and provide $0.10 to $0.15 of EPS growth. As always, we're committed to investing in the future growth prospects and expect to make incremental resource investments of $0.05 to $0.09 during the year as we invest in the people needed to champion our growth efforts and drive the next chapter for outperformance. The reset of variable compensation levels after a challenging 2023 provides a $0.16 headwind while the impact of recent acquisitions and divestitures contributes $0.12 of adjusted EPS growth. Finally, considering a few non-operational items lower levels of debt due to pay-downs in the second half of 2023 are expected to yield $0.07 of EPS growth and we expect FX to also provide $0.07 of benefit. These are more than offset by an increase in the effective tax rate on a year-over-year basis, creating $0.19 of headwinds to adjusted EPS. The 2023 effective tax rate includes certain discrete events, which produced $0.09 of benefit to adjusted EPS in '23, as compared to 2022. Those benefits do not repeat in 2024 and conversely, the projected 2024 rate of 23%, includes a heavier mix of improved performance in geographical regions with higher tax rates, as well as certain legislative changes increasing global tax. So in summary, we're projecting organic revenue growth of 0% to 2% for the year. The variable compensation and tax-rate pressure essentially erodes 4% of EPS growth year-over-year lending adjusted EPS expectation in the range of $8.15 to $8.45 or down 1% to up 3% over 2023. Moving to Slide 12. I'll provide additional details regarding our 2024 guidance for both our first quarter and full-year. In Q1, we are projecting GAAP EPS to range from $1.45 to $1.50 and adjusted EPS to range from $1.70 to $1.75. Organic revenue is expected to decline 6% to 7% year-over-year due to tough comps and adjusted EBITDA margins are estimated to be about 25%. While it is not a factor impacting year-over-year comparability, I would like to remind you that on a sequential basis when walking from fourth-quarter results to first-quarter we have a headwind of $0.10 related primarily to the accelerated recognition of share-based compensation in the first-quarter of each year. Turning to the full-year 2024, in summary, we estimate full-year organic revenue of flat to up 2%, to yield GAAP EPS of $7.15 to $7.45 and adjusted EPS of $8.15 to $8.45. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be approximately 28%. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be about $75 million normalized upon the completion of certain factory automation investments and emerging market footprint expansion in 2023. And free cash flow is expected to be over 100% of adjusted net income. Corporate costs are also expected to be approximately $95 million, up from 2023 by approximately $10 million as variable compensation resets to current market expectations, With that, I'll turn it over to Eric for closing remarks. Eric Ashleman : Thanks, Abhi. I'm on Slide 13. In summary, the majority of our businesses are stable and starting to see the early days of market recovery. We're working together as a team to drive out performance above that baseline and we are well-positioned to capitalize on growth to come as we invest our cash-back into the business to support organic and inorganic expansion. Our core FMT businesses are back in world-class lead times with expanded margins, they're ready to expand them again as volume leverage broadly returns. Fire & Safety and Band-It within FSDP have differentiated technologies to accelerate growth and continue as the leading players in their global markets. Much of HST is seeing recovery or the early signs of growth. We temper these expectations a bit, overall, given our lack of insights supporting demand recovery within Life Sciences and Analytical Instrumentation markets, and we also face the cyclical headwinds from global dispensing in our agriculture businesses. Finally, it's really the early days of a new normal following three years of unprecedented change, better to be appropriately cautious and careful as we line up our resources and strategic plans to support the full cycle ahead. One I feel will be especially strong for companies like ours. We are prepared to help customers solve their toughest problems we see as their greatest opportunities, our businesses and technologies are outstanding. Our teams and talent are world-class and our culture is really unique. We appreciate your support and interest in IDEX. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question will be coming from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions. Nathan Jones : Good morning, everyone. Welcome back, Abhi. Abhi Khandelwal : Thank you, Nathan. Nathan Jones : I just wanted to start off with a question on inventory destocking bonuses demand. I guess it's most appropriate to the Life Sciences and Analytical Instrumentation businesses. Obviously, sharp declines you saw in 2023, is there any way for you to parse out or give this more color around what you think was actually called declines in your customers' demand versus them taking down their levels of inventory of your products? Eric Ashleman : Yeah. Well, certainly the second is much larger than the first probably outlet by a level of two. So, we saw these kind of double-digit declines here pushing I think 20% at some point. I don't think that's representative of their underlying markets, and we haven't seen that in the public comments for them either. So this really was an incredible run-up and then, obviously, kind of an artificial plunge down as those things were normalized. So where is the state of their markets? Down low-single digits to maybe slightly double or the early start of double. But again, I think one of the main points we want to make sure people understand is while the comparisons even in Q4 for were dramatically different for us and we could continue to see that calibration, we've actually been living in-kind of a sequential level of stability here for a while now. And we were talking about in late summer and certainly saw through the bulk of the fourth quarter and are now projecting that more formally across '24. And so it's kind of a case of two realities, one that's going to for a while now continue to still have those year-over-year comparisons, because of the market difference we have 12 months ago the periods we're going to move through at least through the first half of the year. But a relatively stable platform here. Just lacking a little bit of visibility as to when that catalyst comes in there, that starts to accelerate again. Nathan Jones : Yeah. I was looking at the order rates in HST and they've certainly stabilized over the last couple of quarters. There is a sequential improvement from 3Q to 4Q. Can you possibly parse out the different pieces in HST sequentially on the order rates, where you're seeing things improve versus the Life Sciences and Analytical Instrumentation or where it's going on a sequential basis? Eric Ashleman : Yeah. A couple of things there and Abhi can fill in anything I miss. But I mean, we do get a little bit more blanket activity at the end of the year even in those core lifecycle Analytical Instrumentation market, there is a little step-up there. About half of HST is kind of classically more industrial anyways and mirrors a lot of what we have over in FMT. And so that same kind of broader support and early indicators of growth that I know we'll talk about a lot here on the call we saw that kind of hit that Thanksgiving time on there too. So that accounts for a piece of it. Little bit of activity on the Semicon side, although that's real early days and modest too. So, nothing really on the declining side. A few things moving up. The only thing, again, most of it just sort of reflective of broad-based support with that one exception of a little bit of year-end blanket activity on the Life science world. Abhi Khandelwal : Yeah, Nathan. The only thing I'd add is, if you look at the sequential order lift in HST we are up about $30 million. Majority of that to Eric's point was demand, there about $10 million of blanket activity that happens typically year-over-year. But to Eric's point, we saw orders improve starting Thanksgiving through December. Nathan Jones : And then I guess last one, just across the portfolio. Your customers' level of inventory now, I mean, you guys talked about still taking your inventory down in the first half of '24. Do you think your customers are still accepting similar and there is still a headwind from destocking in the first half of '24 and when do you think we'll actually get to a point where customer inventories match demand levels? Eric Ashleman : Yeah. I mean I would say I'd parse that out a bit, too I mean, a lot of inventory that would be closest to us on the FMT side would be largely in distributor channels and places like that, highly fragmented, that's largely corrected now. We never as -- we always remind you we don't sell a lot of products that stock real well, anyways. So we probably hit quicker levels there may be some, but we're good on that side. On the OEM side, I think it's customer-by-customer, but between us and our end-customers I mean we're really, clean. And a lot of that's just been driven by the fact that we got back to really, high levels of customer performance and lead-time performance early and then even if nobody is monitoring that in a manual way eventually and pretty quickly and it automates. And so, kind of, then ties those two things together. The only piece of course that we can't quite see would be, end-customer solutions inventory way out into the extended nature of their channels and we hear about pockets of it here and there from different places, but again the fragmentation and the diversification of IDEX I think puts us in a place where no one or two of those places is going to upset the balance much. Nathan Jones : Excellent. Thanks very much for taking my questions. Abhi Khandelwal : Thanks, Nathan. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions. Allison Poliniak : Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to ask on the Life Sciences side, new product development, I think you mentioned it was ongoing. Could you talk to it relative to historicals, like, how it's pacing is stronger, is it sort of the same amount of investments? And then just any, fairly large reset in that business as well. Has any of the competitive dynamics changed as a result of that? Just any thoughts there. Thanks. Eric Ashleman : Yeah. No. Great questions and early here in the year there's a number of conferences and trade shows and things that always reoccur. So it's a good time to, have good touch points with people. I will tell you and I think I've said this the last couple of quarters, the level of innovation that's happening between our folks on the ground and our major customers is at a really strong level. And, I think if you step back a second, I mean, it actually makes sense Intuitively. It's a tough environment. People are coming off of a phase where largely it was about replenishment and trying to make things. And now I think there's a recognition, it's back to dynamics that are a bit more normal. You've got real competition between some very, very serious and well-established customers. Innovation in this sector is going to lead the way. And then if you look at the way that we typically interface with IDEX, I mean, we're really good at scaling with customers. So, we're hearing a lot of things now around, can you get the prototypes done sooner? Because if we do that, then that gives you the scalable production right behind it. And so I think that's as healthy as I've seen it. And in many ways to the extent that people are grappling with their own dimensions of trying to normalize cost and potentially might not have as many resources. That actually in well for the kind of work that we do as well, because we've got now a full suite of integrated capabilities. So, I think that side of it actually is our most healthy barometer about long-term, success here for both us and the sector. Competitive dynamics, there's not a ton of names in this world, I think we've good understanding of where we stack up and how we're positioned in our share. So I feel very good about, we've maintained if not enhanced our position with all the major players. And then, we continue to follow how they're doing as they battle it out side-by-side. And I always feel very good about the number of bets that we have with virtually all of them. Allison Poliniak : Got it. Understood. And then just on working capital. I know you mentioned you wanted to bring it down. Is there any target that you're focused on and trying to attain in '24? Just any thoughts there. Thanks. Abhi Khandelwal : Yeah, Allison. As we mentioned in our opening remarks, we took down inventory about $65 million in 2023, which is about a 0.4 point improvement as we think of 2024 we're targeting another 0.5 point of improvement from an inventory standpoint. Allison Poliniak : Got it. Thanks for the color. Abhi Khandelwal : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Baird. Please proceed with your questions. Mike Halloran : Good morning, everyone. Eric Ashleman : Good morning, Mike. Mike Halloran : So let's just start on the overall thought process for the year. Certainly appreciate all the color, prepared remarks. But as you think about how you're conceptually setting the guidance here, is the thought that you're basically looking for sequential stability across the platform from current levels, understanding that the ag piece, the dispencing piece, have some cyclical pressures. But the remaining pieces is just relatively normal cyclicality, not assuming an inflection or should we be thinking about those positive catalyst markets as you're pushing some sort of inflection in the numbers this year as an offset, and then maybe just talk about how you're expecting that cadencing to workout. Eric Ashleman : Yeah. I'll kind of hit it from a revenue and demand side and let Abhi sort of square up how it financially tracks alongside of it. But, yeah, I think if you move from left to right, kind of start at the midpoint of last year. Again, we saw a back half that was pretty stable for us. Slight reductions in final reductions in backlog, but really ended the year with a normalized position. And I'll remind people that for IDEX what that means is, we turn things really, really fast, it gives us about a half a quarter of visibility when we stand here, here on January 1 looking at it. So we're kind of back to equilibrium in that perspective. And then, we started to see this sort of broader support emerging out of the snow, if you will in the end of Q4 and continuing through January. January was a nice start for us in all three segments. And so then as you project forward, you're right, Mike, we actually have a -- it's a little bit of a seasonal uptick for us, that's fairly typical from Q1 to Q2. We've not been able to see it the last couple of years because of some different dynamics that have been out there that's simply weather-related and hits businesses like water and a few others. And so we have a natural uptick there. Some of these early bookings and some of the support that we've seen just given our lead times and customer expectations kind of dials in around Q2 as well. So there's a little bit of an additive bounce there and explains a bit of a difference between Q1 and Q2. We have a series of growth bets that of course we have positioned across all verticals. I offered a few highlights in the opening comments. Those are known programs, known platforms we're engaged on those now and we feel more assured about when they're going to start along the way. And then we have things like, a slight recovery in the semiconductor markets kind of modeled more back-half than the first. So, I think it's normal IDEX, certainly a normal entry position as we look at the year some normal seasonality, normal run-out of growth bets that we have that accelerate through the year. Made a little bit more exaggerated, I think by, certainly a conservative call on the first quarter, given that we just landed here. We just landed here, we're seeing some things come together and we just kind of have a -- there is a little bit of an air pocket here just based on lead times as to where those things land and how quickly we can get at them. Abhi Khandelwal : Yeah, Mike. Just to add a little more color to it as you kind of-- just to build on Eric's commentary here. So if you go from left to right, kind of think about where we ended Q4. We ended Q4 at $1.83, as I move the pencil forward and look at, what we're seeing in Q1, again to Eric's point, we took a bit of a conservative view. Just sequentially, we expect operationally to get better by $0.12 to $0.15. So if you just look at operationally, $1.83 at $0.15 to it you have not $1.98 closer to $2. Year-over-year, it doesn't matter sequentially as I think about it, what does impact us is a $0.10 stock-comp timing and then $0.04 of variable comp reset that kind of takes our guide down to what we've laid up in the paper here from $1.75 to $1.77. But sequentially as you look at it operationally, we are seeing the improvement that Eric is talking about, it's early days. But as Eric mentioned we build backlog in January, majority of that is shippable in Q2 and beyond and then you see a seasonal uptick from Q1 to Q2. Mike Halloran : Great. Super helpful. And then, just an update on how you're looking at the M&A landscape here actionability of the portfolio. I mean, from loss of opportunity, I'm guessing it's probably not that different than what you talked about the last few quarters, the last couple of years, but any revenue update you have? Eric Ashleman : Yeah. No, it continues to be an area of tremendous focus I think irrespective of what the backdrop is. We've driven the increases in potential there with funnel build and cultivation and conversations and analysis and other things that really are at the highest level we've ever had in the company. I do think though that as maybe the year feel some of the same, fundamental support that we're talking about here, I could imagine that that might help availability of targets and people might start to think about monetizing them and moving and maybe they lift the market around us as well. So it's still largely being driven by our efforts, but I think a good environment and we feel very, very positive about what we're going to be able to do there. Mike Halloran : Great. Really appreciate everyone. Eric Ashleman : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Eric Ashleman : Hi, Deane. Abhi Khandelwal : Good morning, Deane. Deane Dray : Hey. Just want to also add my welcome back to Abhi and also thanks for all the detail and how you've laid out the assumptions very, very clear. We appreciate all the specifics. Abhi Khandelwal : Thank you, Deane. Deane Dray : I want to circle back on the Life Sciences Analytical story here and just make sure I understand how you're not expecting and not forecasting any inflection in '24 and I get that you want to be conservative here because it's been a moving target. But if you listen to what your customers are saying, in terms of their earnings reports and how they're forecasting they're collectively talking if I were to generalize that there would be still some inventory normalization running at least through the midyear, so call it the end of the second quarter. And at that point, they would start to see some normalization, some recovery. They've got easy comps in the second half. So, I would imagine maybe there is a timing issue for you and to when that would start to read across into your recovery with these customers. But let's just start there, just what's the lead timing difference in terms of that recovery because it does seem like it pivot this year. Eric Ashleman : Yeah. From an inventory reduction perspective, I mean, again, this is a big industry with a lot of end markets, we have different platforms, different programs and all of them. So, I mean we really get it down to customer-by-customer, factory-by-factory and inventory position between us and them in every single case. So we've known for a while that, we're in pretty lockstep at that level. Then it comes down to individual demand swings and to be fair, there'll be some and maybe in line with what you're talking about there is some pockets of end-customer inventory that might still be out there and in the way of recovery and pieces of what we have. But in other places, I think we're comfortable that the mix is going to work over and kind of hold the flat narrative that we have here and the flat projections that we have internally. Absolutely I've heard some of the same commentary around the back half. I don't have information to refute any of that and I'd be quite happy if it were to come about that way. But I think just from an internal planning and forecasting perspective. Being conservative in this way, making sure our costs are in control, we've got everything ready to go from a materials, resourcing perspective. We've built some muscle here to be more dynamic than ever before. I think presents us in lines us up in a way, should that then start to happen in the second half. So, I certainly take the point, I think, if you could see it at our level, you'd see kind of technology and major platform and customers sort of arrayed on a grid that is the way that our teams think about it as they just move across quarter-to-quarter. Deane Dray : That's really helpful. One question that's come up in a couple of calls and discussions that we've had in this market is a question of inventory obsolescence, just because of this pocket that we've been in of a destock as some of the inventory just is obsolete. It probably is not as much of an effect for you all. But is there any issue there and what might the dynamics be? Eric Ashleman : Yeah. I mean, I haven't heard that raised as an internal concern or issue. I'm thinking, a lot of the business we do, let's say in Analytical Instrumentation I mean it's a bit more of a mature space, mature industry maybe not as likely in the short-term, dimension to be obsoleted by major steps in technology, but I can add it there. That hasn't been something that we've talked a lot about. Deane Dray : Good that would be my impression as well. And then just separately just because it's a good time of year to look at that very near-term crystal ball that you have. All of your bellwether businesses collectively, whether it's Band-It or gas or Warren Rupp, just what is the kind of the cadence of demand that you're seeing in your day rates versus your expectations? Eric Ashleman : Yeah. That's one of the healthiest indicators that we have here. Just for everybody on the call, again, these are the shortest cycle more sort of widely dispersed businesses that we have with the most fragmented customer sets. And so when they move they tend to indicate, where the world is going either way. When they move together they strongly indicate where the world is going and, we saw them move together, back at the original zones of recalibration here as they move down. And in Q4 and certainly continuing here in January, they are all moving together towards the positive. These are modest rates, but a simple green arrow next to all of those names across IDEX, is meaningful and supports a lot of the confidence that we have. Deane Dray : That sounds great. Because we look at those and it's coincident with some of the better indicators we've seen from the ISM new orders. So I'm glad it's consistent. And that's it. Thank you. Abhi Khandelwal : Thanks you, Deane. Operator : The next question is from the line of Vlad Bystricky with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions. Vlad Bystricky : Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my call and thanks for all the great information. Just quickly, and sorry if I missed it, did you say what price cost actually was in the quarter and what you're assuming for price cost in '24 as well as your overall price assumptions in the 0% to 2% organic growth outlook? Abhi Khandelwal : Yeah. Absolutely, Vlad. This is Abhi. So firstly, for the fourth quarter, we saw pricing around 4%. It was definitely start-- we definitely start to see it come down as the year progress, so a few quarters later compared to the, prior quarters, but it's closer to 4%. As I think about 2024 what we're modeling is a 2%, price in the guide. But what we're more focused on is the price cost spread. As I think about the price-cost spread it's in the, 80 basis points to 100 basis points, which is again it's higher than the historical averages IDEX has seen. And even the 2% price capture, if you go back in time and look at the IDEX historical pre-pandemic was in the 80 to 100 basis point, 120 basis points. So that's what we've modeled in the guide. Vlad Bystricky : Perfect. That's really helpful. Thanks, Abhi. And then I just wanted to ask you a little more-- Slide 10 is very helpful color around what you're seeing in businesses and the end markets. Can you talk a little more about what you're seeing with respect to energy transition-related demand. Kind of particular project types that are seeing a pickup or driving that and whether you're seeing it across regions or more pronounced in any particular geographies. Eric Ashleman : Yeah. I'll take a shot at that and of course, it always go through a bit of an IDEX filters. So we're a couple of derivatives away from what you might notice is a headline. So think of this as almost any technology that's involved in, kind of the transition from traditional energy to alternate sources and emerging sustainable sources. And we see that in places like battery manufacturing. We don't make the batteries but we do a lot of the work around material handling because it's pretty nasty caustic material. And so we've seen really, really nice velocity there and continuing into '24 on things supporting kind of all the work that goes on for switch-over to battery tech. Even some of the businesses that we have in FMT that have a little bit of mining exposure have been strong for a while, they continue strong and of course, it's tied to the mineral extraction that goes with that. One of our recent acquisitions on the Airtech side and that business ever since it came and was a part of IDEX, one of its strongest catalyst has been alternative energy solutions where we do some of the thermal management that happens inside. So it's, again, we're kind of in the box, with our high-tech components and we're doing very, very critical jobs and we're doing them a little far away from the headlines, but you can absolutely see the lines coming right back into that industry. You asked about geographic spread. I wouldn't say there's I mean, we have projects in Europe. Some of them ultimately land in Asia. So it's pretty uniform across the globe. But again, we're hitting it in these niche verticals and niche applications. Vlad Bystricky : Great. That's really helpful color. I appreciate it. Thanks. Abhi Khandelwal : Thanks, Vlad. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question. Rob Wertheimer : Thanks. So my question is going to be on HST, Life Sciences within it and how you manage costs and I guess there's a kind of a specific one, to your question on how the financials may play out and then just a larger question on philosophy on how you manage the business. Is the cost structure currently set such that if demand does come back, and you see above-normal incrementals you kind of return towards historical margin levels? I mean that's kind of the first one, do you kind of prime for return would cost come back. And then the second question is more just how do you think about cutting cost when businesses turn down? Obviously nobody has a crystal ball, we can't see what happens in two years. If you'd known how deep this downturn would have been would you have managed the business any differently or not? Thanks. Abhi Khandelwal : Well, look. Thanks for the questions. So as I think about where we've been over the last couple of years as just good operators, good business cadence, we've been looking at our cost structure, you can see in our financials where quarter-after-quarter if you look at our restructuring around, right, we've done work in that area. Where we are today from a cost standpoint in our Life Sciences business, because that was the question, we feel comfortable with where we are, given where the volume levels are. To your point, as the volumes start to turn, the leverage on that is going to be a point where the margin rates are going to expand. As I think about how we're going to be thinking about this business long-term, it is all about, balancing our cost structure in a way where it physically volume levels. We don't have any specific plans today to take any more cost out. Eric Ashleman : But I think coming back to, kind of how we manage it and maybe then applying some hindsight in whether or not we would have done a different. I mean, I would put the same for all IDEX businesses, that the places where we've the most careful are areas of domain expertise, technical know-how and, customer relationships. We're really, really careful with those. Because look at these programs and the lifecycle in these risk-averse areas they only change and come around so often even when it's in a market as dynamic as this one. And so if you're not staffed and ready to go. And I use my comments earlier here about, this might seem like a counter-intuitive part of the cycle where business is down, we're wondering when it's going to recover, and yet the innovation moves are actually really active. And again maybe counter intuitively because customers are struggling with some maybe potentially their own resource allocation abilities. That actually dials in quite favorably to our ability to help solve problems with our people. And so think of that is like a very solid core that's sort of under-glass and we're very, very careful about going near it. Labor obviously labor markets have eased up a bit. Frankly, it's easier to flex them and so some of what Abhi is talking about under the year we've made those moves. We've taken variable resources out that can be brought back in we think quite easily should we need to go up, but that technical core kind of remains. The other thing that we leverage really, really well at IDEX and I think do it quite intuitively as frankly when we look at our leaders. All of our leaders are kind of ready when they need comes to be able to go do more, because they're really-- we have a flat organizational structure and we're close to the point of impact anyways. And so, avoidance is actually a big thing, cost avoidance and holding back additions. We are actually able to flex that muscle a lot more than most companies. And so when, environments are here and we're starting to see the early signs we can sort of be really careful and hold back because we've got the deployment plans that allows very smart people to get close to the action and step in. So, I think it's those two things working around frankly a labor environment that's healthier for some of that flexing that you just would want to do. All of which says that in the early days of demand run up back to Abhi's points on margin expansion, we always perform very well as we're coming out of a period like this for all of these reasons. The leverage is kind of its highest point. Rob Wertheimer : Perfect. Thank you for the mini-education there Eric and I look forward to meeting you Abhi. Thanks. Abhi Khandelwal : Same here. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. Brett Linzey : Hey. Good morning, all. Abhi Khandelwal : Good morning, Brett. Brett Linzey : Hey. Just wanted to come back to the, distribution MRO and some of the stabilization you're seeing there, good to see. Just curious, on the other side around CapEx and planning assumptions among your customers. Has the tone changed in terms of capital outlays and things of that nature and what are you expecting in those types of businesses for the year? Eric Ashleman : Yeah. I mean, you kind of see that large project work and large capital in primarily in our water business to some degree you see it, of course, that's municipal capital, be it in energy, a little bit in pharma. So I mean, in those zones, I would say it's early days and modest, but it is positive. So these would be small expansion opportunities or projects that they've been talking about for a while that they want to now start to get moving. I don't know that in many of them I would say you're at the, kind of mega project level or we're ready to go, or it's been sanctioned, but to be fair, that's the usual step-up when things get more positive. So we are hearing some good indications, from a variety of different markets, about more intentional capital deployment. Not yet at the levels of kind of full-cycle supporting multi-quarter or even year in duration, but good early signs that it's actually quite different than what we saw in a lot of 2023. Brett Linzey : Okay. Got it. And then just one last one on the margin outlook for this year. So 28% EBITDA margins, I was hoping you might be able to provide a little bit of context and dimension to the segment levels. FMT, specifically, I'm interested with that, softer, but how are you thinking about the, outlook for the segments around that 28%? Abhi Khandelwal : Yeah, absolutely. I can do that for you. So as you saw in our guide for '24 for the company is 28%. So if you think about HST, I think as we exit the year, you're going to start to see our margins come closer to 30%, as the volumes flexes back up in the back half of the year. On the FMT side, you should expect slight bit of margin expansion on top of what you saw in 2023. And about the FSDP side, you should expect to see slight margin erosion due to the, completion of the big-box retailer refresh cycle, which puts some mix pressure on the margin line But again, HST you should see expansion, FMT slight bit of expansion and FSD a little bit of contraction, tied to dispensing. Brett Linzey : Got it. Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your questions. Jeff Sprague : Thank you good morning everyone. A lot covered here, so maybe I'll zoom out and Eric, maybe just a little bit longer-term perspective here. Some talk about, being positioned for the recovery and the like I just wonder your confidence level or your view on sort of normalized organic growth for the company, right? We've come through this tumultuous three years, but looking at it through the lens of kind of, your pre-COVID growth rate 2011 to 2019 was 3% or 4% organic, on average, it sounds like from Abhi's comment, maybe there's another point of price in the future relative what you have. But what is your confidence level that, maybe putting aside kind of a snapback here in 2025 that you're at a higher level of organic growth going forward on a normalized basis? Eric Ashleman : Yeah. Well, I appreciate the question and that's absolutely where we're heading. And so think of this as two levers primarily that we're moving. One is just the nature of the portfolio of IDEX. So, we've been more aggressive towards capital deployment. Everything we're bringing into IDEX today is inherently in faster-growing markets than, let's say, more of the industrial core that we see, most notably in FMT. So, the comparative basis that's tuning. We haven't done a lot of pruning on the other side, it's fairly modest. But to the extent we're doing it, that's actually moving that portfolio average up as well. And then, if with reasonable market support sort of absent massive swings of either way, as you suggested, I think we've long been targeting 200 basis points to 300 basis points of outperformance and everything we're working on today is moving that towards the upper bound of that run-out. So if you think of a world that let's say would start to dial itself in more from a fundamental perspective towards something in the 2% to 3% range and sort of natural entitlement. And maybe that's lifting from there because of the work that we're doing, as I mentioned, and then out performance above it, it has us, moving into a space where we're targeting mid-single-digit growth for IDEX. On an organic basis. With then obviously some, fundamental capital deployment on top of it, which would then extend the overall organic rate of the company. It's absolutely the area of focus, has been for a while and we're really, we're excited about potentially taking out some of the forces that have been swinging up-and-down and sideways making that hard to see. Jeff Sprague : And where do you stand on the view of price, right? You have more than normal still in 2024. There is some argument out there that industrial companies have, developed more price muscle coming through this period. Do you think, there's kind of durable stickiness in the 2% range or do we sort of head back to something more like one over time? Abhi Khandelwal : Well, look, first of all. I think to your point, where the world is we're not back to the inflation levels that we were at, pre-pandemic. I mean even if you look at the near-term view it's still at what 2.5%, 3%. So are we going to hang on to where we are today? No. Does that mean we're going to, go back to where they used to be back in the historical levels? No, it's going to be somewhere in the middle. But looking at 2024, we feel pretty good about our position and where we are from a price cost standpoint. Eric Ashleman : And, I would say, here, I think this is a point of absolute point of competitive advantage for us, where price capture, we've always been in the price capture game. And we've done that because of our positioning and our innovation with great customers. Period. So, yes, we've come through a phase here where kind of everybody got price, because you had to. But, I think as the world normalizes here as Abhi says we'll probably land a little north of where we've been, as long as the underlying, core inflation stays a little harder too. So we'll maintain the spread that you'd expect. But I'm really proud and I think we will be noticed to be noticeably differentiated because of this core capability that we have to differentiate in sticky markets with risk-averse customers that reward us when we do our job well. Jeff Sprague : Thanks. And just one other quick one. What percent of your total Life Sciences and Analytical is in China at this point? Eric Ashleman : I mean, we don't have a lot of direct business there, we're kind of following customers. So it's closer-- a better ratio would be what percentage of their business is in China, which is-- I mean it's a fraction. It's less than 20% plus or minus depending on the sector that we're involved with. But again that's-- it's kind of an indirect vectoring for us there. We don't have a lot of feet on the ground there in a direct way. Jeff Sprague : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with BNP. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Buscaglia : Hey. Good morning, guys. Abhi Khandelwal : Hey, Andrew. Andrew Buscaglia : Just wanted to -- on Slide 10, you gave a great breakdown of kind of where you're thinking things shake out, where they're going by end-market. I'm wondering HST, margins really kind of struggled towards the end of the year there. That Life Sciences and Analytical Instrumentation piece, how do we think about it from a mix standpoint because you mentioned mix a few times, I imagine if that were to come back this year that could be a nice bonus for your margins. Abhi Khandelwal : Yeah. Just so I make myself clear. The mix that we were talking about was the mix of the dispensing business causing pressure in 2024 since the refresh cycle with the big-box retailers were over. But to go back to your question, if I think about the Life Sciences business and think about volumes coming back, I think as Eric mentioned just where we are positioned on our cost structure as the business has come back and we still see a little help from volume, you should see our margins expand in our HST segment throughout the year. Andrew Buscaglia : Okay. In FMT, I thought that was surprising the growth you saw this quarter. How much is attributed to really like some of the government stimulus you're seeing? And is that where some of your confidence is coming in '24? Eric Ashleman : I mean, that's out there to some extent, it's probably most directly linked to spaces like water within it. But that's a small part of the overall segment. It's an indirect relationship for us. So to the extent that is one of the elements that's out there as a backstop, providing some confidence. Yes, it of course correlates. I would say more generally, for me this is it's just a healthier view from a number of folks that think it's time to be confident, lean into their markets, stop reaping inventory out of the system and kind of get to work. Again, just to make sure everybody can 3D think this through. So they're building a lot of roads out there. I'll use that as an example, or if they're starting to fix them with abandon. We've got a lot of pumps and things that are involved in pumping liquid asphalt. So that's kind of a nature of some of these relationships. So you can line up both government-intensive work that's supported that way as well as just general industrial are people feeling confident about the work that they're doing in their factories. Either one and taken together drive this dynamic. Andrew Buscaglia : Yeah. All right. Thanks for the color. Eric Ashleman : Yeah. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Joe Giordano with TD, Cowen. Please proceed with your questions. Joe Giordano : Hey, guys. Thanks for sneaking me in here. I had a question on HST just on the revenue guide. I was a little surprised at the strength there and I know you guys don't guide to orders, specifically. But if you just kind of hold orders around the fourth-quarter level, maybe a little bit above into the 2024 and just run off the excess orders that were done like post-COVID when book-to-bill was really high it kind of implies like a decent decline next year. So, I was curious if you're contemplating, in order of recovery of more magnitude in 2024 for HST? Abhi Khandelwal : Yeah. So if I kind of think about the guide for the year and look at the order-- sequential order run up from Q3 to Q4, as you mentioned. First of all, the uptick in orders of $30 million from Q3 to Q4 $10 million of that was blanket orders. That's going to ship throughout 2024 and $20 million of debt was through demand or sequential improvement that we saw throughout the quarter. That said, as I think about 2024, we do expect to build or build the orders up as we go throughout the year. As Eric mentioned, we are being cautious, given where we are seeing early signs of recovery in the different parts of HST. So as you think about the order profile and think about the balance of the year, we expect to continue to build that order book up and ship that throughout the year. Eric Ashleman : And then just a reminder that, again, about half the segment is pretty industrial in nature, so it kind of mirrors a lot of the other comments that we've had many of them around FMT businesses, but you get about half of that, driving and supporting HST as well. Joe Giordano : Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session and I will turn the call over to Eric Ashleman for closing remarks. Eric Ashleman : Okay. Well, thanks everyone on the call for your questions and the interest in IDEX. Abhi, thanks for joining and coming to your first earnings call with me. Just a few things here. I mean, number one, we realize from the outside, IDEX is a complex and diversified company. And it hasn't helped that we've had a lot of, swings in some of the larger markets of the company, both up-and-down over the last couple of years. So, we've done our best to work through that with you and help you understand where we are. I think right now that we're actually in a place where things are a lot clearer than they've been in a while. Certainly, one of our key messages here is we've hit a uniform market stability, we hit that last fall and we really enjoyed Q4 and being having a chance to take a breath and get lined up here for the beginnings of what we think will be a great cycle. The vast majority of our end markets are starting to see a return to growth, as we said and I think that point around the shorter cycle business is starting to move together. That has always been a very reliable proxy for us in the company. Early days, but we've seen that, we've now seen it reinforced in January. And I remind people that as we've tuned IDEX and tuned it to the kind of companies that we brought in that are faster-growing closer to really, really strong OEMs, it drives a series of bets and initiatives across the company where the unit measure is a little bit larger. We're working to execute that and laying that on a foundation as we go. The fundamental piece of the story here is, we have confidence in accelerating through the year. The Life Sciences and Analytical Instrumentation world, it is uncertain for 2024. But I do want to come back and just echo some comments I've made before about just our commitment to that space and are confident in the long-term fundamental performance that we're all going to enjoy there and our positioning is fantastic. We see that evidenced by the innovation that we're being asked to do. And finally, we put a lot of capital to work over the last three years with real intentionality in some pretty choppy seas. And so if things are going to calm down and we'll get some more winds at our back, I'm really, really confident we'll be able to push that further, and continue to do that work and continue to transform the company. So thanks again for joining. Have a great day. Operator : This will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect your lines at this time.",

It is now my pleasure to introduce Wendy Palacios, Vice President, FP&A and Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Wendy Palacios : Good morning, everyone. This is Wendy Palacios, Vice President of FP&A and Investor Relations for IDEX Corporation. Thank you for joining us for our discussion of the IDEX First Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights.  Last night, we issued a press release outlining our company's financial operating performance for the 3 months ending March 31, 2024. The press release, along with the presentation slides to be used during today's webcast, can be accessed on our company's website at www.idexcorp.com. Joining me today are Eric Ashleman, our Chief Executive Officer and President; and Abhi Khandelwal, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. [Operator Instructions] If you should need to exit the call for any reason, you may access a complete replay beginning approximately 2 hours after the call concludes by dialing the toll free number (877) 660-6853 and entering conference ID# 13742103, or simply log on to our company homepage for the webcast replay.  Before we begin, a brief reminder. This call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbor language in last night's press release and in IDEX filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  With that, I'll turn this call over to our CEO and President, Eric Ashleman. Eric Ashleman : Thanks, Wendy, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 3. In Q1, our core execution capabilities delivered strong results, particularly within our Fluid & Metering Technologies and Fire & Safety/Diversified Products businesses. We experienced an encouraging lift in sequential orders from our core industrial and municipal markets after a period of elongated destocking, and we were able to quickly capitalize on this bounce and deliver for our customers.  Our lead times and overall responsiveness are at outstanding levels as we stripped out excess inventory and improved overall productivity. Our closest to consumption businesses within FMT pulled back a bit in March after a strong January and February launch, but things stabilized again in early April, suggesting our initial take on overall modest report for 2024 remains the correct call. The Health & Science Technologies segment performed at expectations, but there are puts and takes there as we consider individual recovery rates within our markets and application sets. Our tactical priorities favor those growth initiatives that best leverage our most differentiated technologies in line with markets showing higher probabilities of near-term inflection. Largely through inorganic efforts, we've expanded our technical capabilities within HST to support the Highest Quality Semiconductor technologies to power the AI revolution. We have increased content within the transformative world of low orbit space broadband, we are increasingly called upon to help companies develop and deploy advanced technologies for national defense and we have ambitions to continue to add to these capabilities as we further leverage our balance sheet through M&A. We continue to watch for signs of recovery in life sciences and analytical instrumentation and are ready to capitalize on growth at the first signs of improving customer demand. Our businesses serving these spaces are exceptionally well positioned with highly credible expertise. We have confidence in our ability to outperform again once this market correction runs its course.  Overall, it's clear that economic and geopolitical uncertainty persist as a backdrop for all companies. We've leaned into that with conviction that the three core tenets of the IDEX difference, an expression of our most basic differentiated mindset help us play offense. Our great teams and talent work together in superior businesses with a special culture. We practice 80-20 to align around the few things that really matter and we leverage natural proximity to the customer to solve their toughest problems quickly to support our outstanding economics. We ultimately create compounding value for shareholders by driving organic growth outperformance through our top growth bets.  We amplify these bets through acquisition of complementary faster-growing companies and we expand margins and generate strong free cash along the way as our leaders apply the five core tools of the IDEX operating model. I'd like to thank our IDEX teams around the globe for their dedication to these principles and for delivering strong performance in Q1. With that, I'll turn it over to Abhi to discuss our financial results. Abhishek Khandelwal : Thanks, Eric. Before jumping into the consolidated results on Slide 4, I want to highlight our team's consistent ability to execute, as you've seen in the results, delivering strong profitability and free cash flow in the first quarter despite challenging year-over-year comparables.  Moving on to the consolidated financial results. All comparisons are against the prior year period unless stated otherwise. Quarters of $820 million in the first quarter were down both 1% overall organically. We experienced an organic decrease in FMT and HST, while FSDP grew low double digits, driven by strength in dispensing and emerging markets. First quarter sales of $801 million were down 5% overall and down 6% organically. We experienced a 13% organic decrease in HST and a 3% organic decrease in FMT, while FSDP grew by 2% organically.  First quarter gross margin was 44.6%, declining 60 basis points, while adjusted gross margin was 45%, contracting 20 basis points due to volume leverage, partially offset by price/cost and operational productivity. First quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 26%, down 120 basis points. This is a sequential improvement versus fourth quarter of 20 basis points as we remain focused on margin expansion. I will discuss the drivers of first quarter adjusted EBITDA on the next slide.  On a GAAP basis, our Q1 effective tax rate of 21.5% versus last year's first quarter effective tax of 22.2% decreased primarily due to a favorable discrete item. First quarter net income was $121 million, generating EPS of $1.60. Adjusted net income was $143 million with adjusted EPS of $1.88, down $0.21 from the prior year first quarter. Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $137 million, up 13% over the prior year period. We achieved a conversion rate of 95% of adjusted net income, mainly driven by lower variable compensation payments and capital expenditures despite lower adjusted net income. On an organic basis, we drove more than $78 million of inventory reduction over the last 12 months, and we saw inventory turns improve 0.4 turn year-over-year.  Slide 5. Moving on to Slide 5, which details the driver of our first quarter adjusted EBITDA. For the first quarter, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $22 million compared to the first quarter of 2023. Our 6% organic sales reduction unfavorably impacted adjusted EBITDA by $29 million flowing through at our prior year adjusted gross margin rate. Price/cost was accretive to margins and we drove operational productivity that offset employee-related inflation. These results yielded in a negative 50% organic flow through. The impact of FX and acquisitions net of divestitures contributed $3 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter, resulting in a negative 48% flow-through.  With that, I'll provide a deeper look at our segment performance. I'm on Slide 6, within our FMT segment. In our water businesses, municipal project activity remains strong. Note that water sales performance in first quarter of the prior year was favorably impacted by both Hurricane-related backlog execution and the catch-up of a 1-month lag treatment of the Nexsight acquisition effectively recording 4 months of Nexsight sales in the first quarter of 2023. Our energy businesses remained stable with favorable infrastructure tailwinds, offset by a mild winter. Our agricultural businesses continue to be cyclically down, in line with expectations. Finally, Q1 adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 60 basis points, driven by price/cost and operational productivity despite slightly lower volumes.  Moving on to Page 7. Despite challenging year-over-year comparables, the Health & Science Technologies segment performed to expectations, and nearly all of our HST business saw sequential orders improvement as compared to the fourth quarter. Our teams continued focusing on our most strategic customers' next-gen solutions in life sciences and analytical instrumentation while we watch for signs of recovery. Our space, broadband and laser communication initiatives continue on track despite current quarter customer delays. Our material processing technology business saw strength in food and sports nutrition that offset conservative customer capital investments within biopharma and pharma. For semiconductor, we saw orders improvement, both year-over-year and compared to the fourth quarter. And we expect these trends to continue in line with an improved outlook for memory chips. In line with our FMT industrial businesses, the HST industrials are steady. Lastly, adjusted EBITDA margins improved 40 basis points over the fourth quarter of last year. A year-over-year decline of 250 basis points was driven by volume leverage, partially offset by price/cost and operational productivity.  Now turning to Slide 8. Our Fire & Safety/Diversified Products segment performance was driven by dispensing project wins in emerging markets, which helped offset the impact of key U.S. customers' multiyear refreshment cycle. We continue to see stability in Fire & Safety. In the quarter, our focus on strategic share gain initiatives helped partially offset unfavorable budget reallocations in the industry.  BAND-IT automotive demand is strong with growth expected in the year. Additionally, industrial performance was similar to FMT and HST with sequential improvement versus Q4. Finally, adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 40 basis points, driven by price/cost.  With that, I'd like to provide an update on our outlook for the second quarter. I'm on Slide 9. In Q2, we're projecting GAAP EPS to range from $1.75 to $1.80 and adjusted EPS to range from $2 to $2.05, with organic revenue decline of approximately 2% to 3% and adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 27.5%.  Turning to the full year 2024. We are maintaining our previously issued full-year outlook of organic revenue growth of 0% to 2% and adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 28% and adjusted EPS of $8.15 to $8.45 with majority of markets performing in line with our initial guidance and our focused efforts on driving growth bets.  With that, I'll turn it over to Eric for his closing remarks. Eric Ashleman : Thanks, Abhi. I'm on Slide 10. I'd like to close by coming back to the simple value equation I talked about in my opening remarks. It all starts with organic growth outperformance, typically targeting 300 basis points above market entitlements. We drive about 20 to 25 bps across the company at any one time to achieve these results. I highlighted earlier some examples of growth initiatives through Applied Technologies within HST. Within FMT, we're also working on integrating the recently acquired assets within our Intelligent water group alongside our legacy technologies to support critical analytical work within municipal and industrial wastewater containment and processing. Also within FMT, we're deploying digital tools across multiple brands that go to market through distribution to enhance our customer experience and promote share gain. I'll go deeper in the quarters ahead with additional specific examples to help bring this work to life.  We amplify these bets with complementary inorganic work via M&A to add another 200 to 300 basis points of growth. We see an outstanding opportunity to support faster-growing transformational markets through the disciplined build of relative and absolute scale within very high-quality niches. Over the last 3 years, we've been working this play in the intelligent water space within thin-film optics and within the niche of small form factor materials-intensive processing.  Finally, we expand margins and seek to drive double-digit earnings growth along the way as our teams deploy the five basic IDEX operating model tools with 80-20 as our heartbeat. Our decentralized environment and collaborative culture supports speed and agility and our inclination to resist top-heavy infrastructure supports financial leverage as we grow.  In closing, the world is transforming and evolving in exciting, but unpredictable ways. We're building a company that thrive and win in that environment where power meets speed and agility at the intersection of technology and culture. I look forward to communicating our progress with you along the way.  With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Robert W. Baird. Michael Halloran : So just a simple question, Eric. Maybe just talk about, in your mind, if anything has really changed in the market since you gave the last guidance or from an expectation perspective, obviously, dispensing a little better in the first quarter, doesn't seem like your expectations for the remainder of the year are all that different. But when you go through some of the key end markets, has much really changed from an outlook perspective? And how are you thinking about the sequentials through the year versus normal seasonality, ignoring some of the self -- the positive things that you were driving with some of your investments? Eric Ashleman : Yes. No, thanks for the question. I mean not a lot that's different. I mean, I provided some color around the cadence of those kind of smaller flow FMT order of businesses that we have that are such good diagnostics. I think just to show that at the end of the day, the call remains the same, but it was interesting to watch the sensitivity and kind of ebb and flow in a way. It's a little unusual. Hot January and February, a little bit of pullback in March kind of coming back to equilibrium in April. So I think that's interesting mainly because I think it's reflective of the -- frankly, the level of sensitivity that is out there as people track inflation, interest rates, election, but I think we still land at the same place.  When we look at particularly the markets in HST, of course, about half of it is pretty industrial, too. So it kind of follows the same rhythm and cadence. I think what we see is shoots of growth kind of around the periphery of the larger pieces of HST. So our MPT business got some great things going on in terms of food production and our battery material handling, but not necessarily in the core pharma. That's still to come. We saw a little lift in ceiling around some -- kind of coming off the bottom in consignment orders and largely in that kind of memory chip world, but we still await the broader lift on the highest quality semicon offerings that we have in the company. So when you step back, I think kind of broad but modest support on much of the industrial landscape of IDEX and then I think a lot of attention for us back on those kind of two core higher-growth potential markets within HST, life science and analytical instrumentation in the semicon markets and kind of great '25 sitting there, it's just a question of how much in the back half do you start to see some velocity towards it. And that's pretty close to where we were, I think, 3 months ago. Michael Halloran : Yes. No, makes sense. And then an HST margin question. Obviously, you're running well below peak right now. When you get mix normalized and those end markets come back, whether it's '25 or later, back part of this year, as you just mentioned, how do you think about margin normalization? Is that 25% to 27% kind of range you're at towards peak, is that still the bogey for where you think things will be when you get a little more normalization? And maybe just put a little context around that because we're having some moving pieces to that segment. Abhishek Khandelwal : Yes, Mike, this is Abhi. So I think if you go back 90 days and think about the discussion near the end of Q4, I think, look, what we've said is that the volumes come back in HST, more specifically in life sciences and the semicon that Eric just talked about. This business levers really well. And what we have said is we expect margins to be closer to 30% in HST once our volumes are back. Michael Halloran : So 30% EBITDA margins when everything comes back, okay? Because the 25% to 27% just for clarity, was me just previous margin ranges. So okay, that makes sense. That makes sense. We appreciate everyone. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Eric, I think you've given some of the color here, but just regarding your read on how the year is beginning to play out, can you also touch on day rates and it sounded like BAND-IT started off well, so that's always a good sign. And anything else about the bellwethers, Warren Rupp and some of the others? Eric Ashleman : Yes. And that cadence that I articulated in the opening in Mike's question was really right there. It was on those bellwether businesses that we aggregate, take a look at weekly and then kind of use as an ultimate barometer of industrial health for IDEX. And I think, again, we saw those launching really strong in January, continued into February. It was interesting, a little bit of a pullback in March, and we had Easter earlier than ever before. So probably some of it.  But to kind of see that swing and see it as broadly too certainly caught our attention, and yet then it's sort of stabilized again in April. So it's moving a little faster, both directions, than it typically has, and yet the arrow still remains kind of at the exact same slope that we thought. I just want to point it out because, again, I think it's reflective of some of the dialogue and conversations we're having, and this is higher up the food chain around projects, confidence, and where we are. It does seem more sensitive than I've seen in a long time to kind of whatever's on the news and what's out there, which isn't really surprising given kind of what this year is and where we are. So largely an unchanged position, but I thought the color might be helpful. Abhishek Khandelwal : And just to build on it, I think the other thing it points to that we've had a lot of conversations around is normalization of the supply chain. So it's a lot faster when it turns on, a lot faster when it turns on because people know that the lead times are back to normal levels that they can adjust their demand as they see the markets move up and down. Deane Dray : That's real helpful. And I'm glad you mentioned about that normalization of supply chain because that's been a focus. And just a separate question on the life sciences, analytical instruments market. We've been watching this and just kind of waiting where and how that -- the destocking might run its course and it just really hasn't turned the corner yet. I did see one of the life science guys report a strong quarter, but that was more on the bio processing side, less on the instrument side.  But what's the typical lag between what you see from the OEs in terms of their sales of instruments versus your supply of these components? I mean, I guess, some of it has to do what their inventory levels are and whether they're running off their current stock and then whether they're pulling from -- to you for their orders. But just the typical lag and any color there would be helpful. Eric Ashleman : Yes. So I think there's a couple of points to hit there. I'll start with the first where you ended. I mean the lag is -- I mean it's not extended for us because most of our replenished cycles and lead time fulfillment abilities and capabilities of components going to companies like that is really fast. I mean it's one of the reasons that when this sort of destocking cycle started, we were one of the first to come and recognize it back in Q4 of '22. And so I think any sign of life, we're going to see that first and it's -- and we're going to see it probably pretty close to the time that they're talking about selling the instruments just because of the natural way that forecast would roll in and come back into our factories.  We -- typically, this is for most cases, I mean, we're not requiring months and quarters of heads up on that just because we're set up to quick turn most of the components. I think maybe the only exception would be, look, if there's a material shift in the overall demand profile, then we've got to think about making sure that we get those same broader signals out to our suppliers and they do that with us. You have to have that conversation, but sort of the early turn in inflection would be relatively quickly aligned. The only other point kind of embedded in the earlier part of your question to come back to is just as we're all reading signals from the broader market, as you're thinking of IDEX, it's always important to recognize, we participate in the instrument side of those sales. And often, you'll see people are talking about consumable streams. And maybe those would tend to advance and start to move ahead of instruments. And so it's an interesting point, but you always have to kind of equate it back to and what's the velocity on instruments because ultimately, that's where the components that we supply go. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vlad Bystricky with Citigroup. Vladimir Bystricky : I guess can you just talk about, and sorry if I missed it, what price versus cost overall actually was in the quarter and your expectations for price versus cost for the year and what you're seeing in terms of inflationary pressures versus your expectations coming into the year? Abhishek Khandelwal : Yes, Vlad. This is Abhi and I'm more than happy to answer that for you. So if you recall, when we talked about our Q4 earnings, what we talked about was price for 2024, we'd laid it out at about 2%. But more importantly, what we were focused on was this price/cost spread of 80 to 100 basis points. So as you think about where we exited Q1, we were closer to that 100% from a price/cost standpoint, in line with expectations, in fact, on the high end of expectations. If you go back in time and just look at IDEX historically, we've seen from a pricing standpoint is something in the neighborhood of 80 to 1.2 -- or 0.8% to 1.2%. So this pricing that we have laid out '24 is higher than normal levels. And then the price/cost spread typically, what we've seen historically is 30 to 40 bps versus what we're seeing here, which is 80 to 100 bps. To answer your second question on inflation, what we're seeing is the input cost slightly favorable compared to what we had assumed in the guide that we had laid out as part of the Q4 discussion. Vladimir Bystricky : Great. That's helpful color. I appreciate it. And then just to go back to HST. In terms of the organic sales decline that we've seen in the quarter, are you able to give us more color on the underlying growth rates in industrial and semicon versus what you're seeing in life sciences and analytical instrumentation? Eric Ashleman : Well, a couple of things there. I mean, the comparisons in a lot of HST are at pretty exaggerated levels given the rapid destocking that we saw last year. And so let's -- we've been talking about life science and analytical instrumentation as being in a general condition of kind of flat waiting for signs of recovery. And that, just from a segment percentage, is just over 1/3 of the entire segment.  I think semicon, certainly has high single-digit growth potential, and we're starting to see some early signs. I mentioned some things in ceiling and a couple of other places, but really have a little bit more of that dialed in, in the back half as we start to kind of approach that entitlement. It's probably '25 though, before it really comes in at that full level.  In the industrial space, we kind of talked about, it tracks with generally what we're saying about FMT and much of FSDP, overall. So it's more modest in the low single-digit range right now. And I don't know, Abhi, do you want to add something there? Abhishek Khandelwal : Yes. No, the only thing I'd add is I think just -- look, we've talked about this, I think comparing it year-over-year is kind of tricky given what we saw last year. So I think it's important to kind of point out, if I look at the sequential order trends, look at the sequential order patterns from Q4 to Q1, we saw about $59 million of order uptick, $14 million of that was tied to FSDP, half of that, I'd say is blanket with our large customers that give us blanket that we ship throughout 2024. The other half is normal book-to-bill. You look at FMT, we're up about $28 million in orders sequentially. Again, half true demand that we've about tied to our bellwether businesses and the other half being blanket. And lastly, FSDP is the story around emerging markets and the growth coming out of India, that's really exciting for us. So you saw that sequentially.  So again, I think the key here, the focus here is to look at it sequentially because I think that's a better way to look at the business given where we are in the cycle. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Nathan Jones : Getting back on to the HST order patterns and the sequential improvement that you're seeing there. It's obviously up quite a lot off the bottom from third quarter of '23. Customers did a lot of inventory destocking out of some of those businesses. Is it your view that customer inventories have been rightsized and we're kind of moving back to an area where your orders are pretty close to what your end customers are selling? Or is that still continued destocking going on from your customers? And do you have visibility into that? Eric Ashleman : Well, so I'll kind of break down HST because I think the answer varies a bit depending on the portion-ality of the pieces. So half of it is broadly industrial, again, more like FMT and the rest of IDEX. And I think they're -- like in those other areas, I'd say the destocking trends are largely past us. And so part of that lift you're seeing in that industrial core. And it's because, frankly, we're at about the levels of consumption and as those become more positive, we rise with them. So you see the same dynamic in about half of HST that you see elsewhere. I think in the other areas, it's a little trickier and the visibility, to be fair, is a little bit murkier because of just the extension of those supply chains. So now in life science and analytical instrumentation, of course, we can best see inventory between us and factories. And ultimately, that cleared very fast for us, so I don't see an inventory accumulation there.  End devices, which, of course, have global reach, harder for us to see. We ask about it all the time and there probably are pockets here and there of different platforms and things that are out there that we're probably still working through. So I'd say there may be some moderate or minor effect there, but they're just harder to see and they're kind of outside the four walls of where our usual experience is.  And then in semicon, I think it varies as well because there's such discrete and different pieces of semicon. So things associated with memory, as I said, for us, that's kind of simple consignment stock and it's starting to move off the bottom, which would indicate, okay, we cleared that inventory too. Some of the kind of higher tech things at the other end of the spectrum, more anchored towards high-end lithography or metrology. I think -- and quite honestly, we're just waiting -- the entire industry is waiting for a stronger demand catalyst there to get it moving. So figure half of the segment generally clear, looks a lot like industrial IDEX and then I'd say kind of 50-50 and the other half, depending on these two large pieces. Nathan Jones : That's helpful. Maybe back on to the margin question and where it gets back to in a more normalized volume environment, I think you said 30%. Is that -- first, is that an EBITDA margin target? Because historically, we've been talking about operating margins... Abhishek Khandelwal : EBITDA margins item. Nathan Jones : Yes. And I would think that during this downturn, that, that business carries a lot of very highly-skilled labor that you would be really hesitant to rationalize during your downturn, particularly one that's likely to be short and cyclical. And so that's led to some of these pretty high decrementals that you're seeing in that segment. But should all that result in very good operating leverage and very high incrementals as we come out of the other side. Is there any commentary you can give us on kind of what you'd expect to see out of incremental margins in HST as we see that volume adjust? Abhishek Khandelwal : Well, Nathan, I think the point you made is the answer, but I will say it, which is, to your point, we've been very, very thoughtful in terms of how we rightsize the business. Again, as Eric talks about the long-term vision, we believe in the long vision of this business and expect this business to grow as we come out of the cycle.  So as you think about the incrementals on the uptick, I'd say it's 35% to 40% is the incrementals you should expect, if not north of it, depending on the investments we make in the business over the long term as we grow the business. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. Joseph Giordano : Just curious like on the tools and the life science piece of HST, is there like -- medium term, is there any sort of like adjustments at the top end of like what this potential is? I mean I know we're going to get to the end of the destock and all that over the next bit here, and long term there's a clear call. But like do we need to like adjust what we think like the potential is over like a multiyear period here given what's happening internationally and things like that? Eric Ashleman : Well, I think there's probably a couple of things out there to consider at the highest level when you're projecting. I think you hit one of them. So the ultimate position of China in this market, I think is something everybody has to think about. It's a big part of the issue currently because it was such a high catalyst of growth here more recently for most of the customers that we supply. .  And so kind of where that comes out there, as you know, there are some regulatory things that are out there in the mix. I haven't seen a big move in this particular area from any stimulus programs that have been applied over there. So kind of where it ultimately settles in, I think, is an open question.  On the other side, though, probably on the positive and the question of does it offset it, we continue to see just massive technology advancements here. I know the things that we're working on with customers in our building certainly have even potentially higher growth potential as you think of where that may land on a global populations and what work that could get done. So kind of I put the nature of innovation is a positive and where it goes and keeping track of it and seeing what it can all do right next to a question on China is probably the two biggest calls. Joseph Giordano : Would you say like globally, it's longer term fungible? Like there's a baseline global demand that is going up and whether it's China or elsewhere, where this needs to be put in, it needs to be put in and like it's just friction over like a shorter-term basis? Is that how you kind of think about it? Eric Ashleman : I think that's exactly how we would think about it. I mean, it's -- the China piece, in particular, is pronounced from just the relative nature of what it had been and what it is now. And that's not trivial. That's couple of positive years on the one side and a few of adjustment on the other. But long term, this is ultimately about applying life-saving technology, transformational technology, of course, a global population. And I think certainly, one of the things that we always intended with our franchise is having global reach and scale. We have that. So if it begins to shift around and move from one region to another to do the work, that's actually something we're very well set up to align with. So I think that's well stated. It's -- in the near term, it's -- which way are the winds blowing. I think more medium term, it's more regionally around some of these key questions. And long term, it seems very, very assured. And I think it's ultimately about do you have the scale to go chase it, and we do. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Matt Summerville : I wanted maybe just a little bit of commentary and maybe a little bit more granularity on what you're seeing in the M&A pipeline at present, which businesses, which end markets are you focused on have you seen as far as purchase price multiples? Just a little more detailed color there. Eric Ashleman : Yes. Well, I think you saw in the remarks that I had. I mean, I made a special point to talk about the fact that we're looking for complementary pieces. So things that attach well to other areas of IDEX and I mentioned, at high level, how we had done that over the last 3 years in the optics space, the water space. And then I call it kind of material-intensive processing on small form factor, that's where Muon fits and frankly, STC.  So these are businesses that when we purchase them, not only are we purchasing a great IDEX-like business, but we can see attachment points, more natural synergies. And frankly, it matches a vision of something that we're trying to create there, much of which comes back to the question that we just talked about in the life sciences arena of can we have the relative and the absolute scale to do that job well as it globalizes.  And so I think the areas that I highlighted here would be -- you can take those as areas of high interest, and you can see the evidence of things that we've applied there. The valuations, I think we've consistently said for the kind of quality that we look for at IDEX, it remains quite pricey. I will tell you, I think we've put in a lot of work here recently where the capital deployed number for us would be higher if we were willing to go a couple of more turns and meet some of the expectations, and we just did not. We still are very, very disciplined about what we can do with the business. Even in the case where it's complementary like that, they're just -- we know what the limit is. And we've held that line and we'll continue to do that.  So I think one other aspect that I would put is a net positive for us. We continue to find ourselves in proprietary spaces, having conversations with people generally where it's only the two of us. And so that's -- I think that's important in this environment, too. That gives you a bit of a head start.  But the takeaway here is absolutely urgent. I mean we're putting the time in, we're putting the effort in. We are narrower in our focus because we are looking for things that attach well and scale quite naturally within these niches, but -- and we're doing it in a proprietary basis, but we are super careful about where the line needs to end on valuation for us. Matt Summerville : Got it. And then just as a follow-up, could you maybe spend a minute talking about kind of the ultimate duration and strength of the muni water and wastewater cycles as you kind of see it playing out for IDEX? Eric Ashleman : Yes. I think, as I've said a couple of times before, I don't think it launches with a lightning bolt or a bang, but actually, the duration of it is going to be very durable. You've had a lot of intentional funding announcements put out there. Those always take a while to find their way home and funded projects that have been engineered and are now being deployed. So I think what's very positive about this cycle is the -- and I can't think of another one where I've seen this much intentional focus, and frankly, this much unfortunate reinforcement in terms of things in systems that are just not able to cope with the current climate that we have out there. So you put those two things together, and what we know is that level of confidence is what it really takes for engineers and municipalities and industrial spaces to do the work, to make it through the budget cycles, the inevitable number of conversations to get things approved to get them in front of us. The last point I always remind external folks to consider when they think of our water businesses, a lot of what we're doing is analysis. So we're doing infrastructure analysis and then providing that over generally for a technical part of our customer set. And so in that way, we're actually well positioned to kind of -- as a diagnostic at the beginning of the cycle because much of the time, they're using our information and our output to substantiate larger capital projects. And so kind of here in the beginning of a multiyear cycle is a good place for IDEX to be because we're actually helping them put the projects together that's going to extend the cycle, overall. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Robert Wertheimer : Eric, you touched on an interesting topic in your opening comments just on semiconductors and the AI shift, which is obviously driving huge -- in demand, pricing power, all sorts of things, across pockets of industrials. I wonder, do you have any expanded remarks on what your exposure is there, how your technological capabilities are changing, whether you're entering kind of a new segment of semiconductors? Anything you can flesh out there if you're willing. Eric Ashleman : Yes. No, I appreciate it. I mean it's still a modest portion of IDEX, overall, but it's growing, and it's growing and has found its way into the portfolios of some of the things we've recently acquired in HST. So we're certainly more interested and focused on it. And as we've brought those technologies in, I mean, we thought about this revolution and the jobs to do within it, particularly the hardest ones is our #1 area of interest. So we're often going right into lithography instruments and some of the most advanced that are out there because those are the ones that are being called upon to do the work, to create the chip architecture that's going to support the hardest piece of this.  So we're well indexed there. We've long had a metrology portion of our business that's all about validating that, that job was done well. Even on the piece within water that we have that's somewhat semi-focused, I mean it's absolute critical water purification, delivery and heating. And we talked about that in our sustainability report as one of the best eco-friendly solutions we have in the whole company. And so it's a broad market. It's fragmented and segmented into different uses and technologies. But you can think of us as generally thinking about what are the hardest jobs to do that provide the most critical differentiation when they are done because typically, for us, that's where the most economic benefit comes from. And so we're tracking a lot of that -- those different trends, the size of chips, the way that they're being packaged and looking for all the ways that we can play there. So just think of that as that's how we're indexed, that's increasing. And so ultimately, as that plays out, I think we're very, very well positioned. Operator : There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks. Eric Ashleman : Well, thank you very much. Thanks for everybody joining today. We appreciate your interest in IDEX. And look, I think, no doubt, there's some uncertainties out there in the near term whether it's inflation, interest rates, geopolitical tensions, it's obviously an election year. We hear a lot of chatter about that out in the background. As I said, I think there's some sensitivity to it. But more broadly, I still think the arrows are very positive for businesses like ours and others over time. As we're tracking all that, we think it's helpful to provide that color to you as we do it. And as you know, we were very good at moving resources around from here to there within this high-quality portfolio to continue to execute for shareholders and customers.  But I really step back and say, I think we're incredibly positioned for where things are going in the long term. We've had that discussion here with life science and analytical instrumentation, how powerful that's going to be over time. We just had it here more recently with our discussion around semicon and the revolutionary aspects of AI and the part we play there. And then we could go through a host of other applications, more of the niche than not, and take you through that as well. And that's what we're building each and every day through our own organic efforts and the -- efforts of the company.  And so we're laser-focused on the things that matter, both short term and long term and look forward to continuing to talk with you along the way and the quarters to come. Have a great day. Abhishek Khandelwal : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello, and welcome to the IDEX Corporation Q2 2024 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Wendy Palacios, Vice President, Investor Relations, FP&A. Wendy, please go ahead. Wendy Palacios : Good morning, everyone. This is Wendy Palacios, Vice President of FP&A and Investor Relations for IDEX Corporation. Thank you for joining us for our discussion of the IDEX second quarter 2024 financial highlights. Last night, we issued a press release outlining our company's financial and operating performance for the three months ending June 30th, 2024. The press release, along with the presentation to be used during today's webcast, can be accessed at our investor website at investor.idexcorp.com. Joining me today are Eric Ashleman, our Chief Executive Officer and President; and Abhi Khandelwal, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call up for your questions. Turning to Slide 2. Please note that during today's call, we will present certain non-GAAP financial measures. We will also make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding events or developments that we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today, and we do not assume any obligation to update that. Information regarding these factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements is available on our website and our SEC filings. With that, I'll now turn this call over to CEO and President, Eric Ashleman. Eric Ashleman : Thanks, Wendy and good morning everyone. I'm on Slide 3. IDEX delivered against expectations in Q2 despite increasing macro uncertainty, with both adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted EPS coming in slightly above our previous guidance. I'd like to thank the IDEX teams around the world for their strong execution on behalf of our customers and shareholders. As mentioned on our first quarter call, we saw a noticeable uptick in industrial day rates in our closest to consumption FMT businesses in December. This continued through the end of February, but pulled back a bit in March as a surprisingly firm inflation report reduced the likelihood of near-term interest rate relief. These daily order rates are largely stable now and in line with our original 2024 assumptions. However, as the U.S. election cycle has come into full daily view, creating even more uncertainty given the perceived disparity of outcomes, we've seen a pullback in project commitments. There's no talk of project cancellation, just a quarter or two push to the right. We'll continue to watch these businesses as open economic and political questions are resolved for any early signs of inflection. Within the HST segment, we don't yet have enough growth catalysts to overcome the pressures facing our life science and analytical instrumentation markets. Our HST industrial markets are performing as described earlier for FMT, with stable day rates and preferred -- deferred project activity. Despite some encouraging discussions from our semiconductor customers asking us to get ready to launch, to support the next cycle of growth, we just haven't seen yet turn into accelerating releases or increased order positions. We think we're close here as most major players are pointing to likely strong growth in 2025. Life sciences and analytical instrumentation performed in line with expectations, with a strong focus on innovations to support the next cycle of growth and excellent productivity to support margins as we await market recovery. As we said at the beginning of the year, we believe we are unlikely to see positive inflection for these markets, until 2025. FSDP had a strong quarter. Our dispensing teams are performing exceptionally well within emerging markets. Their share gains within India are nicely offsetting much of the pressure from their North American markets, as large retailers step back following a strong two-year replenishment cycle. Our Fire business continues to grow, as industry throughput improves. They're also growing share through higher adoption of mobile platform automation. Finally, BAND-IT was affected by softness in auto and industrial demand, but continues to deliver very strong above-average profitability. Finally, we were thrilled last week to announce the acquisition of Mott. We'll talk a bit more about the company in a moment, as we update our work within capital deployment. Turning to Slide 4. Although market headwinds persist, we are leveraging our strong technical and innovation capabilities as well as our close customer partnerships to position our business for growth across technology-enabled markets and applications. Our materials processing technology, MP350 Microlyser Processor, won the Biotech Innovation Award at Interfax, the leading global pharmaceutical and biotechnology conference. The MP350 is designed for production scale cell disruption, which is used in the manufacturing of many biotech products, such as antigens for vaccines and viral vectors supporting gene therapy. In the life sciences area, our new Melles Griot XPLAN CCG Lens Series, imaging system, released in February, is providing customer access to superior quality optics with off-the-shelf lead time. This aligns with our strategy to deliver leading innovation and operational scale to support our customers from prototype to production, positioning us well for growth. During the second quarter, our intelligent water inspection team at EPAC launched Verisighht Ultra. This inspection technology tackles challenging infrastructures with remote access and an intuitive digital interface, capturing and converting data into powerful insights in the inspection of wastewater management systems. This is one of the many examples of how we're helping municipalities deliver clean water to their communities. We also received customer approval at our Trebor business for the next generation of sustainable Ultra Pure Water Heater and pump applications used to support the semiconductor wafer fabrication process. The Quantum NXT heaters have saved semiconductor manufacturers over 0.5 billion liters of ultra-pure water this year alone. We anticipate this will provide long-term growth as the semiconductor market reaccelerates. And in our Fire & Safety group, our teams unveiled the WildCAT solution for brush trucks used to fight wildland fires. Through a touchscreen application in the cab, firefighters can take control of essential water path functions, while stationary or on the move, in a much safer environment. With wildfire season clearly upon us in North America, this is a critical solution that can really make a difference. Now, turning to our disciplined capital deployment initiative on Slide 5, we continue to lever our strong balance sheet to tune our portfolio for profitable growth through strategic acquisitions. Last week, we announced the acquisition of Mott Corporation, a leader in the design and manufacturing of centered porous material structures and flow control solutions with deep material science knowledge and process control capabilities. Mott develops highly engineered configurable mission-critical solutions for scalable high-quality applications. Their business is complementary to our broader Applied Materials Science Technology businesses within HST, including Nuon, STC and Optical Technologies. And perhaps most impressively, they deliver for customers with an outstanding culture that fits really well with ours. We believe the addition of Mott, will deliver value for IDEX, via strong organic growth, EBITDA margin expansion to above HST average and near-term EPS accretion. In addition to Mott, we acquired a small company, Subterra, on July 25. Subterra's technologies help digitize underground infrastructure. It will become part of the intelligent water platform within our FMT segment, adding an important piece to our analytics solution across wastewater collection systems. Finally, as we optimize our portfolio, we continually reconsider the long-term growth prospects for all of our businesses. Occasionally and typically with smaller companies that like a path to scale, we decide to sell to an owner that can better maximize potential. During the second quarter, we divested Alfa Valvole for $45.5 million in cash. They operated within our FMT segment. With that, I'll turn it over to Abhi to discuss our financial results. Abhi Khandelwal : Thanks, Eric. Turning to the consolidated financial results on Slide 6. Please note that all comparisons are against the prior year period, unless otherwise stated. Orders of $773 million were up 1% on a reported basis and up 2% organically. We saw mid single-digit organic growth in FSDP and HST, which were partially offset by a mid single-digit decline in FMT, driven by projects being pushed to the right. Second quarter sales of $807 million was down 5% reported and 4% organically. We experienced an 11% decline in HST, while FMT and FSDP were essentially flat as compared to the prior year period. Second quarter gross margin and adjusted gross margin were 45.4%, an expansion of 70 basis points, driven by strong price cost and favorable operational productivity, partially offset by unfavorable mix, higher employee-related costs and lower volume leverage. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.8%, down 60 basis points. However, as compared to Q1, adjusted EBITDA was up 180 basis points. The strong sequential expansion highlights our team's continued focus on deploying 80, 20 and to drive profitability, as we manage through challenging market dynamics. I will discuss the drivers of second quarter adjusted EBITDA on the next slide in a moment. On a GAAP basis, our Q2 effective tax rate was 21.2% versus 22.4% in the prior period. The decrease was primarily due to a discrete benefit from research and development incentive resolution related to prior years from an international taxing authority. Second quarter net income was $141 million, generating an EPS of $1.86. Adjusted net income was $156 million with adjusted EPS of $2.06, down $0.12. Free cash flow for the quarter was $118 million, a decrease of 2%. We achieved a conversion rate of 75% of adjusted net income, a 310 basis-point improvement on a year-over-year basis. We have a strong balance sheet, and this quarter, we repaid $25 million of the $50 million previously outstanding debt under our term facility, and we paid $52.2 million in cash dividends. The dividend was our 119th consecutive quarterly dividend payout. Moving on to Slide 7, which details the adjusted EBITDA drivers. For the second quarter, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $17 million. The 4% organic sales reduction unfavorably impacted adjusted EBITDA decreased by $17 million. The 4% organic sales reduction unfavorably impacted adjusted EBITDA by $23 million, flowing through at our prior year adjusted gross margin rate. The negative volume flow-through was partially offset by strong price cost spread of 100 basis points in the quarter and operational productivity, resulting in a $13 million benefit over the prior year. In the quarter, we saw unfavorable mix driven by dispensing and lower overall industrial activity. These factors resulted in a negative 48.7% organic flow-through. The impact of FX lowered adjusted EBITDA by $1 million, while acquisitions net of divestitures was flat on a quarter-over-quarter basis, as the benefits from our acquisitions were offset by adjusted EBITDA from divested companies. This resulted in a negative 42.4% flow-through for the second quarter. I will now review segment level performance. Turning to slide 8 and FMT segment. In Q2, orders decreased 4% organically, driven primarily by the cyclical decline in the ag market and push out industrial project activity, as Eric discussed in his opening remarks. Organic sales were flat as lower volumes, particularly in our industrial safety and pump businesses were offset by continued strong price capture. More specifically, we are seeing stable day rates across industrials. We're seeing project spending pushouts in the current macroeconomic climate. Our water businesses continue to benefit from strong municipal activity. While the ag markets are experiencing a cyclical downturn, our teams continue to make their own luck, and we are pleased with our team's performance against the current backdrop. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 140 basis points due to higher discretionary spending, lower volume leverage and higher employee-related costs, partially offset by strong price cost spread and favorable operational productivity. Moving on to slide 9 and our HST segment. Despite slower than expected recovery in the semiconductor industry and delayed industrial projects due to demand softness, organic orders were up 5% year-over-year. Organic sales were down 11%, primarily driven by our Life Sciences and Analytical instrumentation markets. While the market is experiencing a transitional period, we continue to work closely with our customers on innovation as we position ourselves for growth, while we wait for the markets to recover. While we are seeing early signs of encouragement in our semicon end markets, we have not yet seen the inflection in our orders. In line with our FMT industrial businesses, our HST industrial businesses are also experiencing project pushouts. Q2 adjusted EBITDA margin for HST improved 10 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the net accretive impact of acquisitions and divestitures. On an organic basis, adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 20 basis points, driven by lower volume leverage, unfavorable mix and higher employee-related costs, partially offset by operational productivity, strong price cost and lower discretionary spending. Sequentially, margins improved 150 basis points despite a sequential sales decline, which is a reflection of our strong focus on driving operational efficiency. Now turning to slide 10. Organic orders in our Fire & Safety/Diversified Products segment were up 6%. Organic net sales were up 1% compared to the prior year, driven by price capture across all markets and continued dispensing project wins in emerging markets. We are seeing positive trends within the Fire & Safety business as the OEMs continue to work their backlogs down. BAND-IT saw weakness tied to auto and weaker industrial project activity. Q2 adjusted EBITDA margin declined 40 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to higher employee-related costs and lower volume leverage, partially offset by strong price cost and operational productivity. With that, I would like to provide an update on our outlook for the third quarter and full year on slide 11. Note that our guidance does not contemplate the impact from future acquisitions. For the third quarter, we project organic sales to increase 0% to 1% compared to prior year. We anticipate an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 27%, with GAAP EPS in the range of $1.61 to $1.66, and adjusted EPS in the range of $1.85 to $1.90. On a year-over-year basis, we expect low single-digit organic sales decline in HST and FSDP and low single-digit growth in FMT. Given our current view on the timing of end market recoveries, we are revising our full year outlook. We now expect revenue to decline 1% to 2% compared to our prior outlook of growth of 0% to 2%. Given the revised organic assumptions, we expect full year adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 27% versus a prior outlook of approximately 28%. We project GAAP diluted EPS to range from $6.85 to $6.95 compared to our previous guidance of $7.13 to $7.43, and adjusted EPS to range from $7.80 to $7.90 versus our previous outlook of $8.15 to $8.45. To update to a full year revenue guidance implies mid-single-digit organic sales decline in SSD with low single-digit growth in FMT and FSDP. We will continue to closely monitor the end markets, while maintaining our focused effort on driving profitable growth. With that, I will turn it over to Eric for closing remarks. Eric Ashleman : Thanks, Abhi. I'm on slide 12. Today, along the way, we touched on each of our key value drivers : organic growth, inorganic growth and margin expansion. We continue to apply our IDEX operating model, an 80/20 philosophy across all aspects of our business. It frames our culture and drives our growth and profitability. We are innovating and winning today with our best 80s customers in very attractive markets. We believe broader economic support will really amplify these efforts over time. We have stepped up inorganic efforts with a series of thematic proprietary acquisitions intended to drive above-average growth in advantaged markets. And we continue to strip complexity out of our businesses to support maximum financial leverage and impact. Thanks again to our IDEX employees and partners around the world for all that you do to drive trusted solutions that improve lives. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Mike Halloran from Baird. Your line is now live. Mike Halloran : Good morning, everyone. Eric Ashleman : Hi, Mike. Mike Halloran : So let's start by understanding the change in the guide here. If I hear the comments right, Eric, the underlying daily rates were relatively stable in the quarter. And demand commentary has, I don't know, maybe a touch of optimism to it, but there's been more project pushouts and timing-related things. So the core of the question is, what's really changed from an end market dynamic as we move through the second quarter into the back half? The magnitude of the drop of the organic trends in the back half versus where it was previously seems more severe than the comments you're making. So I just kind of want to bridge the gap between the two, if you would. Eric Ashleman : Yes. So look, I think you hit the first part of it dead on here. I kind of walked and I went back a little further, kind of walked it from December, all the way up to the present. And we've seen kind of this level of core rate stabilization since that initial pullback from the exuberance of Q1, right around that March time and it held through the quarter. And that's across the board in FMT and the industrial like portions of HST. I think the two components that are most different from us, relative to the last guidance, is we had anticipated some semicon launch in HST. There's a lot of signals set our way around ramps up in capacity. I mean, obviously, that sector had trouble with it last time. It just didn't materialize into orders. And in fact, we had some deferments in that area pretty late in the late innings of the second quarter, pushed into the back half that we've now got to keep an eye on. The second piece, we never talk about project business as a massive part of IDEX. But I got to say that what changed here sort of mid-May on, and we saw a lot of it in June, some of it continuing into July. I think it's pinging off the two uncertainty elements that I talked about here. It's this notion of inflation and rate relief and when it's going to come, which has been sort of out there since that March time frame. Just a lot of political uncertainty as kind of the second thing. So we've had these conversations with distributors, OEMs. We've asked them about their own businesses, how you're thinking about it, and you kind of consistently hear those two things. And then for us, it's manifested, as I said in the opening comments, not a cancellation or pullback in resourcing, but just approval loops that take longer to come together. So for us, that played out. We saw it in FMT in a few sectors. We saw it across some of the markets in HST. And we saw it in that, frankly, the growth initiative file that we also referenced here that we were counting on to lift a bit for us in the back half. And in fact, some of those projects, too, have that same narrative and overhang. So I think the optimism, through all of that, is that ultimately, those questions are going to be resolved. As they resolve, the fact that these are still resourced, we're still engaged, we're still talking about what comes next. I think that's where the comment -- the confidence comes from and the fact that it's sitting on a core foundation those day rates, what that tells you is that the system is still operating. It's still effective. People are maintaining things. Those two pieces together give you the long-term view that I think eventually, this sorts itself out. Mike Halloran : So the follow then up on that then is, how do you think this recovery curve plays out? And if you listen to your comments on a lot of the price activity still there, more push out, more timing-oriented and some stability on the daily rates. Is this a scenario when these things start hitting, we could see a pretty rapid recovery pace? I'm not saying this year, not even asking for a timing component to it, or are you thinking something a little bit more iterative and modest as we think about moving into 2025? Because at the end of the day, it seems like you're saying, there's a lot of things underneath the service -- surface to be really positive about. And it's just a question of when they hit. And so just trying to understand the recovery timing from your perspective. Eric Ashleman : Yes. I'll kind of go through that in two dimensions, and I'm sure the second dimension, we'll talk about as well in terms of those kind of core sectors in HST that have been pressured for a while. But if I start where I just left off on the last discussion, the uncertainty attributable to those two dynamics kind of interest rate and where that's going to go, interest rate travel and geopolitical situation, good shot those are resolved to some degree here as we close out the year. And we've seen in other occasions when things like that have been resolved, and there's a lot of captive energy, things have started pretty aggressively. We'll have to see. We'll have to see. I mean rates have been high for a while now. Does it take a while to fire that engine back up again in terms of investment? Q4 and what we see in kind of the book-to-bill ratio there, I think given just the nature of where the election is and where some of these other decisions are going to play out, will be a key input for us to understand kind of rate of travel into 2025. But I would say that the things that are embedded in those projects, the solutions that people are addressing with our technology, things that are being elongated now, I mean, frankly, they're overdue. They need to happen. We've kind of talked about this for a while. And I think I'm pretty optimistic that those ultimately get deployed and get deployed in a way that's favorable for us as we go forward. I think the other side of it, that's where we're going to come back and take an eye at the life science and analytical instrumentation sector, which, as you know, has been kind of flat for us for a while now after an initial slide of recalibration in the first half of last year. I think there's a little optimism there as well in the conversations we're having that we're closer to the end of that cycle than the middle or the beginning. We're coming up -- by the end of the year, it will be about two years that we've been experiencing that as our customers. We start to now look at the life cycle of the technology that's out there and the opportunity for refresh. We're seeing indications of things like accelerating drug discovery and trials. There's a lot of innovation announcements that our customers are talking about, and we've got great content on the -- that lines up well with us. I think on the China piece of that, I think our expectations have been calibrated for a while. We'll see. I think everyone's looking for signs that stimulus becomes effective there. But I'd see that's a little bit more optimistic in tone and tenor as well. And then finally, on the semicon part, as I said in the remarks in the beginning, a lot of people referencing, hey, 2025 looks like it's going to be a pretty strong cycle. And so we'll be looking for when does the bridge -- when did this bridge link is from here to there. Mike Halloran : Thank you. Eric Ashleman : Thanks Mike. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Vlad Bystricky from Citigroup. Your line is now live. Vlad Bystricky : Hey, good morning guys. Eric Ashleman : Good morning Vlad. Vlad Bystricky : So, maybe just a quick question on free cash flow. I know I think you did about 75% conversion in the quarter. You talked about 100% plus for the year. So can you just talk about what needs to happen to hit that higher conversion rate for the year and sort of your level of visibility or confidence in that? Abhi Khandelwal : Yes, Vlad, I can -- this is Abhi. I can take that. So, first of all, we think about the 75% for Q2 and compared to prior years, it's in line with what we typically see in Q2, just the way the timing of the cash flows play out. I'll answer the other question, which is the confidence level in a cash flow north of 100%, we feel highly confident. That's our forecast for the year. Things that we are focused on that we continue to drive is inventory reduction in line with where the top line is. As you think about the back half of the year and where our top line is, our teams are focused on driving inventory to the right levels that will drive working capital and we feel pretty comfortable with us hitting our free cash flow target. Vlad Bystricky : Great, that's helpful. Appreciate it. And then I wanted to dig in a little on FSDP. The plus 6% organic orders in the quarter and it's pretty encouraging. I guess was there any bigger onetime orders in there to think about? Or sort of, again, your level of visibility to orders remaining positive in the back half if the macro holds as it is? Abhi Khandelwal : Yes, I can give you color on that. So if you think about the order profile for Q2 and where we landed, that growth typically -- pretty much came from FSDP. And if I look at the segment and look at -- or look at the business and where they were, it was primarily driven by Fire or North America OEM demand. So that's where we saw the growth in Q2 from an order standpoint in FSDP. Now keep in mind, in FSDP, we also have dispensing. And so orders sometimes can get choppy because you might -- we've been talking a lot about the dispensing emerging market growth, and those come in bigger chunks of orders. So you could see something in Q1 that we ship throughout the year. But if you think about Q2 and the growth in Q2, it's tied to North America OEM demand that we saw in the quarter. Vlad Bystricky : All right. Thanks, Abhi. I\u2019ll get back in queue. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Nathan Jones from Stifel. Your line is now live. Nathan Jones : Good morning, everyone. Eric Ashleman : Good morning, Nathan. Wendy Palacios : Good morning. Nathan Jones : I think it's been a while since we've talked about fire OEM demand being positive. So that's good to hear. I wanted to follow up on the HST numbers. The guidance does imply that you're going to see a little bit of revenue improvement in the back half relative to the first half. Is that just the absence of inventory destocking that you saw through second half of 2023 and into 2024? And just how you think that's going to progress as we get into the back half? Eric Ashleman : Yes. Well, some of the cases where we talked about, the larger chunks that have been deferred and deferred here more recently. I mean those are lining up closer to the back half of the year. We, again, know what those programs are. We know what the platforms are. And ultimately, they do support the bridge to some of the growth that OEMs are talking about, specifically in the semicon area. We have a couple of other HST programs that we've been monitoring for a while. I mean they're very, very milestone-based, and I'm pretty confident that those are going to hit as well. So I think it's largely attributable to those two things. Nathan Jones : I guess, continuing to follow up on the project pushed out kind of question here. Historically, when industrial companies have started to talk about projects being pushed out, but not canceled, that can be a precursor to projects getting pushed out for an extended period of time. It doesn't sound like you're that concerned that we're in that kind of environment today where you can just say things that got pushed from the second quarter into the second half, get pushed into 2025, et cetera, et cetera. Just comment on your confidence that we're not in that kind of environment where by the time we get to the fourth quarter, we're going to be talking about industrial orders that you thought were going to hit in the second half of 2024 and now being pushed to 2025? Eric Ashleman : So I certainly get the spirit of the question. I'd come back to the magnitude of the reference points here and what they are. So one of the benefits we have in those early indicator businesses that we always talk about in FMT is they're a great gauge of sensitivity to different narratives. And even in the last call, one of the reasons I remarked about the dynamic that we've seen in the pullback in core rates in March and its alignment should, frankly, the hotter inflation read and the uncertainty of where rate relief was going to come in. Is it just, in my mind, showed us the sensitivity level around that particular dynamic in that part of the narrative. And that's maintained throughout. The second one being, frankly, the election cycle here in the US. Almost everything we're talking about is North American based, a North America-centric, even in terms of the numbers, the way it's playing out. So if you look at those two issues, which are ubiquitously showing up in the conversation of why things are being delayed or elongated or pushed to the right, we actually know that those two are going to have resolution points, but the certainty is pretty high, at least on the first. And on the second, of course, we know what comes in November. And we -- I've seen these cycles a couple of times before where that -- it's not unusual for things to be somewhat captive when these dynamics are playing out. I think the -- obviously, the post-inflation wave, that's a new one. But I think we're closer to resolution on it than the beginning and just that sensitivity and the way that these are lining up, I think it gives me some confidence that as we watch those go, you're going to see some things be relieved here. Nathan Jones : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Eric Ashleman : Thanks, Nathan. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Thank you, good morning. I you all hope one of your industrial peer conference call.The next question today is coming from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I don't know if you all were listening to one of your industrial peer conference call. I'm just kidding, but Dave were saying the exact same things about extended approval loops and some nervousness about election and some project push-outs. So the commentary is familiar and so you guys are not an outlier. So I just wanted to share that. The question first is it's kind of like what we're not hearing about analytical instruments, life science destocking, you said it's in line with expectations. Is the destocking over? I know you got to be really careful about declaring that, but just what's your sense today. Eric Ashleman : Well, look, once -- I mean the way I look at a lot of these issues is you just kind of listening for Qs in conversations. And that's one of the reasons, as I talked about it earlier, I mentioned positive aspects, like innovation, like drug trials, accelerating, like duration of the cycle and need for refreshes. Honestly, at the customer level, that's the kind of things we're hearing about. It's not to suggest there aren't pockets of finished good inventory out there on a global basis. Again, it's super hard for us to see that. But what you don't hear is kind of a domination of 9the headlines with that aspect that we did earlier in the cycle. So I still think it's uncertain in our own numbers and guide here. I mean we haven't called victory on it, and we've kind of held the line here for the rest of the year. But I am noticing that there is more positive commentary generally. And to be candid, I think we're just about ready to lap the duration of the run up here as well. So I think it's a lot of those things converging. I'm probably most excited of any element in it, just the level of innovation that I know we've been we've been participating in and I've been talking about, I think you're starting to see that now start to hit the market in a bigger way for our end customers. That in itself is a vote of confidence, if not in the exact short term, certainly in the medium and the long term. Abhi Khandelwal : And Deane, this is Abhi. Just to build on what I just said, if I look at the performance this year and just look at the first half, quarter-over-quarter, 1 to 2, the performance has been relatively flat. So to Eric's point, we weren't expecting a recovery in life sciences this year. But if I look at the performance, it has been flat. Deane Dray : Yeah, that's exactly the way it appears to us, but just want to see if there was anything else below the radar screen. And then second question is given the kind of uncertain backdrop, how about you all making any changes in your discretionary spending? Any pullback in growth investments? You reaffirm your CapEx for the year, but any changes there that you would highlight or not changes that you would highlight? Eric Ashleman : Yeah. I would say steady as she goes there. I mean, as we said before, growth investments, typically for us are people based. They're domain experts. They're the people that are really, really good engineering things and figuring things out with close proximity to customers. The innovation cycle takes longer than a lot of people will recognize in mission-critical spaces like this. So making sure that people are engaged and doing the right work. That's always part of what we do. And maybe even more important now than in a relatively choppy period, you're staying on that case because you ultimately could feel that gap later on in our own growth numbers. I will say, I referenced maybe more specifically, the work we're going to do with 80/20 as we talk about Mott coming on the board. And one of the things that that's going to help them do, and it helps us across IDEX is that's actually a source of resource deployment and reallocation of resources that we have here from areas that are not as impactful to areas that are more impactful. So as we play that out business to business and play it out in acquisitions, it's a way to kind of augment the power of resources in areas where we want to apply them without actually upping the spend profile overall. And we indicated that when we referenced it in the transaction as an area of margin lift for the company as they grow, but it's just representative of how we deploy it more generally and more broadly at IDEX. Abhi Khandelwal : And Deane, this is will be -- I know you're going to see it in the commentary in the press release and even in the 10-Q, but if you look at FSDP and HST, discretionary spend is down. And where you will see an increase is FMT. But quite frankly, that's tied to our digitization effort. That's front end, and that's one of the growth best that we are focused on. So overall, I'd say you'd see a discretionary reduction across the two businesses, with the exception of -- our two segments with the exception of FMT. Deane Dray : Really helpful. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question today is coming from Matt Summerville from D.A. Davidson. Your line is now live. Matt Summerville : Thanks. Just a couple of quick ones. First, can you quantify the level of price capture you saw in Q2? And remind us, is that consistent with what you saw in Q1? And then similarly, if you can also compare your organic book-to-bill in Q2 versus Q1? And then I have a follow-up. Abhi Khandelwal : Yeah, Matt, absolutely. So if I think about the price capture, it's in line with the guidance that we laid out for the year. So price capture for the quarter was closer to 2%. But the bigger thing that we talked about that we were focused on is the price/cost spread. And our price cost spread for the quarter was 100 bps. And if you recall, what we have said, going into the year, we were targeting between 80 to 100 bps. So we're on the high end of the price/cost capture for the quarter. From a book-to-bill standpoint for the quarter, we landed at 0.96 versus 1Q of 1.02. Now that said, part of this is the timing of when the blankets booked in the quarter. In Q1, we had a few blankets that got booked that we shipped throughout the year. Q2 had lesser of those. So the best way to think about our book-to-bill is as we go towards the tail end of the year, like Eric alluded to, one of the things that we are focused on is our book-to-bill ratio because that's where we see a lot of blankets come through that feed the revenue for 2025. Matt Summerville : Got it. And then just a follow-up on the analytical instrumentation life sciences. I just want to be clear. At this point, is it -- are you thinking the inventory drawdown is indeed completely in the rearview mirror? And to that extent, are you seeing OEMs generally carry less inventory than they were pre-COVID? Or is the absolute stocking level reverting back towards something more in line with the pre-COVID level? Thank you. Eric Ashleman : Yes. Well, so again, there's kind of two pockets of inventory. One, we have a lot more visibility to than another. So the inventory, let's say, between us and customers. So those would be components and things that we supply them. I mean the planning levels that they have today are pretty typical for what they've been, in the past in terms of replenishment rates and how far away we are and how much lead time we're being asked to deliver. So that's been, honestly, back in sync now for a while. The inventory of finished goods, which, of course, passed our customers and extend globally, less clear for us, but to the extent we have not seen further erosion in demand here, and we've been holding relatively flat and continue to project it that way. I don't think it's -- we don't see it as a significant driver going forward and in fact, are leaning on those points of optimism looking for the turn, which we hope to be somewhere into 2025. Matt Summerville : Thank you, Eric. Eric Ashleman : Thanks. Abhi Khandelwal : Thanks, Matt. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Joe Giordano from Cowen. Your line is now live. Joe Giordano : Hey. Good morning, guys. Eric Ashleman : Hi. Abhi Khandelwal : Hey, Joe. Joe Giordano : Hey. So just inherent in the revenue guide for the second half of the year, what are you thinking for orders for FMT and HST like in dollars versus the 2Q level? Do they get better or worse from here? Abhi Khandelwal : If I look at our guide and you kind of think about the back half that we have guided, yes, the orders do get better in terms of dollars sequentially from first half to second half. Joe Giordano : Okay. And then, if I look -- and I think this is -- it's tough to analyze with companies now in the post-COVID, given how supply chain gets crazy. But if I look at all of your -- each of your segments independently, on like a trailing couple of years, like if I look at since COVID, orders -- the excess orders over revenue, it's pretty significant still. So like I would think that there's more backlog coverage than like the guidance suggests, given like from a trailing three-year or whatever, there's significantly more orders than revenue. So like, are you seeing customers not taking delivery as you think for orders that are in backlog? Or are you seeing cancellations there? Eric Ashleman : I want to make sure we're seeing it the same way. I mean, typically, backlog, we're a smaller backlog company. We normal course of business for us is kind of half a quarter is assured, and we go find the rest. That's a general statement for IDEX that absolutely in the pandemic year has changed. Like, it did for everybody else. I mean I think we doubled it kind of at the height here and had a quarter's worth of insurance, maybe a little bit more as people over ordered and did everything they could for supply chain assurance. Maybe sooner than many companies, we actually reverted back to a very typical backlog profile, and we've been there for a while now. So kind of half a quarter in front of us got to go hunt for the rest. So the dynamics in backlog for us are not that different. The lead times and replenishment that we're being asked to provide in all three segments is pretty typical. I think the only thing that's atypical here for us has been the level of project commitments and those discussions around when the next thing might be coming. And I'll just point back to the indicators that we talked about as to what's driving it. Joe Giordano : Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Andrew Buscaglia from BNP Paribas. Your line is now live. Andrew Buscaglia : Hey. Good morning, guys. Eric Ashleman : Hi. Wendy Palacios : Hi. Andrew Buscaglia : I wanted to focus on margins. I think you said in the past, exiting the year, you could see a little bit of a lift. It seems like guidance might imply that too. But in terms of getting back to that 30% -- that level, how much of it is more dependent on volume coming back versus mix? Because I'm trying to gauge some of these higher growth areas coming back. I guess what are the dynamics as that pans out \u2013 margin? Abhi Khandelwal : Andrew, I think you cut off for a second or two there, so I might have missed the piece. But let me try to answer that question. If I don't completely get to your answer, then just ask me, and I'll do it. But if you just take a step back and kind of think about where we are, your general comment about depending on volume, volume is a big part of it because, of course, when we see top line growth, we lever really nicely on our businesses. So that is a big component of how margin expansion happens. But that said, though, given where we are you will notice, sequentially, our margin profile got better by 180 basis points, right, despite very minimal help from volume. And that's really tied to the work that we do around 80-20 complexity reduction and cost out in the light of where we've been. So as you think about the balance of the year and how we're thinking about the year, exiting Q4, so I want to be very careful. I'm talking about rates exiting Q4, not full year rates. We're thinking about HST closer to that 28% kind of profile on EBITDA, FMT closer to 34%, and then FSDP in the 28% to 29% range from an EBITDA standpoint. Andrew Buscaglia : Very helpful. And yes, I wanted to focus on in Fluid & Metering. The reasonable water strength has been a nice story for a while for you and others. Where are you guys to be thinking that inning? Or what inning do you think you guys are in? And how much of your business is influenced by government spending or government funding? Eric Ashleman : Well, so look, I think the cycle plays out for a while, mainly because the intentionality of that funding that's kind of spread over much of the industry. It just takes a long time to spend. These are complex engineering projects for multiple players, not just us. A good portion of things that have been announced is not actually spent yet or engineered. So I always thought of this as kind of a multiyear safety blanket or a warm comfortable blanket, either one. We're positioned actually in -- we do an important work to help spend that money. So I think it's one of the reasons we're seeing that the strength in our business. We do analytical work that actually helps write the capital request. So essentially, many of our customers are actually engineers, civilian engineers that are then using that data to suggest projects that are going to tap into funding of the type that you're talking about here. So there's a portion of it that is intentional and it's coming from announced government programs. A decent amount of municipalities, of course, is government-funded, but that's ultimately through taxation. And we have -- look, we participate in the industrial water side of this, too, and that, of course, is in tie to private markets. But I think there's a nice run here overall, if for no other reason that it just takes a while to frankly, bring all this to fruition. Andrew Buscaglia : Yes. Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question today is coming from Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. Your line is now live. Q \u2013 Rob Wertheimer : Thank you. Good morning. I apologize if this -- I cut out for a while in the audio. So if I missed something or be labor point you've covered, you can just cut me off. But on the project delay side, is that tied to specific government policies that might open up one way or the other? Or is it just more of a general unease or uncertainty that has affected how people are willing to spend? Eric Ashleman : Yes. So we did touch on that before a bit, but I think it's worth a second go around. I mean it's very specific around two very general themes, one around sort of the cost of money and the fact that it's been higher for longer, and there's uncertainty as to the rate of travel to something better. That's all about inflation and interest rate and that dynamic, which everybody is watching. And I think the second one is around political uncertainty and uncertainty of outcomes given the polarization here in North America for approaches. In our conversations, it doesn't really then travel below that to something more specific because frankly, our business is -- it's more diverse. It's spread across different places where at the component level. So we're not as heavily indexed to a program or another program. It's kind of like the answer I gave on the water side of it. The fact that there's intentionality there and it's going to take multiple years to spend it is kind of good enough for us to then participate in the way we do in municipalities and industries across the globe to participate in that. So it's very generalized as we're thinking of it here. Q \u2013 Rob Wertheimer : Perfect. Thank you. And then could you remind us the rate-sensitive businesses within FMT that you're kind of using as guidelines. What's the nature of the activity there in the business? Could you just give us a little bit more background around that, and I will stop there. Thanks. Eric Ashleman : Yes. It's a series of businesses in the FMT, where a lot of them are kind of pumps and bulbs and fluids. So they're used for a broad array of purposes. They go to market in -- typically in through industrial distribution. And because of the kind of customized nature of the way that we do things in our rapid fulfillment, we can get an order on a Monday, ship it on a Wednesday and it's in service on a Friday. I say all that because what they -- because of the nature of that, they provide really good insight into kind of action consumptive activities across the board. And it's -- frankly, it's more than 50% of the order flow in those businesses. So we use them as diagnostics to tell us kind of what's the state of health there. And as we've talked about them here, what we've said is there's 2 dimensions that we see at work the core day-to-day rates, which is this short-term fulfillment, think of it as somebody maintaining their factory as they run two shifts, that's steady. It has been steady, and it's really back to the assumptions we had in the fall. It was only interrupted briefly to the positive for a three-month period, as I think there was more anticipation that we're going to have more favorable rate relief. And it sort of came back down and it's been steady state. There's a tie-in there with project work. And project work in our world, I don't think of them as stadiums or massive things like that. It could be a simple back-end expansion onto a food plant or something like that. It kind of moves you from a pump or two to something like 40 or 50 for us, but that's tied to an approval process and a discrete decision that's important. And that's kind of the piece we've said has been hung up in the works here with those two more generalized themes that I talked about. So that's what the insight is telling us. We're very happy to see that the day rates are supportive of just strong and relatively stable industrial activity. And we look forward to the day the uncertainty leaves the project-driven side of it, which is going to complement it overall. Rob Wertheimer : Perfect. Thanks so much. Eric Ashleman : You bet. Operator : Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments. Eric Ashleman : Well, thank you. Listen, I recognized we struggle a bit here to find our organic guidance footing over the last six quarters. I realized a lot of that chop is coming out of the HST segment. And I'm fully aware that we're disproportionately investing in HST organically and inorganically is a key element of our strategy. What I want to make sure you understand is this is the right call for our business. Even in a period of uncertain transition for some of these foundational markets, we've talked about a lot here today. Third of this segment lies across two verticals within life science and analytical instrumentation and advanced semi-con manufacturing. They're pressured today, but no doubt they're going to have wins at their backs for years to come. We just built another third of the segment that allows us to lever the supplied material science technology to a really narrow band of high-quality application areas, and the Mott acquisition completes this phase of the build. And then the remaining third, it's composed of high-quality businesses, where it's all number one in their respective niches and very, very IDEX-like in the way they function. So together, we're innovating to set really critical specification points, that are going to position us for leadership in the years to come, markets that are going to shape our futures. And we'll see the financial benefit of that play out, just as we've seen it play out in the legacy businesses of FMT and FSDP. It's really important that we kind of get IDEX into the mix as these markets form up and launch. So I look forward to walking you through our progress on that in the quarters and the years to come. And I wish you all a good day. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Wendy Palacios, Vice President of FP&A and Investor Relations. Thank you, Wendy. You may begin. Wendy Palacios : Good morning, everyone. This is Wendy Palacios, Vice President of FP&A and Investor Relations for IDEX Corporation. Thank you for joining us for our discussion of the IDEX third quarter 2024 financial highlights. Last night, we issued a press release outlining our company's financial and operating performance for the 3 months ending September 30, 2024. The press release, along with the presentation to be used during today's webcast, can be accessed on our investor website at investors.idexcorp.com. Joining me today are Eric Ashleman, our Chief Executive Officer and President; and Abhi Khandelwal, our Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call up for your questions. Turning to Slide 2. Please note that during today's call, we will present certain non-GAAP financial measures. We will also make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding events or developments that we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties. Actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. We do not assume any obligation to update them. Information regarding these factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements is available on our website and in our SEC filings. With that, I'll now turn this call over to our CEO and President, Eric Ashleman. Eric Ashleman : Thanks, Wendy, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 3. Our IDEX teams drove strong Q3 results in an uncertain environment. Here are the highlights. We delivered nice organic growth supported by excellent margins in our Fluid & Metering Technology and Fire Safety and Diversified Products segments. Our free cash flow across IDEX of $192 million was 33% of adjusted net income. Execution through operational excellence was really strong overall. We're pleased to see orders growth within our Health & Science Technologies segment, and our teams are digging into the Mott acquisition with focus energy as we align around our best long-term growth prospects across all of our recent HST acquisitions. We have some important projects to deliver in Q4 in all segments that set us up well for next year. From the start of Q2 to the end of Q3, we really haven't seen a noticeable change in the macro environment. The recent interest rate drop by the Fed and China's stimulus announcements has yet to create positive ripple effects through improved certainty. An extremely close U.S. November election with polarized outcomes also isn't helping in the near term. Take all of that together, and we continue to see an environment where day-to-day order rates remain stable with an absence of larger long-term project commitments. This dynamic really holds true in the more fragmented industrial markets of FMT. We're encouraged by an increase in quoting activity as we move from summer to fall and we don't see projects moving from delayed to canceled. We'll watch for signs either way as many customers move more formally consider their capital and OpEx deployment within calendar budget cycles. We continue to see strength within our intelligent water markets, and I'll talk more about our focused efforts there on the next slide. Within the Health & Science Technologies segment, we saw a robust Q3 organic orders increase partially driven by blanket orders, many of them landing within our IDEX Health & Science business. Admittedly, we're comparing to the low point of last year, but we drove year-over-year order increases in all of our major HST reporting areas. We booked a bit of backlog overall this quarter, and we posted a nice sequential uptick to our highest order point in 2024. We are encouraged by these trends within HST, but remain cautious as we consider the trajectory of recovery within our most important markets. Our defense, aerospace and satellite communication markets are strong. They experienced double-digit growth within the quarter. However, most major semiconductor customers are pushing out the next industry inflection point into at least the midpoint of 2025. Life Sciences and analytical instrumentation customers are more positive than they have been. They're innovating at a rapid clip and launching a lot of new gear. But they, too, are pretty noncommittal to the timing of next level growth rates. Our teams continue to deploy resources toward their best long-term growth prospects with an eye towards applied materials science technology synergies as we integrate Mott alongside our recent HST acquisitions. Fire Safety and Diversified Products had a solid quarter exceeding expectations, achieving record sales performance. Our fire business continues to grow share and scale production to meet North American OEM multiyear backlogs. BAND-IT experienced strong growth from aerospace demand. Finally, recall our dispensing business was impacted by top-line headwinds of $40 million from the end of a large 2023 North American large retailer replenishment cycle, but our teams continue to work to offset that pressure by delivering strong growth within emerging markets. We've closed that year-over-year gap considerably, delivering over 15,000 units from our new facility in India, just opened in April of last year. As an aside, I want to thank our team members from IDEX Fire & Safety, who chipped in to help people in North Carolina following the devastation from the remnants of Hurricane Helene. Finally, we're thrilled to formally close on the Mott acquisition this quarter. Things are really exciting there. We'll share more details on the progress of the integration activities and some of the benefits we are experiencing early on in a slide to follow. Turning to slide 4. Our intelligent water platform continues to be a bright spot for us. We see significant opportunities now and in the future as municipalities and industries around the world cope with the impacts of climate change as they navigate dynamic regulatory and funding ecosystems to support the best use and management of water. Water management is a sector that has classically been slow to change. Those days are over. Our aging and neglected infrastructure just can't handle the demands of expanding populations and increasingly severe weather events. What was once underground and out of sight is now impossible to ignore. What was once analog and manual is now increasingly digital and automated. And federal, regulatory and funding support is stepping in to drive growth from above within a typically bottoms up local and regional landscape. And our teams are ready to meet the challenge. Below ground, IDEX Intelligent Water aims to be the collection system experts, monitoring flow of storm water and identifying small issues before they become big ones. Above ground, our teams help protect the environment with solutions that treat water and reduce the amount being used in critical processes. You see some examples here on the slide. The Envirosight Verisight ultra camera inspection system gives teams better capabilities for remote inspection of sewers in more challenging environments than before. Most recent addition to the platform is Subterra, which acquired about three months ago. This rapid sewer screening solution complements our core inspection technologies with iPEK, Envirosight and WinCan. Subterra\u2019s SewerScout floats untethered downstream, capturing three-dimensional data along the way. The market needs a simple condition assessment tool in their wastewater collection systems, specifically for large pipes that are rarely inspected. Subterra's Technologies performing within an integrated digital analytics suite addresses that need and expands our overall IDEX expertise in this space. And yet another example of IDEX serving semiconductor manufacturers, the Quantum XT ultrapure water heater and pumps from Trevor continues to save billions of leaders of ultrapure water. In this market, Trevor's innovation displaced in a established heater pump manufacturer that didn't recognize or address quickly enough the semiconductor industry's needs to reduce water consumption. Now, turning to slide 5 and an update on our acquisition of Mott Corporation. Less than two months since completing our acquisition of Mott, the partnership is off to a fast start. A few high-potential IDEX team members have formally joined the Mott leadership team in the earliest days of acquisition integration. This gives the Mott team a living key into the rest of IDEX to drive collaborative efficiency. While it's too soon to share specifics, teams from Mott and other IDEX units within HST are already working on innovative new solutions together to leverage Mott's highly engineered filtration technologies. In one instance, a combined team has rapidly developed a customer-ready prototype in the first 90 days of Mott being part of IDEX. Frankly, it's been tremendous to see. As you can see in the photo on the right of slide 5 earlier this month, Mott opened its third manufacturing facility in Connecticut. This plant quadruples Mott's production capacity for custom design ultra-thin porous metal sheets, which are a critical component in the generation of green hydrogen, a low emission fuel essential for world's energy transition. The picture on the left shows Mott's high-purity operations where point-of-use gas filters used in the semiconductor industry are laser marked, pressure and helium leak tested, inspected then pulse cleaned before bagging. As a reminder, Mott is a leader in the design and manufacturing of centered porous material structures and flow control solutions. The Mott team has deep material science knowledge and process control capabilities. Their business complementary to our broader applied materials science technology businesses within HST, including Muon, STC Material Solutions and Optical Technologies. We're excited about Mott's history of execution the robust backlog funnel that is built to date with key project deliveries as we close out 2024. With that, I'll turn it over to Abhi to discuss our financial results. Abhi Khandelwal : Thanks, Eric. Turning to the consolidated financial results on slide 6. Please note that all comparisons are against the prior year period unless stated otherwise. Also, the acquisition of Mott is reflected in IDEX's consolidated and HST segment financials as of the close of the transaction on September 5. Third quarter orders of $781 million were up approximately 10% on a reported basis and up 8% organically. We saw orders growth across the portfolio with HST seeing 20% organic growth in the quarter, half of which was partially driven by blanket order activity that will ship in 2025. FSDP had low single-digit organic growth while FMT was essentially flat. We did see slight sequential growth in FMT orders. Third quarter sales of $798 million were up 1% reported and flat organically compared to the prior year. We experienced organic growth of 4% in FSDP and 2% in FMT. HST had a 5% organic decline driven by continued headwinds that I will cover in the upcoming slides. Third quarter gross margin was 44.3% and adjusted gross margin was 44.6%, an expansion of 20 basis points and 40 basis points, respectively. Gross margin expansion was driven by strong price/cost, partially offset by higher employee-related costs. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 26.9%, down 150 basis points. With the acquisition of Mott, our biggest acquisition to date, we had higher than typical M&A spending, which negatively impacted our margins by approximately 40 basis points. We are accelerating the integration of Mott and are excited to see the realization of the expected commercial synergies. We continue to leverage 80/20 across IDEX to deploy resources to growth and reduce complexity. I will discuss the drivers of third quarter adjusted EBITDA on the next slide in a moment. On a GAAP basis, our Q3 effective tax rate was 22.9% versus 20.2% in the prior year period. The prior year rate included certain onetime benefits, which contributed $0.11 of adjusted EPS in the prior year period. Third quarter net income was $119 million, resulting in GAAP EPS of $1.57. Adjusted net income was $144 million with an adjusted EPS of $1.90, down $0.22 or 10%. We achieved the higher end of our guide. And while our guidance did not include contributions from Mott or its related financing costs, these amounts essentially offset one another during the quarter. Free cash flow for the quarter was $192 million, a decrease of 7%. We achieved a conversion rate of 133% of adjusted net income, a 400 basis point improvement on a year-over-year basis. We have a strong balance sheet, and this quarter, we paid over $50 million in cash dividends. We also funded the acquisition of Mott through the combination of approximately $212 million of cash, $279 million of borrowings from our revolving credit facility and $495 million net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes. We maintain a strong investment-grade rating with a 2.4 gross leverage ratio at the close of September. Moving on to Slide 7, which details the adjusted EBITDA drivers. For the third quarter, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $11 million. Our organic sales volume decline of approximately 3% unfavorably impacted adjusted EBITDA by $9 million, flowing through at prior year adjusted gross margin rate. The negative volume flow-through was partially offset by strong price/cost spread of 100 basis points and operational productivity, resulting in a $10 million benefit over the prior year. In the quarter, we saw unfavorable mix, primarily in our industrial businesses and our dispensing businesses. We had higher employee-related costs and higher transaction-related expenses in connection with the acquisition of Mott. All these factors combined resulted in an unfavorable organic flow-through. The impact of FX slightly increased adjusted EBITDA by $1 million and acquisitions net of divestitures added $2 million on a quarter-over-quarter basis as the benefits from our acquisitions more than offset the impact on adjusted EBITDA from divested companies. I will now review segment level performance. Turning to Slide 8 and FMT segment. In Q3, we experienced sequential and mid-single-digit plus organic year-over-year growth in orders across the majority of our businesses. This growth was muted by continued ag cycle headwinds and push out in chemical project activity, resulting in total flat organic orders growth for FMT. Net sales were up 2% organically. We had strong price capture across the segment and experienced high single-digit growth in our industrials and intelligent water businesses. Total segment growth was unfavorably impacted by demand softness in our ag OEM and energy businesses. Our industrial day rates remain steady from Q2 with no change in overall market conditions. The strength in year-over-year organic growth in our Industrial business, was partially due to prior year comps. Our Intelligent Water portfolio continues to see strength in the North American municipal market with strong governmental funding to support ongoing investments. Our energy business are seeing headwinds from weather related in North America, slowdown in propane truck builds and distributor destocking and decreased demand for propane in Europe. Our ag OEM business remains challenged by the market slowdown. Despite this downturn, our teams remain focused, tackling the market headwinds and leveraging 80-20 to redeploy resources. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 160 basis points due to higher employee-related costs, discretionary spending and unfavorable mix, partially offset by price cost. Moving on to slide 9 and our HST segment. Orders grew sequentially and experienced a year-over-year organic growth of 20%. Growth was partially driven by blanket orders in life science and performance pneumatics businesses. Year-over-year comps were also a factor as life sciences, analytical instrumentation and semiconductor markets bottomed the same period last year. Our innovation funnel in life sciences remains active while there is no change in our outlook. Net sales were down 5% organically. Although we have strong price capture, it did not entirely offset the volume declines, driven by continued challenges in the end markets we serve. Our life sciences and analytical instrumentation businesses demand was steady sequentially from Q2 to Q3. Defense, aerospace and satellite communication end markets remained strong. We saw double-digit growth in the quarter. Within semicon, what we are seeing is a push-out in the end market recovery to the second half of next year. Our HST industrial light businesses continue to experience project delays. As I commented earlier, the acquisition of Mott is reflected in HST's segment financials as of the close of the transaction on September 5th. The integration of Mott is moving at a brisk pace. Q3 adjusted EBITDA margin for HST declined 40 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to lower volume and higher employee related costs, partially offset by price cost, favorable operational productivity, cost of work the teams have done to align with the current environment and the net accretive impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Now turning to slide 10. I'd like to take a moment to recognize our FSDP team's performance, delivering record sales and adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. Orders in our Fire &Safety/Diversified Products segment were up 4% organically, driven by Fire & Safety low double-digit growth, partially offset by declines in dispensing and BAND-IT. Net sales were up 4% organically. We had strong price capture and higher volumes, mainly driven by Fire & Safety and BAND-IT. Our Fire & Safety businesses continue to see growth in North America fire OEMs, and we are ramping production to meet their needs. BAND-IT experienced growth driven by strong aerospace demand, offsetting declines in industrial and auto. Our dispensing business experienced declines as expected, driven by headwinds from the North American big box retailer refresh cycle. Growth from the India market had been an offset to this headwind through the first half of this year, due to timing of projects in the emerging markets blending in the first half of 2024. Q3 adjusted EBITDA margin declined 20 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to unfavorable mix with positive price/cost offsetting higher employee-related costs. With that, I would like to provide an update on our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year on Slide 11. For the fourth quarter, we project organic sales to increase 3% to 4% compared to the prior year. We anticipate an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 27% with GAAP EPS in the range of $1.64 to $1.69 and adjusted EPS in the range of $2.01 to $2.06. On a year-over-year basis, we expect mid- to high single-digit organic growth in FMT and FSDP. In HST, we expect flat sales growth. Our full year adjusted EPS outlook remains unchanged and we expect organic revenues to decline 1% to 2% with an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 27%. We project GAAP diluted EPS to range from $6.65 to $6.70 and adjusted EPS to range from $7.85 to $7.90 in line with our prior guidance. The full year revenue guidance implies high single-digit organic sales decline in HST and low single-digit growth in FMT and FSDP. With that, I'll turn it over to Eric for closing remarks. Eric Ashleman : Thanks, Abhi. I'm on Slide 12. Look, it's easy to get caught up in the economic uncertainties that play out quarter-to-quarter. It's been a frustrating last couple of years as we've seen the last echoes of the pandemic play out against an uncertain geopolitical environment, an environment made more uncertain globally by the unprecedented number of 2024 national elections. We've managed well throughout this period. We've improved the long-term growth prospects of IDEX significantly through incredibly focused work within a proprietary M&A funnel. We have some outstanding people and technologies at our disposal to develop trusted solutions to our customers' most difficult problems. We're building relative and absolute scale across business units to support advantaged markets like water, which we discussed today, advanced semiconductor wafer fabrication, Life Sciences and Analytical Instrumentation and space and defense. We're rapidly digitizing traditionally analog applications throughout IDEX as we transform everything from customer acquisition and support to core product functionality. And we continue to grow through our jump-off points within Asia Pacific as these developing markets reach economic trigger points to adopt IDEX advanced technologies. We sometimes take our abilities to execute for granted. We shouldn't. 80/20 isn't a tool at IDEX. It's evolved into an intuitive headset. We can size up the critical view quicker than others and swing our best people to our biggest challenges and opportunities without the need for time-wasting decision loops. Finally, we're talking about collaboration across business boundaries to build scale more than we have in the past. And some have asked if this challenge is the notion of a decentralized IDEX. It doesn't. We've built our culture intentionally over the last 15 years to prepare us for this moment. Our teams collaborate and help each other naturally without stifling structure and bureaucracy to win for customers. We live our purpose every day through our commitment to our core values of trust, team, and excellence. Thanks again to our IDEX employees and partners around the world for all that you do to make IDEX a great company. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morn everyone. Eric Ashleman : Morning Deane. Abhi Khandelwal : Hey Deane. Deane Dray : Can we start with the tone of business, the day rates? Eric, you already kind of given us the good news that the small project delays didn't escalate. So, that was good. And you gave us some color on BAND-IT. But just the progression of the quarter and your read on the day rates, that would be a great place to start. Thanks. Eric Ashleman : Yes. As I said kind of in the opening comments, I mean, they've been stable for a while without really a lot of inflection. So, you don't really see anything different through the summer months month-to-month as it played out in the quarter. A lot of it looks pretty similar to where we were in Q2. And of course, we've got the businesses that are closest to consumption. We track those all the time. They've been steady with a little bit of lift in in them, and we see that playing out the numbers that we posted in kind of our core industrial units here. And so I think good shape on those indicators that the kind of industrial system continues and it's -- we're still making things in plants all across the country, and we're maintaining it. That's kind of what a lot of that indicates. The project and the longer-term commitments, I think that's in about the same place, too. The uncertainty and the overhang of, obviously, the election coming up next week, where that's going to take us, those kind of things, I think it's still sort of out there in the way. We're always looking to see if any of those projects start to suddenly move into a category of either delayed -- or canceled instead of delayed or just not talked about any longer. We don't see that. I actually made a comment about the fact that quoting activity, in fact, is picking up a little bit. which I think is a good sign. And then I'm sure we'll get to it at a certain point, we've got a little bit of revenue ramp here in Q4 and almost all of that is project related with a couple of key things that are in the backlog now. Some of them are underway and near completion and I think are also good signs of confidence of the time that's out ahead of us. Abhi Khandelwal : And Deane, just to build on Eric's narrative a little bit. So, if you just kind of think about Q3 and just maybe talking about SMT on the face, you see organic growth of 2%, if you will. But if you kind of take a step back and go a step deeper, within the FMT business, pumps and water grew high single-digit. You saw valves group grow high single-digit on an organic basis, which was offset by ag and energy. So, even within HST, the core industrial franchise was up high single-digit. Deane Dray : That's really helpful and I appreciate all that color. And just as a follow-up, I love the fact that you put the spotlight on your Intelligent Water portfolio. We met with the team, got to visit each one of these businesses at the WEFTEC Trade Show in New Orleans recently. So, if we had to point to one probably the fastest-growing sector in the water infrastructure is this whole Stormwater Management. So it's -- you guys -- it looks like you get some first-mover advantage there. Can you just talk about critical mass for the Intelligent Water group? Do you need to add more capabilities? What kind of is the funnel like? And just kind of where and how does this business grow from here? Eric Ashleman : Yeah. Well, thanks. We appreciate talking to you and others at that show. And you mentioned a key word. We -- in our commentary about kind of our businesses in that area, we pointed to becoming the collection experts. That's really the work we do here. And that has a lot of focus right there, obviously, through things like Stormwater and significant weather events. That's where you see that play out. And so I think we've got the assets positioned in the right place to really, really focus. And as you saw, they work together. They work together in a way where the hardware and analytics help to give you this predictive insight into not just what's going on in your system in front of you, but what's likely to occur in the future. And I think one of the reasons we're winning is, we think about our end customers, it's certainly operating professionals who are trying to run the system. We have significant customer bases that are specification engineers and project engineers within municipalities and industries. And what they're trying to do is, understand the analytics of the system, the way that kind of the water circuit works, if you will. And then they're trying to put that together to obtain capital project approval. And so at this particular phase of the cycle, the cycle has got more positive funding support with longer duration. Being able to understand your system, so that that you can position yourselves to get funding for your municipality or business is really, really important, and it kind of points right back to the core work that we do. That's sometimes underappreciated and really thinks of kind of day-to-day monitoring, but this very specific engineering kind of partnership that helps people understand their system better, actually allows them to go grab funding that is more available now than it has been. Sorry, you also asked about, yeah, other pieces and things and kind of where we are. Deane Dray : Yeah. Eric Ashleman : I mean, there's -- Subterra is a good example. That's sort of probably an under-the-radar, underappreciated technology that we very much appreciated. We've been working with that company before. And it really helps kind of complete capabilities for us. There are other things we would like to do here within kind of this ecosystem of collection. And so we continue to work in the funnel. We continue to look at things and we're very much -- it is in 80s for us in terms of an area that we would like to make larger, both organically and inorganically overtime. Deane Dray : Great to hear. Thank you. Eric Ashleman : Thanks Deane. Operator : Our next question is from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Nathan Jones : Good morning, everyone. Eric Ashleman : Good morning, Nathan. Wendy Palacios : Good morning. Nathan Jones : I'm going to follow-up on Deane's question there. Because at [indiscernible], you could say the Intelligent Water businesses altogether kind of united brands showing customers what the combined businesses capabilities were. I'm just thinking about how you run those businesses and potentially, how you run some of the businesses in HST to collaborate together. And Eric, that was one of your closing comments, is collaboration across the business units without losing the decentralized structure. How do you kind of manage that process with these businesses? Do you need some kind of integration with the commercial organization, cross training for sales? And how do you manage those businesses so that you drive the collaboration that you want to see without actually going and integrating the businesses? Eric Ashleman : Yeah. It's a great question. And that's a great spot to talk about it. I mean, think of it a little bit as it's kind of -- these areas where we put some scale together, they present themselves as kind of mini versions IDEX. And when you step back from IDEX, I mean, one of the ways that we work it the way that we do is nimbly and agilely as we do. It's a super flat organizational structure. So we have a leader of the water business. And between kind of that leader and leaders of individual pieces of water, I mean, there's not a lot of stacking. So think of this as wide and horizontal more than vertical. That's one of the keys here. And the quality of the people, the quality of the system and operating model allows you to take that span a little bit wider. And so you already got something working for you in terms of being close to the point of impact with all leaders. So that's a key ingredient, doesn't change, it's always been part of IDEX and is as we do this work. But it comes down to strategy. A lot of this -- this is why we work so intensively in terms of building strategy and strategic capabilities and doing it in focused 80s areas of IDEX, so that we would be prepared to understand these worlds and why things need to go together and where they don't. And so in every one of these points, we know the difference between an area where there is collaboration and people are working together because the customer cares about it versus other areas where life goes on in individual pieces and specialized segments, which is -- that's where I think a lot of customers -- or companies get caught. They over-rotate one way or the other. We're actually very comfortable delivering in a hybrid world, because we have ever since I've worked at IDEX. We're just becoming a bit more focused to putting some of the scale to work because the solution set demands it. The problems are harder, they're evolving. They're earlier stages of evolution, so you need more power in the system. So it really does lever everything we've ever thought about in terms of 80-20, everything we do culturally, which celebrates flat organizations and a lack of bureaucracy. And probably the secret sauce for all of it is talent and development that that we do internally to make sure leaders are built in a certain way that they can operate with all of that autonomy. Nathan Jones : Thanks a lot. I guess, my follow-up question is going to be around the HST order number. 20% organic growth, I think Abhi said half of that was from blanket orders. Is the kind of right way to think about without the blanket orders, the order number would have been something like about 305, which is kind of an average where it's been settled in over the last few quarters since the bottom in 2023? So it's kind of no change sequentially, still waiting and seeing, not really getting any better and not getting any worse. Or are these blanket orders indicative of some kind of improvement in some of those markets? Abhi Khandelwal : Yeah. So Nathan, let me try and answer your question. So if you think about it sequentially from 3Q -- or 2Q to 3Q and look at HST, HST was up about $20 million. I'd say about half of that was blanket order activity that we saw from Q2 to Q3 and the other half was just straight demand between different businesses. And then if you think about year-over-year, HST posted about a $51 million organic change in orders on a year-over-year basis. That's, again the same kind of amount for blanket and half of that was demand. So you do see -- go ahead, Nathan. Nathan Jones : I was going to say so you are seeing some -- at least some underlying improvement in the markets there? Abhi Khandelwal : Yes, we are. Life sciences continues to be stable if you look at sequential. But there are markets, like we've said again, semicon is not at a point where it's inflecting. But we are seeing improvement even in our semicon markets sequentially. Eric Ashleman : And then reminder -- yeah, just to finish. I mean, we have half of this segment that kind of is in other high-tech areas that are not in the usual suspects of semiconductor and life science and analytical instrumentation. And those, I mean, they're performing a lot like the industrial businesses that we see elsewhere. So we've got some growth and list there. We've had that from before. I just think, look, at the end of the day, we feel good about the position we see here because we've obviously got a big comp number against the low point last year. But we've seen kind of nice progression away from that and we've just now posted the highest order number for the year and the segment built a little bit of backlog and you have a really good comparison. Abhi Khandelwal : Correct. Eric Ashleman : And some signs of optimism in just the conversations we're having with customers. Doesn't say when the next inflection comes, doesn't really talk about the magnitude of it. But having people leaning in the same direction here, that is one of the signs we wanted to see as we start to move away from just baseline stability. Nathan Jones : Awesome. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Halloran with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Mike Halloran : Hey good morning everyone. So first question kind of ties into a couple of answers that you already had. But maybe talk about, how you're thinking about the sequentials in fourth quarter. I know, Eric, I think you briefly mentioned there was some incremental project activity coming in there. But maybe talk about -- it doesn't seem like there's a change in your day rate, choppy, kind of stable, but choppy month-to-month, week-to-week kind of expectations. And how should we think about that into next year from a backlog order cadencing, et cetera, perspective? In other words, relatively normal sequentials, is that how you're thinking about things in the fourth quarter? Or is that a fair assumption to start next year until we see a change in the backdrop? Kind of any thoughts on how you're thinking about how the next few quarters here play out. Abhi Khandelwal : Yes. So let me take the Q3 to Q4 sequential, and I'll let Eric jump in. So if you kind of think about Q3 to Q4 and think about the guide that was laid out, it's really -- there are a few different places where we have projects that are in the backlog that we've done a lot of work on that are supposed to ship in Q4. So first is around ABEL. They ship big pumps in, and that's in the backlog that the teams are working on executing and getting out the door. Second place you see it is in pharma, in our MPT business where there's backlog that's booked that we are working on. It's a pretty late stage that's going to get up in Q4. And then the last I'd tell you is tied to Mott. We have a big energy project that's scheduled to go out at the end of the quarter. That's part of Q4 guide. So if you think about the sequential guide from Q3 to Q4, a decent part of the ramp is tied to a few different projects that I just laid out, and that's how we think about the ramp from Q3 to Q4. Eric Ashleman : And then, look, past that, I think it's going to depend on what we sort of see play out here in the fourth quarter. I do think this is a period where everybody like us is kind forced to come in and consider their next calendar year, if they're on that cycle, in terms of what bets they're going to make, how they're going to make them. They kind of need to talk to critical suppliers like us as they do it. That would be an interesting source that would inflect it other way. But I think a continuation of stability, that seems reasonable as we go forward. And then it's really a question of what layers and on top of it, what are -- the state of health of commitments and the ability to make them kind of where are we sitting at that point with backlog of other projects, including any that might be there for Mott. We'll layer those in, and then we'll have those up-to-the-minute conversations, see what happened here. Of course, in the election, whether or not that triggered anything. So there's the usual number of suspects that would come in there. But it's been kind of a period of now 2 quarters of kind of base level stability. It at least allows you to then kind of see the pieces that rise above it with pretty good clarity or at least the fact that you need to keep digging for it. Mike Halloran : So then let's move beyond kind of that horizon and you get towards the point where there is a recovery in the market. How would you think about the growth algorithm now that you've done an iterative reshaping of the portfolio here? You've centralized some resources or added central resources to support the decentralized model, the revenue synergy piece. Could you maybe help on the growth algorithm and then break it down by what the drivers or components of that growth look like from market to synergies, to outperformance or however else you want to categorize it? A \u2013 Eric Ashleman : Look, we now have a portfolio that is increasingly starting to weight itself to more faster-growing markets, all the ones that we've acquired into here in HST. And so that's becoming the biggest segment. It's going to carry more of the load as we go forward in periods like the ones you're describing, certainly somewhere off in the future. And so we would see kind of organic rates. We'd always want to outperform our core market entitlements, but we're moving that entitlement to the north. And so we'd like to start to dial IDEX into a kind of mid-single-digit grower plus as we start to navigate that. We'll continue deploy capital on the bottom line. I would say you put a point or two of inorganic growth on top of it, kind of take us to the higher single-digit range when you put the two together. That should allow a beautiful flow-through because these are high-margin businesses and high-margin differentiated markets. And we're still going to practice 80/20 in productivity. We're going to do a lot of it on the acquisitions that we acquired. And so you get nice double-digit earnings expansion through all of that. So slight uptick on the growth rate -- the core growth rates of IDEX because of what's happened in the portfolio, kind of maintenance of the additive dimension of inorganic, which we've demonstrated over the last three years, we've got a system and a method to do that. And then all of it lifting nicely because it's even more differentiated than before, and we continue to know how execute and practice 80/20 really, really well. Mike Halloran : Very clear. Thanks, Eric. A \u2013 Eric Ashleman : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Vlad Bystricky with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Vlad Bystricky : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my call this morning. A \u2013 Eric Ashleman : Good morning, Vlad. Abhi Khandelwal : Hey, Vlad. Vlad Bystricky : So I just wanted to dig in on FMT a bit. Just in terms of your commentary and outlook around energy there, which I think you moved from stable to market softness. So can you just talk a little bit more about the dynamics you're seeing in energy in particular and how you're thinking about whether how much election impact might be having an impact on those end markets? Or anything else that you're seeing as sort of an overhang in those? Eric Ashleman : Yes. I mean, there's -- first, there's two things here. One, I'd always kind of step back a little bit and remind people of the job we do here. We do a lot of downstream work around custody transfer. So as energy moves around the system, that's kind of where we do a lot of our work. Frankly, a lot of that is driven by things like people building trucks and laying in some infrastructure within that transportation system. We've got some overhang there from a really, really warm winter, that's probably spread over that sector throughout. We got a little bit of an artificial bump here to the downside because this was one of the businesses, you might remember, we had a consolidation -- a large-scale consolidation here a couple of years ago. This is one that if you go back in time about a year ago, we were still processing quite bit of backlog in that business. It was one of the last that we had that were kind of eating backlog that it accumulated. And so we got a bit of a comparison issue, because we're now at very standard IDEX levels of lead time and replenishment. So, there's always going to be a little bit of a calibration issue, particularly on a year-over-year basis. So I'd actually take this energy story and say, it's probably half of it that's us, half of it that is a little bit of the pressure there that you'd see in the market. And then just on the question of go forward, obviously, it's sort of an indirect relationship, but health of the energy sector overall will tend to promote CapEx deployment and all the things that eventually find their way downstream to the places where we do business. So we would prefer to have it rather than not. But to be honest, a really, really cold winter will also help, and that has very little to do with politics. Vlad Bystricky : Okay. That's helpful, Eric. Appreciate it. And then maybe just sticking with FMT. Just in terms of the stability you've seen in sort of the day rate orders, any color or commentary you can give on what you're seeing by geography and whether you're seeing any meaningful differences in domestic versus international trends? Eric Ashleman : Probably, as you suspect, I mean, North America leading the way. That's been the case now for a while, not just by a little but by a lot. I think reasonable stability in Europe. Not a lot of inflection, it moves around a little bit. It's not the bigger piece for us in this particular part of the business. I mean, we're more North American-centric anyways. And then I would say -- and when you go on the other side of the globe, that is a different story. I mean, almost anything we're doing in India right now is really, really good. I would say, China is -- while that story overall, of course, has some sobering characteristics, we've always been super surgical there. And so, it's probably trailing the pack because of where it is and what it's a part of. But we're more than holding our own, because we just -- we choose to make certain bets in certain places that are honestly they're very small, representative of the entirety of that economy. So if you're going to put them in order, probably I would say India first, but it's a smallest piece of IDEX; North America, strong, and that's driving a lot of it; Europe is stable and lagging a little bit behind. I'd probably put China at the back, but still positive for us. Vlad Bystricky : Okay. Appreciate that. Thanks. Eric Ashleman : Yes. Operator : Our next question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Sprague : Hey. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Eric Ashleman : Hi, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Eric, hi. I want to come back just to the HST orders again and sort of blanket orders starting to come in. Eric, is there anything there in sort of the number of customers, the size of the orders that actually helps kind of firm up a view into 2025? Obviously, there's got to be some normalization going on here. So just your context, right, is maybe apparently the channel inventory liquidations have run their course and maybe we're getting to some sort of normalization here. Eric Ashleman : I think even though, of course, it's a strong and sharp comparison year-over-year, when you actually dig into kind of each one of the entries, I think they're more generalized in terms of how you would interpolate them all. And you have to kind of add them all up and get some more general conclusions. But they're -- you put them all together, they are still positive. So -- and you cited one there. So the fact that these are laying in and laying in across the life science spectrum, it does tell you something about kind of a point of moving from stability towards something different. Again, the rate of advancement, the rate of inflection, still pretty vague and not really determined yet. I'd hold that up in that particular space. Just listen to comments that our teams are having with customers are the ones that are out there in the public, you hear optimism a little bit more. You hear some people talking about fleet aging and where we are in that side of the cycle, some things around consumables, which often lead the way for instruments at some point. And so there's like a little general pieces. But there is a preponderance of them on the right side the page as opposed to the last as we're kind of thinking of the space. And then if we just track over the history and sort of appreciate it quarter-to-quarter over the last year as it's walked this way, you can kind of see it building. I mean, it's a slow build and it doesn't really say what the slope is going to be at this point yet. But it's important. The inventory dynamic that you talked about, that's out there, too for HST. And reminder again, some of these are not life sciences or semi spaces. There are other ones. But those are areas of OEM-centric businesses and little higher customer concentration, and there have been some areas where those customers have had some inventory that we've been working around. And so the extent there's order patterns like this, it does suggest there too that you're further and further away from that. And then the fact that all of the reporting areas that we have, have got some level of organic health in the order side and it's uniform across the segment. Those are the kind of things again that just -- again, they're sort of rough and generalized, but they're important they're additively on the positive side of the ledger versus not. Jeff Sprague : Understood. And then maybe just coming back to China. I think your prior comments on China just a moment ago were just on -- related to FMT, I apologize if they weren't. But can you just give us kind of the big picture view on China, how it performed in the quarter? And just any context on total IDEX price in the quarter also would be helpful? Thank you. Eric Ashleman : Yes. On the first part, they're not far off, FMT versus full company because we have a lot of FMT presence there. Really that's kind of the lead segment with some things that we have in fire as well. And I would say it, put the two together, it's basically the same commentary. It's a tiny piece of a giant geography and it's kind of product line based. And so -- and we kind of move in and out depending on which way the wind is blowing. And so when we think we've got technical advantage, we go a little heavier with something that holds up better. And we generally, all of it stays in at least a positive category in an otherwise maybe not quite as positive story, again, which is still a small piece for the company, Abhi? Abhi Khandelwal : Yes. And then on the pricing question that you had, we saw about 2.3% price in the quarter and 100 basis point spread that we talked about as part of the guidance in Q2. So that's where we landed for the quarter. Eric Ashleman : And that's been holding steady, both on the side of equation, yes. Abhi Khandelwal : Yes. Jeff Sprague : Thank you for that. Have a good day. Appreciate it. Eric Ashleman : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Andrew Buscaglia with BNP Paribas. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Buscaglia : Hi. Good morning everyone. Eric Ashleman : Good morning. Andrew Buscaglia : I wanted to ask on HST. You're talking about there's still a pickup in semis. Maybe a few questions there. Just what are the customers saying, is giving you insight into that comment, why we wouldn't see that pick up sooner than midyear next year? And then have you guys discussed the margin differential across those four subsegments within HST? And how would that impact the recovery for margins going from here? Eric Ashleman : All right. Well, I'll take the first part and let Abhi chime in on the second. I mean I think from a semi perspective again, we do pretty narrow focused work there. We're involved in wafer manufacturing and fabrication and metrology, principally on really, really advanced solutions. That's where almost all of the IDEX pieces that do business do it. And I think really, it's a question of factory utilization. I mean, overall, it's until that hits certain levels and there's a catalyst identifiable that's either taken it there or looks like it's going to take it there in the near term, it just doesn't drive kind of big ticket items at a level yet that takes it up to another level. So there's been a series of pretty public announcements in that regard. I think a lot of people pointing to probably the lack of any singular big catalyst beyond, obviously, the things that are happening in AI, but that really doesn't present itself at this point in massive volume. It's more specialized. And so I think whether it's -- that's some kind of consumer gear or a return to lots of PCs that are more advanced than ever, those are the kind of things I think you'd be looking for to take and push the upper limits of those utilization rates to a point where you want to then get in line for some still pretty long lead time gear. And so given that nobody orders this kind of stuff today for delivery tomorrow, it does allow you to probably see into the future a little bit and make a projection like that. So it doesn't mean again that that's necessarily bad market for us. It's just we're kind of all waiting for the next cycle there. And we really are because we've got just an incredible amount of assets that are now positioned for it. Abhishek Khandelwal : Yeah. And so I'll take a stab of your margin question. So you kind of just think about where HST is. I mean, on a year-over-year basis, our HST margins were down 40 basis points on organic sales being down 5%, right? So I'd say it's a true testament to the work that our teams have done in rightsizing our businesses, frankly, because if you're down 5% organically and the teams didn't do the work they did to take out costs, you'd see a much higher decline on a year-over-year basis. So kudos to our team for rightsizing the size, coupled with driving productivity, coupled with the price/cost spread that we saw in the segment, right? So as you sit here today and look at a 26.5% EBITDA profile and then moving forward, what does that look like? So we announced the acquisition of Mott. We said it was low 20% EBITDA out of the gates. Then we laid out a very clear plan that demonstrates that we're going to generate 400 to 600 basis points of margin improvement in -- at Mott in the next 12 to 18 months. So when you put it all together, coupled with the organic growth coming back in the future, there's no reason for HST not to be a low 30% EBITDA business. Andrew Buscaglia : Okay. Got it. That's helpful. Maybe sticking with margins, your price cost has been good. But I feel like every few years, you guys have to navigate some sort of supply chain calamity. And with the election coming up, tariffs are now back in the news. So can you remind us like where you are with your positioning if indeed tariffs come back into the picture and how you're getting ready for that? Eric Ashleman : Well, I mean, look, I think whether it's supply chain pressure that we experienced in the pandemic or it's an item like that, thinking about supply chain resilient, every company should be and we are we're doing that, too. I will remind people, I mean, as we saw this to our advantage in the pandemic, probably would be an advantage in this environment as well. We're much more localized in terms of ideating and orders placed within the same geography where we actually produce and sell. It doesn't mean there aren't cross-border shipments on the supply and input side. There are at certain levels and certain kind of base level commodities. But we do an awful lot of work within country. So as we think of tackling it, and we're, of course, running scenarios and talking about critical inputs like anybody else, we are appreciative that kind of we built the company around a model that tends to be more localized anyways. Andrew Buscaglia : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. Brett Linzey : Hey, good morning, all. I wanted to come back to the EBITDA bridge and specifically the resource investment/discretionary, that $12 million. Fairly big step-up sequentially versus Q1. I was hoping you could just unbundle those. Is the resource investment offset by lower discretionary? Or is this discretionary going up too? And then if you could maybe speak to some of those targeted investments and the paybacks. Abhi Khandelwal : Yes, let me take the bridge item first. So if you look at the bridge that we put out there on a year-over-year basis, you're seeing a $12 million headwind tied to the question you're asking. So I'd say, a-third of that is tied to higher M&A spend on a year-over-year basis given the fact that we just did our largest transaction with Mott. So that's about a-third of it. The other third is tied to stock comps and the timing of stock comp last year and the tailwind that we saw compared to this year. And then there is some discretionary spend in here tied to customer-facing T&E and the investments that we are making tied to growth initiatives on a year-over-year basis. Brett Linzey : Okay. Appreciate that. And then maybe just shifting back to Mott. So it sounds like you're running ahead there. Good integration progress. Should we think about the 2026 accretion target or expectation getting pulled forward based on this fast start? And does that change your thinking at all? Abhi Khandelwal : Well, look, we're early days. We're six weeks in the acquisition. We're working the plans, partnering with the local teams. Our teams and the Mott teams are partnering together and laying out a plan over the next 12 months. So it's early days so it's hard to pinpoint to what 2025 versus 2026 is going to do. Eric Ashleman : I think part of what we want to convey here is that you always -- you're going to get a certain business and meet it, and then you pass the line, you close it. And of course, the reality is there. This reality is every bit as good as what we thought coming in. Abhi Khandelwal : Yeah. Eric Ashleman : And the fact that we were able to integrate some teams as fast as we are, it's an 80s acquisition for us that we're all playing in. And we see as many possibilities do. It's just a real testament. That's the early read, the early excitement, there's still an awful lot of work to do. The world's got to play out. But at least want to make sure we got that out in front of you that at this point, couldn't be happier with what we acquired. Brett Linzey : Appreciate the details. Best of luck. Eric Ashleman : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Joe Giordano : Hey, good morning, guys. I wanted to touch on the other -- some of the other more recent M&A. So for EA, you guys lowered your expectations last quarter. Just curious, how that's tracking. And then also curious on Muon just given the semi push-outs you've talked about and one of your large customers gave some disappointing orders. So just curious what the latest is on those two businesses? Abhi Khandelwal : I'm sorry. Can you talk about what EA means? I'm not sure I followed you. Apologies. Joe Giordano : Sorry, sorry. Just focus on Muon. That was my mistake there. Just Muon, given like the weakness in orders at one of your large customers? Eric Ashleman : Yeah. I mean, look, that's a piece of that business. It's not -- by no means is it all of it or even the majority of it. So -- and even there, I mean, we're -- look, that business is doing -- a portion of it is doing some pretty advanced work that's actually well ahead of machines that are being delivered today. So there's not a one-for-one kind of corollary. So there's a few things there that help out on that side of it. And ultimately, at the end, long cycle, super well positioned. It's got some presence in med tech markets that are doing well because it's exiting some inventory positions. It's got another one that's actually in a very different adjacency as well. So it's not an entirely semi-driven business that is a decent component of it, but it's well positioned and at times a little different than you might suspect in terms of the production cycle. And the other two components, I think, pretty good and holding up. And it is a piece that we're now considering with other Applied Material Science Business technology businesses we have in terms of how all of it works together, including Mott. So we'll be doing some of that work and in some ways, kind of rescaling, recasting all of it together. Joe Giordano : Interesting. Okay. And then just curious on the sequential growth in HST. You said half of it was -- roughly half of it was like actual demand. Just curious on the Life Science side. Are we talking more like bioprocessing? Or is it more lab? Just kind of which cohort of customers is really driving that? Eric Ashleman : Well, for us, it kind of almost has to be in the Analytical Instrumentation kind of course, space just because of our presence. We're not as pronounced in the bio areas. Joe Giordano : Perfect. Thanks, guys. Eric Ashleman : Thank you Operator : Our next question is from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question. Q \u2013 Rob Wertheimer : I know it's late in the call, but Eric, I was listening to your prepared remarks and the conversion of analog processes and tools to digital is something you touched on before. I don't know if your comments were slightly more broad this time. And I'm wondering if you had any further expansion on how you're evolving -- how you guys operate on the team. Thank you. Eric Ashleman : Yes. Look, it's a team that years ago was kind of harder for us to imagine across all of the smaller pieces of IDEX. But as we started to assemble scale more purposefully, actually this is one of the areas that we're applying it. And so I'll give you a couple of examples that kind of rise to the next level. Doing a lot of work on the front end of a lot of these outstanding FMT franchises, which are more fragmented, more industrial in nature, but the nature of the interactions between ourselves and end customers is more digital than ever. And as a leader in those spaces, I mean, the market is looking for us to kind of lead the way of how this work is going to be done, how does knowledge transfer happen. If somebody calls in and the looking for information, how many people has to manually intervene there versus some automated things that we can do? So we've got -- we've had for a while now, but we're starting to scale it more with some very focused initiatives to make sure that we are leading the way there like you would think a market leader would do. And you see a lot of that playing out at FMT. On the solutions side, this is not a ubiquitous solution, but you see it playing out in fire. We've talked about the automation there. It's a decent part of the growth and the strong numbers that they've put up. That's a slower to change industry, but it's starting to take and get some real traction there. And that's all about digital functionality and automation, helping solve this problem at crew size. We talked about our water businesses. At the core, all that hardware ultimately presents information that is shown digitally and is now more seamless and more integrated than it was before. So it's just -- I wanted to make sure that people appreciate that part of becoming a larger company and a little bit more thematic organization, you start to get benefits in this way. And we're participating in our own IDEX-like way. Q \u2013 Rob Wertheimer : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to hand the floor back over to Eric Ashleman for any closing comments. Eric Ashleman : Thanks so much. Thanks for everybody for joining today. I really appreciate the questions and the interest. And look, I think the bottom line here, still a choppy and uncertain world, no doubt. But we're in a good spot at IDEX. We're not out of the woods yet at HST, but it's really great to see the strong year-over-year orders comp, a modest backlog build, and the sequential orders uptick to the high point. We'll have to wait a bit, see how that recovery plays out from here. But look, I think we've strengthened our portfolio a lot as we prepare ourselves for a cycle of sunnier days ahead, no doubt, through the acquisitions. And Mott here at the end is a really good indicator of that. Our two other segments are doing really, really well with some nice pockets of growth. And execution, as always, at IDEX is strong across the board. We think the second half of the decade, which, by the way, is only two months away from starting, it's going to be a tremendous period of value creation overall for IDEX. And I really look forward to talking with you about it in the quarters to come. Thanks. Have a great day. Abhi Khandelwal : Thank you. Wendy Palacios : Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

IDEX teams maneuvered a year of choppy and uncertain macro conditions with operational focus and solid execution in 2024. We delivered innovative solutions to our customers, achieved strong product deployment, and both financial and human capital toward our largest acquisition to date, Mott. I want to thank our IDEX employees around the globe for all their contributions. Our IDEX team executed a strong finish to the year. Here are some Q4 highlights. We delivered a series of impactful projects within the Health and Science Technology segment destined for pharma, global broadband satellite communications, and energy transition verticals. We drove organic orders growth across all segments led by HST. Mott achieved strong results in their first quarter with IDEX, delivering a significant filtration systems project within their energy transition vertical. The integration is proceeding smoothly, and Mott's accretion timing is tracking ahead of our original expectations. Our fire safety and diversified product segment set another new quarterly sales record driven by strong growth of their automation programs within integrated fire systems. Reflecting on 2024, we saw three themes play out. When we started the year, there were some encouraging signs of growth, with a noticeable uptick in industrial day rates coupled with expectations at the time for accelerated interest rate easing. We saw this reflected in our 2024 Q1 orders and sales performance in pockets of our portfolio. This environment changed in late Q1 as an unexpectedly high inflation rate reduced the likelihood of rate reductions. The US election cycle with polarized potential outcomes entered the mix in the summer, and most markets settled into an uncertain but stable pattern. Finally, late in the year, we had clarity with respect to both issues as inflation moderated and a presidential candidate won the race, but the dynamic policy implications of the new administration likely moderated any near-term growth catalysts within Q4. As we begin 2025, there appears to be a climate of uncertain optimism. We're sitting on a stable business base, our inventories and lead times recalibrated back to normal levels, and a series of transformational megatrends are ready to help carry strong growth through the second half of the decade and beyond. The open questions continuing to drive near-term uncertainty all relate to the direction of U.S. trade and economic policy within an overall environment of high geopolitical tension. We'll likely have more clarity as we move through the first couple of quarters this year. Despite challenging macro conditions, we are building IDEX to outperform throughout the entirety of a cycle. Our differentiated technologies provide solutions to complex problems and growth-advantaged verticals. We continue to apply 80/20 to each business to fuel growth and productivity, that's been the heartbeat of our operating model for well over a decade. But now more than ever, we're using 80/20 at the enterprise level to drive power, scale, and focus through our portfolio of high-quality businesses. As we turn towards 2025 and beyond, I'd like to show you how far we've already come on this journey. I'm on slide four. We have more aggressively deployed capital over the last few years to build scale through thematic integration. We have also selectively pruned smaller, less growth-advantaged businesses to complement the work. Today, we have over half of IDEX revenue working together collaboratively within five groups, some formal, some building informally, to attack a handful of faster-growing markets that will benefit long-term from the secular tailwinds you see listed here. Doing it with more scale and breadth, which allow us to better leverage our overhead spend while maximizing productivity potential. This is an important strategic roadmap for our future evolution fueled by more power, more focus, more growth, to drive consistent earnings expansion. We have recently deployed the majority of our M&A capital toward businesses that deliver high-quality applications and solutions that leverage differentiated Mott is an important piece of this story, providing more access points to support fast-growing markets with an energy transition space and defense and high-performance semiconductor. Despite the dramatic market ups and downs over the last few years, we remain very committed to expanding our work within life sciences. We have long mutually beneficial partnerships with the world's best customers, and our teams continue to innovate in ways that push the frontiers of what is thought to be possible. We remain confident with the long-term growth outlook in this space. Within Intelligent Water, we built a portfolio that offers an integrated suite of digital analytics, complemented by hardware and mobile solutions that work in some of the world's most demanding environments. This helps our municipal and industrial customers meet the challenges of aging wastewater infrastructure, increasing severe weather events, and stricter regulatory requirements. Wendy Palacios : In other areas of IDEX, where the markets are more mature, Eric Ashleman : more industrial and more fragmented, we are collaborating at scale across units to also drive growth and income outperformance. In IDEX fire and safety, our automation capabilities are decreasing the response time and increasing the productivity and agility of emergency workers. We believe we are uniquely positioned with our breadth of product and innovation capabilities to drive solutions of this type. We are enjoying double-digit growth in this area, and automated solutions now make up more than 10% of platform revenue. Finally, within our largest FMT businesses, specializing in severe duty flow control, we are rapidly digitizing the front end of our businesses impacting the way we service and interact with our distributors, OEMs, and end users. This urgent work is powered by the scale and positioning of our best 80s businesses. Ultimately, the next step will deploy a common set of digital tools across all IDEX businesses to drive even higher levels of customer engagement. One last important point. Beyond support for faster growth, the collaboration and integration I'm describing here has additional potential to drive earnings expansion at IDEX. As we build larger scalable platforms and business groups, we can begin to shift vertical organizations, which stack up additively one company at a time, to more efficient horizontal frameworks that better lever our employee dollars allowing us to self-fund more growth resources, positioned very close to the customer for maximum impact. Alongside this work, we continue to push for flat organizations overall to speed decision-making, pushing to eliminate any layers that might get in the way of our utility. Higher thematic scale and integration also supports higher levels of sourcing productivity as the quantities of similar purchased commodity classes naturally increase. You'll see some early tangible benefits of this work within our guidance schedules. We have $0.43 of adjusted EPS support lined up for 2025 in these areas on top of another $0.20 at the midpoint from traditional productivity. We're well-positioned for solid margin expansion as we move the needle on organic growth. Turning to slide five. The last essential piece of our growth strategy is capital deployment. We are focused on the integration of Mott, and deepening collaborative connections across our broader portfolio to leverage Mott's highly engineered filtration technologies into new innovative solutions. At the same time, our dedicated corporate development team continues to work alongside our business leaders to build a robust and active M&A funnel. Cultivating businesses that fit the IDEX mold and have the potential. We have the pipeline, balance sheet, and free cash flow generation to keep M&A as a consistent contributor to our growth over time. With that, I'll turn it over to Abhi to discuss our financial results and guidance. Abhi Khandelwal : Thanks, Eric. Turning to the consolidated financial results on slide six. Please note all comparisons are against the prior year period unless stated otherwise. Fourth quarter orders of $817 million were up approximately 8% on a reported basis and up 5% organically. We saw orders growth across the portfolio, with HST experiencing 8% organic growth in the quarter driven by blanket order activity that will ship in 2025. FSDP had mid-single-digit organic growth and FMT had low single-digit growth. For the year, orders were up 4% overall, and up 3% organically. Our HST and FSDP segments experienced high single-digit organic growth. HST growth was driven by year-end blanket order activity in pneumatics and life sciences, combined with strong demand in both semiconductor MRO within our sealing solutions business and within global broadband satellite communications. FSDP growth was driven by the combination of strong demand from North America Fire OEMs and Fire integrated system solutions. FMT experienced a low single-digit organic decline driven by market softness in our agricultural business as well as softness in our semiconductor capital equipment vertical within our intelligent water portfolio. Fourth quarter sales of $863 million were up 9% reported and up 3% organically compared to the prior year. We experienced organic growth of 8% in FSDP and 3% in FMT. FSDP growth was driven by continued strength with North America Fire OEMs production ramp and share gain of automation programs within integrated fire systems. HST was flat organically versus the prior year. Strong execution of targeted growth initiatives tied to fuel cells, projects in pharma and global broadband satellite communications, and strong demand for semiconductor MRO, were offset by broad-based softness in life sciences, analytical instrumentation, automotive, and semiconductor capital equipment verticals. Overall, we delivered approximately $40 million of projects primarily centered in HST. Full year sales of $3.3 billion were flat overall and down 2% organically. HST contracted by 7% on an organic basis, driven by life sciences, and semiconductor cyclical market headwinds. FMT growth was flat with strength in chemicals and municipal water markets offsetting softness in agriculture and semiconductor capital equipment, within the intelligent water platform. FSDP drove low single-digit growth, bolstered by North America Fire OEM, and Fire integrated system solution demand. Fourth quarter gross margin declined 20 basis points to 42.5% on a reported basis. However, on an adjusted basis, gross margin expanded by 40 basis points as the benefit from strong price cost and operational productivity was partially offset by higher employee-related and discretionary costs and unfavorable mix and the net dilutive impact of acquisitions and divestitures. For the year, gross margin was 44.2%, ending relatively flat. Adjusted gross margin was 44.5% expanding 30 basis points. Strong price cost and improved operational productivity net of lower volume leverage were partially offset by high employee-related costs and unfavorable mix. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 26.4%, up 60 basis points. I will discuss the drivers of fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA on the next slide in a moment. On a full-year basis, adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 80 basis points to 26.7%. A bridge of the full-year adjusted EBITDA can be found in the appendix of this presentation. On a GAAP basis, our Q4 effective tax rate was 18.5% versus 22.7% in the prior year period. The full-year 2024 GAAP effective tax rate was 21.1% versus 21.7% in 2023. Both the Q4 and full-year tax rate decreases were primarily due to discrete benefits at year-end including the reduction of taxes accrued on dividends of foreign earnings and the decrease in state tax expense mainly due to the jurisdictional mix of taxable income. Fourth quarter net income was $123 million resulting in GAAP diluted EPS of $1.62. Adjusted net income was $155 million with an adjusted EPS of $2.04. For the full year, net income was $505 million resulting in EPS of $6.64. Adjusted net income was $599 million generating an EPS of $7.89, down $0.33 or 4% from last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $157 million, a decrease of 12%. We achieved a conversion rate of 101% of adjusted net income. For the year, we delivered free cash flow of $603 million, down 4% versus last year, and also coming in at 101% of adjusted net income. We achieved 3.8 in inventory turns and invested $65 million in capital expenditures. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow enabled us to pay $205 million in cash dividends to shareholders this year. We also funded the acquisition of Mott through the combination of approximately $212 million of cash and $774 million of debt. We continue to maintain our strong investment-grade rating and closed the year with a gross leverage ratio of 2.2 times. Moving on to slide seven, I will walk through the details of the adjusted EBITDA drivers. For the fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased by approximately $23 million. Our organic sales volume increased approximately 1% favorably impacted adjusted EBITDA by $2 million flowing through at prior year adjusted gross margin rate of 42.7%. Strong price cost spread of 130 basis points, and operational productivity drove $80 million of benefits year over year. In the quarter, we saw unfavorable mix, primarily in our energy and bandwidth business. We strategically invested in resources, supporting target growth initiatives, in groups such as fire and safety, and intelligent water. All these factors, combine into a favorable organic flow through of 53%. The impact of acquisitions, net of divestitures, and FX increased adjusted EBITDA by $12 million on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Now I would like to move on to our overall outlook for 2025 starting on page eight. Before diving into our full-year guidance, I want to reiterate Eric's opening comments. IDEX continues to have leading positions in attractive end markets attached to strong secular growth trends. Beyond positive economic fundamentals, we will continue to drive above-market growth through pricing power, targeted growth initiatives, competitive lead times, and customer intimacy-driven shared gains. These dynamics are demonstrated within each of our segments, and will result in better-than-market performance over the long term. For the full year 2025, we expect organic growth of 1% to 3%, with the majority of our end markets stable to grow. Within this range, we expect HST to be our highest growth segment near the high end of the range. We're expecting a modest lift within our key end markets in life sciences next and optical filters. And a second-half recovery in the semiconductor capital equipment. We will continue to see tailwinds with pharma, semiconductor MRO, space, and energy transition markets, as we experienced in Q4. For steelwinds, are supported by demand for new disease therapies, and nutrition. Global communications satellite network expansion, and energy consumption tied to data centers. Eric Ashleman : Additionally, Abhi Khandelwal : Mott's applications and capabilities enable growth acceleration with energy transition as demand for clean energy expands internationally. And traditional energy solutions grow domestically. For FMT, we expect overall segment growth closer to the lower end of the guidance range. We see the most exposure to market cyclicality in this segment. In our core industrial markets, we expect continued stability as we saw in the fourth quarter but flat to low single-digit market growth and strong price support. This stability will be tempered by energy and agriculture where we see more challenges driven by the timing of capital investments and lower levels of farm income respectively. We remain bullish with the growth in our intelligent water platform driven by continued municipal water markets investment, in wastewater management and aging infrastructure improvements, in conjunction with key project wins in our semiconductor ultra-pure water heater business. Finally, turning to our FSDP segment, we expect organic growth to be towards the midpoint of our guided range with continued strength in our fire and safety business. Our fire business has successfully deployed its integrated systems platform over the past few years and it is now more than 10% of that business. This program has increased our content per truck, which when combined with the recovering North America OEM channel has accelerated our growth. We expect the growth trajectory to continue in 2025. We expect dispensing and bandit to be up low single digits. This segment performance outlook embedded within our organic growth range of 1% to 3% equals adjusted earnings per share growth of $0.15 to $0.40 depending on top-line results including price cost in line, with IDEX's historical performance and slide portfolio mix. Additionally, we will drive operational excellence, from operational productivity more than offsetting wage inflation pressure, contributing $0.15 to $0.25 of adjusted EPS growth. We will also drive $0.43 of growth from the platform optimization and deleveraging savings that Eric already mentioned. In order to achieve these savings, we expect to take $21 to $25 million in restructuring charges during 2025 of which approximately $8 to $10 million is expected in the first quarter. These charges are primarily related to severance. The reset of variable compensation to normal levels after a challenging 2024 combined with higher share-based compensation, results in a $0.29 headwind while the impact of recent acquisition and divestitures contributes $0.24 of adjusted operating EPS growth before finance. Finally, considering a few non-operational items, the higher debt level due to the acquisition of Mott, will unfavorably impact adjusted EPS growth by $0.22. In totality, the overall impact of Mott on 2025 adjusted EPS is accretive, net of higher interest expense ahead of schedule. We expect FX to be a headwind of $0.11 in 2025. An increase in the effective tax rate on a year-over-year basis is creating a $0.14 headwind or adjusted EPS. The 2024 effective tax rate includes certain discrete events, which produced an $0.11 benefit to adjusted EPS in 2024, that will not repeat in 2025, and in addition, the projected 2025 rate of approximately 22% to 23% includes a heavier mix of improved performance in regions, with higher tax rates. Turning to slide nine, I'll provide additional details for the full-year guidance as well as the first quarter of 2025. In summary, for the full year, we expect organic revenue growth of 1% to 3%, to yield GAAP EPS of $6.56 to $6.96 and an adjusted EPS of $8.10 to $8.45, up 3% to 7% over 2024. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be in the range of 27.5% to 28%. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be about $90 million. Corporate costs are expected to be approximately $110 million up from 2024 by approximately $16 million driven by variable compensation reset, and essential compliance investments. Moving on to the first quarter. We are projecting GAAP EPS to range from $1.18 to $1.24 and adjusted EPS to range from $1.60 to $1.65. Organic revenue is expected to decline 3% to 4% compared to the prior year. And adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be in the range of 24.1% to 24.5%. Organic revenue range reflects the challenge in Q1 2024 comparable with our semiconductor agriculture, chemical, and energy end markets, which decelerated as we exited 2024. We are offsetting a portion of this pressure through positive price cost spread productivity, and our platform optimization savings, to drive an organic flow through on lower volume in the low to mid-40%. Additionally, our adjusted EPS guidance includes $0.06 of pressure versus the prior year from share-based compensation. Add additional color to our first quarter guide, from a sequential perspective versus Q4 2024, we expect to see reduced revenues resulting from $40 million of projects executed in the fourth quarter strong to a gross margin rate as well as some additional volume decline in HST due to semiconductor recovery timing and within FMT due to seasonality within ag and water. We expect pressure of $0.20 to adjusted EPS from accelerated recognition of stock compensation and variable compensation reset as we enter 2025. To close out on our guidance, I would like to provide some pacing considerations to consider as you contemplate our full-year guidance on the next slide. I'm on slide ten. Our guidance implies that revenue and adjusted EPS will be weighted to the second half of the year. In terms of revenue pacing, we expect a higher portion of our full-year sales guide to be delivered in the second half. Driven by sequential recovery of our capital equipment-related semiconductor markets, timing of water project deliveries, and March shipment timing which has historically been weighted to the latter part of the calendar year. Additionally, we expect a modest recovery within our life sciences fluidics and optical filter business, implying low single-digit organic growth for the year with revenue pacing approximately flat across the year. And industrials to show modest market growth with strong price support following historic seasonal patterns. Our targeted growth programs will have a more pronounced impact in the second half. From an adjusted EPS perspective, we expect increased adjusted EPS on higher second-half volume at historical flow-through rates. From optimization, and deleveraging benefits, as well as price cost realization reached full run rate in the third quarter of 2025. And stock compensation expense you will have an in-year first-quarter adjusted EPS impact of approximately $0.20. And a full-year impact of approximately $0.35. With that, I will turn it over to Eric for closing remarks. Eric Ashleman : Thanks, Abhi. I'm on Slide eleven. As I close our introductory remarks with an overview of our value drivers, I thought I'd provide some three-dimensional color from my Q4 travels across IDEX to help you really appreciate the quality of our company, our people, and our culture. In late November, I joined more than twenty other IDEX leaders at our Airtech business, acquired in 2021 for a week of rapid continuous improvement events to drive productivity and throughput in support of one of their fastest-growing customers. We included a cohort of large business leaders nearing graduation from the IDEX Academy's leadership excellence program. They took powerful lessons of process-driven servant leadership back to their global teams, to raise the bar on what's possible when great teams work together with full engagement. I checked in on the Mott team in late fall to see firsthand the state of integration. I was inspired as always by their incredible passion for the business as they deliver solutions to the world's most demanding problems. In many ways, it feels like they've been part of IDEX for years, not months. Finally, I traveled to India to visit our facilities and commercial teams. The manufacturing facility we opened less than two years ago near Ahmedabad is already at high levels of utilization. Producing a variety of products for dispensing and our HST material process near Bedodra at our first production campus, I got a chance to visit the secondary school we've built and staffed to support over 250 children from local communities. All of these experiences helped me really appreciate the power of our purpose. Trusted solutions improving lives. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for your questions. Operator : Done. Our confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. Our first question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Mike Halloran : Hey, good morning, everyone. Abhi Khandelwal : Hi, Mike. Good morning. Mike Halloran : So let's start with a lot of what Abhi was going through there and just help me understand the cadencing and the moving pieces a little bit more succinctly. If I think about why Q1 is so soft, and then the confidence in the remaining part of the year, obviously, let's take aside this share-based comp piece, and you just certainly the timing. So the moving pieces here are more project timing, share-based comp. Anything else you would talk to is a broad bucket. But I think the bigger part of the question is just why the confidence in some of these end markets improving as you work through the year, particularly the semi side or anything else? It's a broader question and my follow-up may be a little more succinct related to some of those, but just maybe help line that out because I know that's certainly where we're getting a lot of questions. Abhi Khandelwal : Yeah. So why don't I do this? Let me start and then I'll jump in as he sees fit, but so look, I know this Q1 topic, Q4 topic is a big topic. So let's just start first sequentially, Mike, to your point. So if you kinda think about Q4 to Q1 sequentially, as you pointed out, there's about $40 million of project in Q4. So if you think about the organic growth that you saw in Q4, $40 million of that we shipped $40 million of projects in Q4, so that organic growth is very tied to that. You know, $40 million project shipments. So when you go from Q4 to Q1, that $40 million doesn't repeat and there's about a $0.22 impact sequentially. The second thing is when you talk about share-based comp, it is actually a big topic sequentially. So from Q4 to Q1, it's a $0.20 headwind. When you look at it on a sequential basis. So if you start with the $2.04, back out the project, back out the share-based comp, about $0.42 worth of sequential. Now switching gears on you for a second, kinda talking about Q1 year over year. As you recall, when we talked about the last year at the same time, we exited Q4 into Q1 where our industrial businesses saw a positive momentum, positive inflection, and we built backlog in the exiting Q1 last year. In May, we all saw there was a the inflation reading was pretty hard. The likelihood of cutting the rate three to five times was pretty much off the table. And so what we saw in 2024, really, in the first half into the third quarter is that industrial businesses that build backlog, burn that backlog, and quite frankly carries away in 2024. The second half of 2024, Mike, is really all about the strong momentum that we saw in HST type to be orders order growth that we saw in Q3 and Q4. If you recall, Q3 was positive 20%. Q4 was positive 8%. In Q3, we saw blanket activity tied to our life sciences business and some nomadic business. And then in Q4, we saw about $40 million worth of blanket activity thirty of which is tied to a nomadic business and then some more life sciences activity. Now these are not just blanket activity or just normal orders. Right? These are brand new platforms. With specific customers that have delivery schedules throughout 2025. Okay? So that's where the confidence into the HST orders and what that means from a revenue standpoint comes from. Comes for in 2025. So what you're seeing here really is a year that's setting up a positive momentum. We closed January. We built some backlog as part of the January close. So Q1 really is a reflection as you think about Q1 coming into Q1, we have lower backlog on the industrial side. With strong momentum on the HST side as you saw it in Q3, Q4. That's really setting us up for 2025. A couple other things in the quarter year over year, we have a $0.03 headwind from FX. And then another $0.06 of headwind on the margin line tied to share-based comp and variable comp reset. So that's the color between Q4 to Q1 and then Q1 year over year. Eric Ashleman : And just a couple of things there. I think that last point that Abhi made, I mean, this is us making the turn. Where kinda HST comes back and leads the way. As it will in 2025 from a growth standpoint. That's why we've been building it. The momentum that we saw in those, you know, blankets is a Visa. That's not routine stuff. The Q4 items that we got in our pneumatics area are really really good. I mean, that's tied to, honestly, providing power for data center applications. So really strong things that again, they're unique individual customers with an individual launch rates. We know where those are and how they phase out across the year. The semi comp piece in there is the only piece we didn't really talk about. We do have a couple of customer-specific inventory adjustment pressure points in the early part of the year. That are gonna correct against themselves in the back half. And so while as always, we're kinda waiting for an overall inflection point to get to better days ahead, there is a specific point in there that does show up in phasing beginning to end. You know, so that's out there. But at the same time, you know, around that, got actually a couple of positive data points. Our ceiling solutions business within semi comm does kinda different work. And does more sort of aftermarket you know, maintenance kind of items that you use in a system when you're running it. We see that it's a nice growth in Q4. It's continuing to Q1. That's kind of a precursor at least, you know, indicative that utilization matters and run rates matter and we think is a good data point. Mike Halloran : Yeah. Got it. Alright. So if I just sum that up clearly then, it's the sequential Q4 to Q1 are actually pretty normal seasonality if you exclude the share-based comp. And you exclude the project activity. That's correct. And then the outlook for the year is also relatively normal seasonality other than how Mott is shaping up, a couple of green shoots are shaping up in your semi commentary. Is that a fair interpretation? Eric Ashleman : Yes. Alright. And then the second one, just we think about the platform optimization and delayering comments you made today. You know, maybe talk a little bit about what this means for the growth profile and for how you think about incremental margins or incremental leverage on that growth on a forward basis and just, you know, kind of frame up with the tailwind or the benefit could be from it. Eric Ashleman : So I mean, it's a pretty simple ratio. We're moving the top line, the numerator, and the denominator. And so, you know, this is stuff that we always had in mind as we're putting these pieces together, and maybe I'll kinda work it around the newer part that we're building around material science applications. But these businesses do link together thematically. They're all leveraging technologies, that are unique to each business, but are kind of pinging against the same four to five markets. So you're able to get some commercial efficiency there. You're able to kinda move from a system where kind of they call it the old IDEX way where each business sort of has to support itself in every single function. So now a couple of businesses that are able to enter intertwine either commercially or via technology, sometimes shared services in back office. And so you're getting more mass close to the customer to support growth resources and the growth mission of the company. And you're doing it in a way where actually, you know, you're moving up within the organization. That we're interfacing with in the markets that matter the most because we're bringing more power. And more mass to those. You got a chance to move the needle more on the top end you're actually able to do it a lot more efficiently from a resource perspective because you don't have to kinda string along a bunch of pearls got some unique ways to combine things and get that leverage. So you saw that play out. You're seeing it play out in the 2025 numbers. Both the top line and the bottom because most of the growth highlights we have kinda coming off that page. And a lion's share of the productivity we're delivering is in the same areas. And that's a story that isn't done. As we continue to run this out, we keep assembling the pieces, we put more scale, and we get more depth and presence with certain customer sets and markets, there's things we can do from a facilities perspective, other things along the way here. So it has always been part of how we thought about this to not only drive growth, but get the inner earnings expansion and the kicks that you want there as well by working the top and the bottom of the ratio. Mike Halloran : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vlad Bystricky with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Vlad Bystricky : Morning, guys. Morning, Tim. Thanks for taking my call. Thanks for all the color and the outlook and the phasing. I guess just stepping back in terms of the broader macroeconomic backdrop and what's assumed in your guidance. Have you made any specific assumptions relative to potential tariff impacts coming in, and what are you hearing from your customers as they're thinking about, you know, those potential impacts in this uncertain environment that you mentioned? Eric Ashleman : Look at I mean, nothing really material here in the numbers of the quarterly phasing that anticipates direction there. Because as you know, they're you know, some of it's some of it's along the lines I would've guessed. Some other pieces of it are kinda surprising and they're on off again in nature. So what I will tell you is that I just step back and say, here's how we're generally set up for anywhere this goes. We're really, really localized. Any region we do business. So the majority of the content that we are procuring and sourcing and putting into production and then selling generally happens within the same border. It's always been the model kind of before Tara. Wave one and where we are now. Now over the last five or six years, like a lot of companies, I mean, we've been more intentional about mitigating faraway you know, portions of our supply chain. We move things around. We've taken certain, you know, ratios and fractions down. It got more second sources, you know, some of that was trade war related. Some of it is COVID and that whole experience. We've done those things too. And then as always, you know, we just keep coming back to, you know, the differentiation and the boats around our franchises in frankly, the long relationships that we have, which gives us some pricing protection as things come out and it's simply unavoidable and we're delivering critical technology. So you know, we're tracking in any one of these scenarios sort of the, you know, price we might pay as an importer, where we know where that is. We know where it is if the supplier is paying it, and maybe most importantly, given our model, we know those places where if something were to come out and, you know, there was long duration, it's gonna tend to lag in through value-added steps. An example I would give you here would be electronics. We buy a lot of it from local board houses and things, but almost all of the components probably are coming from somewhere else. And so, you know, learned our we learned some things in the first wave. We know where those points are. We can understand them, potentially move things if we need to. But at the end of the day, we think we can protect it with price differentiation. So that's the general approach. We meet on it more actively as, again, I think most customers companies are. And then we're, you know, spending the time working different scenarios here. We don't have you know, at least from a North America perspective, we don't have a facility in Mexico. We have kind of a small to medium one in Canada. And again, a very localized model overall. Vlad Bystricky : Okay. That's really helpful. Eric, appreciate that. And then I just wanted to shift to capital deployment for a minute here. I know the M&A funnel update was interesting and helpful. Is there a way to think about sort of the mix of proprietary versus competitive targets in that $10 billion plus potential funnel? And are there particular businesses where you see a higher proportion of potentially larger deals that could come through? Eric Ashleman : Yeah. Well, I would still say I mean, we've got a lot of focus in areas where we've been deploying capital. So continuing to flesh out that space, the spaces within HST you know, a lot of companion technologies to the material science businesses that we put up there. I mean, a lot of there's still a decent portion of the funnel, but takes that even to another level. That's an area of interest. Proprietary transactions are very much what we're trying to drive here. Over the last few years, as we stepped up this work, we've been about an 80% proprietary level on the transactions that we've done. Work we're doing now, that's absolutely our focus. So when you talk about who's gonna go over and have that first conversation with somebody just introduce them to the concept of IDEX. As you can probably imagine, the more successful we are with, you know, bringing these transactions over the line. Gives us reference points and people that they can then talk to. Understand what that experience was like. Now, so you start to build some natural credibility and momentum as that approach plays out. So I'd love to hold that ratio if we could as we go through it. I think we've got a mix in the funnel right now that would suggest we could. And we are all spending our time in a way that supports largely proprietary transactions kind of regardless of the spaces we're looking at. I mean, these are again, we're kind of you know, we like that low on the bill of material, mission criticality component. Often not top of mind. You know, for some people. We see things a little differently. I think Mott was a good example there. We viewed that as a way that it could have some you know, interdependence with other IDEX businesses in a way that's kinda uniquely IDEX. I think we were out there and we're able to tell that story for longer than others might have been able to. So we very much wanna keep this approach. Abhi Khandelwal : And I'm glad this will be and as you know, our leverage and the capacity. So we do have the balance sheet capacity to go support M&A the way we laid out the page and still maintain our investment-grade rating. Vlad Bystricky : Great. Appreciate it. I'll get back in queue. Abhi Khandelwal : Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Nathan Jones : Good morning, everyone. Good morning. I'm gonna start off with the back on the Q1 guide and specifically the $40 million projects that shipped in the fourth quarter. Maybe I missed it. Maybe I already said it. Which of the I mean, I assume it's HST, FMT. How did that split between those segments? I'm just trying to get a better idea of you know, maybe what some core growth numbers in the fourth quarter would have been x some of these project shipments. Abhi Khandelwal : Hey, Nathan. This is Abhishek. So it's about 80% HST with a couple of projects in FMT and FSDP. But the majority of this was HST driven in Q4. Nathan Jones : And so that means then that probably the because I mean, by the same as Mike said, we're getting a lot of questions about the revenue guide in the first quarter. I think you've explained some of the earnings stuff. Any color on how you're expecting that you know, minus 3% to 4% to play out across the segments? In the first quarter of 2025? Abhi Khandelwal : Absolutely. I can give you that, Nathan. So think of FMT kinda going back to my backlog conversation I just had. You know, starting the year. FMT is gonna be down mid-single digit. With HST low single digit to mid-single digit decline and FSDP up low single digit. That's how we have laid out this guide to get to 3% to 4% decline. Nathan Jones : That's helpful. Thanks. And then I wanted to talk a little bit more about actually, slide four or slide five with the leveraging scale to drive growth and earnings. Eric, you've given some color there around, you know, some of the initiatives. I was hoping to dig a little bit more some of the financial impacts I mean, when you're talking about supply chain leverage, that should show up in gross margins, and you're also talking about SG&A leverage here. Over time, how does that contribute to the financial performance of the business? Like, I mean, you must have in your model some way some expectations of know, this had 20 basis points to gross margins a year or 20 basis points to SG&A leverage a year. Just how we should think about how that moves the needle for IDEX from a financial perspective. Abhi Khandelwal : Yeah, Nathan. So the best way to think about it is kinda going back to what we've been talking about over the last, you know, twelve months, which is really thinking about EBITDA margins here. So if you kind of think about HSD long term, what we've laid out, is a low to mid-30% EBITDA business in HST. So as you start to think about the work we're doing around delevering, around from, you know, platform optimization and building scale, you should expect to see that SG&A benefit. Expect to see that gross margin benefit because the cost is not just in SG&A, it's also above, you know, in the gross margin line. So you should start to see the margin needle move. And you should expect HSD to get to low to mid-30% EBITDA business. And then FMT, you know, is already north of 30 and then FSDP to be closer to 30% EBITDA. Eric Ashleman : I mean, we you know, I know you got Eric Ashleman : one example here, we talked a little bit, you know, we brought Mott on board. And talked about where it kinda came in from an EBITDA perspective and how we're gonna help them aggressively start to boost it. I mean, some of what we're talking about here is how that work is done. You're sharper on the front end. 80/20 says you're localizing around your highest margin products for the kind of the four to the franchises, and you're moving those the most with the most consequence, great drop-down contribution margin when you do that. Now you're super careful about where you're sort of leveraging resources elsewhere, what's needed to run a business within a company like IDEX, to get that bottom line pickup as well. It's early days in some of the things we're doing in sourcing that you know, just to get your head around it, if you start to think about it over time, you put lots and lots and lots in optics franchises together that find a lot of the same base level materials. And we're kind of seeing that in each one of these areas. Whether it's castings in one or optics in another, motors in a third. You can start to you can approach that in a very different way. Nathan Jones : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I'll get back in the queue. Abhi Khandelwal : Yep. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey. Just for starters, I appreciate all the specifics. On the first quarter guide. You know, we were all in a bit of a vacuum with the release, and it was very helpful to hear the specifics this morning. But that was probably the bulk of our questions that we were getting before the call. But I appreciate how you've bridged that for us. And so first question is and this has ever been a time to kinda plum what you're seeing in terms of tone of business, it seems now. You know, last quarter, it was election uncertainty that seems to have been replaced with policy uncertainty. Yep. And but at the end, you have got great indicators in terms of sentiment that your customers on a short cycle stop. So what are the Bellwether businesses telling you? And related when we ask about blanket orders. But the return of them is a positive that your key customers are giving you that kind of line of sight. So is that also part of a tone of business? And are you gonna calibrate that for us? Abhi Khandelwal : Yeah. No. I thanks for the questions and the Eric Ashleman : comments in the beginning there. Mean, so let's start over on the more industrial side of this. The thing where we're closer to consumption. I mean, I would say so that's that has been very stable. It was stable all last year. I mean, even though as I said in my comments, we got some certainty around candidate selection in Q4. I mean, you don't really see a bounce necessarily because it very quickly went into the other area, which you mentioned, which is of the, you know, many policies that are being suggested are likely to play out and can everybody get their head around whether that's good, bad, negative, indifferent, all of those things? Reason I called it uncertain optimism is I do think in most of those conversations, you are seeing people sort of lean forward saying, I think it's gonna be a good business environment. Like, we're having more discussions about future projects, we're being asked to think and consider and quote on some things even in those industrial spaces that can we work two or three quarters ago. And so I think I think that's a positive. That being said, it's not like they're running the system higher. The factories are not working extra shifts. We're not really seeing that yet. So it's a more positive environment, I think. I think really would like to get some clarity on where we need to go. Again, we're kinda set up to deal with either one of those swim lines. It would just be nice to know which one we're likely to get. I think that's on the industrial side. I think your pointing at the blankets is super important because that is kind of a different world. And it's reflective of why we've spent so much time trying to build our critical mass in some of these HST markets. I'll pick a couple so you can kinda get your head around it. We're doing a lot of work around the space side of things. Not a huge part of IDEX today, but its growth potential is really high. So the conversations when you're talking about people that are in that space, it's not about what's the policy and, you know, where are interest rates going. It's hey, how many people are gonna be shooting rockets up into the atmosphere? How many people wanna play with communication satellites? Are they gonna be able to get payloads at another level? And so when we're getting orders and positions on solutions in those areas, what's your annuity streams? That I don't think are subject to some of the distortions you know, month to month, quarter to quarter that we've seen in some of the other areas of the business. So there's one example. I mean, I think we have others in some of the things we're doing. We've got good. Things going on in pharma. The Mott solution that we talked about in Q4 that they delivered, it's the first time that work's ever been done. Abhi Khandelwal : Yeah. I'm sure Eric Ashleman : a lot of this work and those orders and those order positions and the things that we're putting out there are about settings. Specification points for evolving markets that I think are a little less dependent. On some of the ups and downs and sideways of, you know, kinda news of the day. And so I mean, we're really encouraged you can tell, by those Q3 brackets, the Q4 because the numbers are good, but largely what they represent, and how they position us for the years to come. Abhi Khandelwal : And Dean, just to add to that, when we talk about Blended, more on the more for the near term above and beyond what Eric also said. It does those bankers that we're talking about have specific ship dates in 2025. So they are they're gonna get shipped in 2025. Of course, you know, once you book a blank, it doesn't get shipped on January first. But they have delivery schedules tied to it. Throughout the year that we're gonna get you know, get the product out the door. Deane Dray : That's really helpful. And second question, and I might have missed it in the 2025 assumptions. It are growth investments. That's always a lever that you have. It's a way of investing for the future, Eric Ashleman : Yep. Deane Dray : Page four probably had a number of those growth and best in 2025, and what was that number? And in 2024? Eric Ashleman : Well, this is just kind of an interesting one because in many ways, they don't stick out. In ways that they have before as a bridge item. Because in as I said in the comments here, we've largely self-funded a lot of the growth investments within those five areas that we talked about. We have a net productivity benefit because if we've been able to resource lever but that's sort of after the fact of us building some scalable mass as we go out some of these spaces. So I guess it's because of the way that this architecture is being built that we've actually got more natural productivity, so you have to look less at it. There are some exceptions around the edges, but you're actually getting more power underneath the hood than is showing as an exceptional bridge item because of that work. Correct. Deane Dray : Appreciate all that color. Thank you. Abhi Khandelwal : Thanks, Dan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with TD Callen. Please proceed with your question. Joe Giordano : Just to start on the projects that you got, the $40 million. Was that contemplated when you gave when you guys reported Q3, was that contemplated originally in the fourth quarter or is that kind of a pull-in? Because I'm just curious you got to the low end of the organic guide for the quarter, but the margin was below the low end. So just what if any of that was expected? Abhi Khandelwal : Yeah. So, Joe, when we guided Q4 as part of the Q3 call, we were very, very specific around the project delivery that we're expecting in Q4. In fact, the exact language that we use around it was, hey, if you think about Q3 to Q4 ramp, the businesses in general are stable. And sequentially flat. And on top of it, what you have is project activity that we're gonna see from Q3 to Q4. So we specifically called it out as part of our guidance. Joe Giordano : Okay. And then if I look at the bridge I think that's obviously where all the confusion is with people today. I thought you said that I have a cup kind of a couple embedded questions here. Like, on semi, I thought you said that it decelerated out of Q4, and now it sounds like that's a major part of the acceleration in the second half of the year. So maybe if you can dig in there, on like, where and semi are you talking about, whether it's memory or other things, and then, like, the life science, how does that play with NIH? Potential defunding and, like, export restrictions on tools and things like that. How I guess, I'm getting, like, how much of that ramp is you know, secured with firm orders, or is it just an expectation of a market change? Eric Ashleman : Yeah. So the two areas that you talked about on this on the semi side, we kinda have two pieces of it. On the positive side, in our ceiling solutions business, the smaller percentage, but that was positive in Q4. It remains positive in Q1. And it's kind of think of it as like MRO aftermarket business kind of a wearable item that you're using as you maintain the system. So we're calling that out. It's not the major driver, but it's important because it is positive in some ways we think it's a precursor of days ahead. The more impactful disruption is in the first half of the year here and sitting in the first quarter. This is on the kind of tool equipment side where we do the lion's share of the rest of our work. I mean, we do have some inventory adjustments that are being taken probably for some of those because of those impacts, so those economic variables or political variables that you talked about, that we know is happening. And so we've got kind of a phenomenon where we pause a bit inside the business for that part of what we deliver in semi, and then we pick it up again in the second half of the year. Not necessarily a market effect. It's more of a discrete customer item that we know about. The third item that I was talking about from our long-range support is we're seeing very good commercial activity around the kind of ragged edge of the spectrum where we do a lot of the work that ultimately supports future run out towards 2030 and beyond. So kinda got near term, positive, we got this bump in existing programs where we have to navigate that first half to second half and then we've got some long-term indicators that actually we think are really positive. Eric Ashleman : On the life science side, you know, you talked through some of those things. Look, we see low single-digit to mid-single-digit lift in that kind of core fluidics handling franchise that we have around animal analytical instrumentation, within all life science stuff, good stuff within optical filters, which we have a life science component that's tucked in there. Offset a little bit by some of the work that we do around genomics. That is tied a little bit more to some of the uncertainty around government funding. A lot of that's used for population surveillance and those things. But a net positive overall as we run through the year and what we see and what we call H and S are life sciences. Joe Giordano : Thanks, guys. Abhi Khandelwal : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. Brett Linzey : Hey, good morning all. Thanks. First question just on price cost. Can you just clarify within that $0.15 to $0.40 that's organic, how much are you embedding for price cost? And then any context on the phasing through the year? Is it negative in the first quarter and you catch up? Any context would be good. Abhi Khandelwal : Absolutely, Brett. I can answer that for you. So when you think about price cost, spread that we've laid out in this guide, I've laid out about 60 to 80 basis points of price cost spread in the guide. If you think about phasing on the pricing piece, first half to second half, I've said it's about incremental $10 million of pricing in the back half of the year because if you really think to the pricing mechanism and how we do it, typically announce our pricing increase that goes into effect in Q1. So there's a quarter worth of lag. So think of it as first half to second half about an incremental $10 million on price you should expect to see. But we don't have a negative position. No. It's positive 60 to 80 basis points spread for the year. Yeah. And Eric Ashleman : Yeah. Brett Linzey : Okay. Great. You know, I appreciate the color there. And then just a question on HST and this in slide thirteen. So you indicated that the challenging comparable in life science and analytical as an offset to strength elsewhere. Just a little bit of context there, I guess, on the moving pieces. I thought orders were down about 19% and sales pretty soft. I don't know if that suggests that life science and analytical was up in the prior quarter. Just any color would be great. Abhi Khandelwal : I'm sorry, but try that question again. I'm not sure. I completely followed you. Brett Linzey : Oh, on slide thirteen, you said that you had noted a challenging comparable in life science and analytical instrumentation was an offset to strength elsewhere. I guess, was that a Q4 comment? I know Q4 2023 HST was down pretty significantly. So just wanted to square the moving pieces within the divisions. Abhi Khandelwal : Yeah. So look, I think if you think about Q4 2023 and Q4 2024 for life sciences has been pretty much flat sequentially. If I kind of take a look at our sales and where we've been in the last four quarters in 2024, it's pretty much similar. Throughout the year. While they have been flat on a year-over-year basis, there has still been pressure on the life sciences side. From 2024 to 2023. So that's what we're talking about when we say we've always talked about life science in the context of 2024 being, hey. Sequentially, we have seen a flat top line, but on a year-over-year basis, it's still down. Brett Linzey : Okay. Great. Appreciate the detail. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with BNP Paribas. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Buscaglia : Hey. Good morning, guys. Abhi Khandelwal : Morning. Andrew Buscaglia : So yeah, I had a kinda high-level strategic question I wanted to ask. And that know, HST has really come it's really not come back the way we thought it would, and it had a good year out of COVID or good two years. It's been a long time since we really seen that growth pick up, and it seems to be you know, quite a long cycle business. I'm wondering, you know, does this inform kinda where you wanna go with this segment in terms of strategic acquisitions? Has it surprised you how long cycle and how tough it's been? And if you could just comment, like, is that a fair criticism in that it it's much more longer than we when we thought. Eric Ashleman : Well, I mean, longer cycle would kind of, I think, imply that there's a consistent wave and it's gonna come around again and again and again. I that I wouldn't agree with. I think know, what what is surprising is probably the impact and the duration. And you know, just overall numbers involved on the sort of COVID post-COVID run-up and rundown. On two sectors of that segment that formed half of it. Yep. Originally. Now that percentage is actually lower today as we've acquired things in mean, we're acquiring them in different spaces. Mott alone with its focus on energy transition starts to take those levels down. They're not as critical as they were. Just singly with two dimensions. But, you know, I go back and say, you know, in hindsight, it all looks totally rational, but you had a global health event. So the very sector that was involved in trying to keep people safe and mean, got max funding, max velocity, and was really, really hot. And, yeah, it was a little surprising in how long it took the, you know, multi-years to recalibrate itself back and find its footing again. But the dynamics of that market, they don't I don't think they're changed. I mean, we still got tremendous challenges out there in terms of health events and things that we're trying to crack the code and figure out you know, we're winning and that the platforms that we're working on today, I mean, are gonna ultimately make life a lot better for people as we go forward. So don't think that these has changed, it's on the back end of a very, very singular event. That in itself was held you know, health consequential and driven. Right next to it was the semi side of it. Everybody went from working here to working at their house. They all bought PCs, and it's been a long time since they've needed new ones. And so you got two things that were half of our segment that I still think Alcentomite always has a certain amount of cyclicality, and we're always gonna be careful to keep that ratio reasonable within IDEX, I think the two of them together the duration of it and what caused it, was pretty exceptional. And I think, you know, what's important to realize here is while it we're actually seeing the swing. We're seeing the swing now where HST comes back. Our 2025 guidance has it leading the way in growth for IDEX. That's a position we should expect it to remain in. And I think we're going to see less and less and less of any of those echoes and ripples. And now, frankly, very, very exciting days ahead. Andrew Buscaglia : Yeah. And just a similar question with FMT. I would think that that would be recovering pretty strongly this year. And it seems as though kinda similarly, it seems like the not a short cycle either. It's something changed in that business where you're finding your I don't know. More of these long-duration projects than you used to be in the past. Eric Ashleman : No. I mean, largely the FMT when taken entirely, doesn't have a lot of projects in it. We talk about it. They're usually in kind of our chemical spaces, energy. That's where you see a couple of them. It's been a fragmented space that's, you know, reflective of general industry. That's why it tends to oscillate pretty fast. We referenced frankly pretty dramatic up down into 2024 as the know, the world dialed in differently. I think, you know, what you're seeing there with kinda FMT being in sort of a third place positioning for growth in the current you know, environment. Is the uncertainty that we talked about with Dean playing out mean, we're looking for direction on policy and things that you know, get some of those conversations that I referenced to turn into commitments, orders, and positions. When that happens at IDEX, we typically chase it pretty quick and ramp it up. Andrew Buscaglia : Yeah. Okay. Alright. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, our final question this morning comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question. Rob Wertheimer : Hi. Thanks for the question. I wanted to follow up on where you were going a minute ago, Eric. I mean, if you look at obviously HST, you cited the sources of the volatility, both up and down. And if you look across the trend line, you know, and I know the business has changed, but do you think that they're that we're back to normal there and, as you mentioned, that we're to resume growth, is there any you know, reversion to mean upwards versus maybe a higher trend line growth you would expect from that segment? That's my first question. Thanks. Eric Ashleman : Yeah. No. I well, like, I think I think we're heading in deposit territory. We're careful on the life science you know, recovery and the lift that we're talking about here. I don't think it's a snapback kind of thing. Ultimately, that should be more, you know, growing at higher levels, than even what we have projected in here. But we're kind of following the moderate trend lines to move away from where we've been to where we're going. We think long term, I mean, that has tremendous growth prospects. It should be a mid-single-digit at a minimum kind of franchise for us. We're just being pretty careful and moderate about our projections as we start to approach that. In the semi side, I think we're conservative there as well. We're seeing some good things. We're seeing obviously, we've got the item I mentioned internally was customer positioning here. But generally, we see that we're closer to where that next cycle is gonna be. We're super well positioned in terms of how we're represented across critical technology. I think that's gonna be an important component. Those two things where we typically just spent the bulk of our time talking about HST when we get here as I said, they used to be half the segments. They're actually lower now. Things that Mott is doing and delivering within energy transitions or great work around their the water franchise that they have with inside that business. You're gonna start to hear some things as those come out. We're gonna be talking about those more. It's gonna be a more balanced suite. Product. And, again, I think you know, most of our reasons we like it is it's not as dependent on some of the you know, temporal shift in mood and things because these are fast-evolving applications that are moving pretty rapidly from phase one to phase two of their own evolution. So being there first is really, really important and exciting. Rob Wertheimer : Okay. I'll stop there. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question and answer. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Ashleman for any final comments. Eric Ashleman : Thanks. Thanks for joining today. Appreciate all the other quick questions and the interest. As always. I'll probably conclude with some comments that are gonna echo some of the things we talked about, but I wanna make sure that we end with them here. We're at an important inflection point for IDEX. As we began to be bringing together some of these recently acquired businesses with select legacy businesses that we've long had to build scale and power in the focus that I talked about on slide four. You see that that's, you know, that's set up to deliver and starting to deliver nice growth on the top line and then some really, really nice productivity and leverage on the bottom. So working both sides of this ratio, we think, is really important. And we're now watching HST make that transition and that swing from a tough couple of years. We talked about why that happened. You know, to being back out in the lead, is we, you know, leading the way for growth for IDEX. And again, and I like the conversation we had with Dean. I mean, you know, blanket orders, their numbers, they're important, they help with the comps. Each one of them has a story. And the story that you see there is in many cases entry points into some of the best applications that we're gonna be talking about for the next five to ten years. And really, really important that we get out there super innovative, first to get there. To see Mott contributing in that way this early as part of the company, really, really provide some nice energy. Not leaving FMT and FSDP behind. Didn't touch on it much here today, but, you know, that point around digitization and automation being able to apply that at scale. That's an important milestone and a threshold. I don't wanna lose sight of that either. But end of the day, we think we're building something special here. We are excited to keep talking about it with you along the way, and I look forward to the next time we get to do it. Have a great day. Abhi Khandelwal : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Operator : You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
