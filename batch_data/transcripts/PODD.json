Duane DeSisto : Thanks, Brian. Good afternoon everyone, thank you for joining us today. We are pleased to report that 2014 is off to a strong start with first quarter revenue up 21% year-over-over to $69.2 million. Despite typical first quarter challenges such as the resetting of patient deductibles, OmniPod revenue accelerated by more than 35% compared to the first quarter of 2013 resulting from stronger than expected international sales. Recently, Insulet reported an increase of 117% year-over-year in their diabetes direct business driven primarily by the sales of the OmniPod. They also noted that the OmniPod has achieved market share north of 10% in key countries such as the Netherlands, Switzerland and in the UK. With aggressive growth plans in place in these markets as well as other countries such as Germany, the Nordics and Italy, we continue to expect our international business to more than double in 2014. The new OmniPod reached its one-year anniversary in the first quarter and we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the overall results, the smaller, lighter OmniPod has resonated with patients, especially those who have never used an insulin pump before. Our patch style pump the no cumbersome tubing continues to attract new customers that\u2019s over 70% of our new starts in the first quarter who are new to insulin pump. Also consistent with previous periods, our fastest growing segment continues to be patients under the age of 18. As anticipated, new patient starts in the first quarter slowed to a rate of about 20% year-over-year. However, initial shipments have increased significantly in the second quarter running at over 40% higher rate than at the same point in the first quarter. We remained confident that we will see year-over-year new patient growth north of 25% in 2014. That confidence is driven by the addition of so many new healthcare practices to our prescriber base. Since launched, new doctors accounted for over 35% of the total prescribers. And we are very happy to report that approximately 70% of these new prescribers have already come back to us with additional orders demonstrating their happiness with the OmniPod product and our level of service. And we are dedicated going forward to continuing to support them at levels they expect. With these new doctors already showing commitment to the OmniPod, the time is right for us to expand the commercial team. This expansion will ensure we are providing an appropriate level of support to engender long-term relationships. We have spent a significant amount of time evaluating our territories to understand the relationships between territory, managers, nurse educators and our key healthcare practices. What is clear is that to best serve our target practices our commercial team members need to have a recurring presence in their offices. To maintain this level of support, we hired a third commercial team member, a key account manager to the team in several territories. These new key account managers are helping the teams maintain the vital day-to-day relationship with key prescribers. While our territory managers can continue to open and serve new practices. To-date, we\u2019ve added approximately 15 key account managers to commercial team and we expect to add another five to 10 in the coming couple of months. We believe this commercial expansion will pay off quickly. We chose to expand the teams mainly in a highest performing territories and believe that the additional resources will provide our existing teams more bandwidth to drive further adoption. Critical to our commercial success is our ability to produce the OmniPod in increasing quantities. With a year\u2019s worth of experience behind us, we have made significant progress regarding the consistency of our manufacturing process for the new OmniPod. Our daily production has become much more predictable and our tolerance is better defined. In the first quarter, we made approximately $2. 6 million OmiPods, a slight increase over the fourth quarter. We achieved this level of production despite a two-week shutdown for the Chinese New Year and our performance reflect continued efficiencies gain in manufacturing. Inventory levels have increased significantly as compared to the last half of 2013. Quality levels have improved and scrap costs, which remained higher than planned in the first quarter, have started to decrease. We continue to build approximately 40,000 OmniPods per day or approximately 1 million OmniPods per month plus all three manufacturing lines. In addition, our fourth manufacturing line is progressing as planned and all equipment should be in place in the third quarter of the year, boosting capacity to nearly 1.4 million OmniPods per month. Our U.S.-based OmniPod gross margins improved to the high 50s in the quarter and will continue to improve in the second quarter as scrap costs have reduced. On a consolidated basis, gross margins improved by about 350 basis points year-over-year year and will remain relatively flat with last quarter as lower margin international revenues offset the U.S.-based revenues. Based on our current assumptions, we expect U.S. margins to reach 60% and consolidated gross margins to reach 50% in the second quarter. We take great pride in being the innovative leader in the diabetes pumping market and are investing in R&D accordingly. As we discussed last quarter, we have a very robust pipeline of initiatives across type 1 and type 2 diabetes and we continually explore collaborations in new target markets for our unique, improved and pod-based drug delivery technology. Let me provide you some brief updates. As you know, we partnered with LifeScan to integrate this OneTouch Verio Blood Glucose Meter into our PDM and submitted the combined price to the FDA for 510(k) clearance earlier this year. We have received initial feedback to our submission and are working collaboratively with LifeScan to respond to the agency\u2019s questions and comments. Our development of the OmniPod to be used in combination with Eli Lilly\u2019s Humulin U-500 Insulin is also progressing on schedule. We have finished our first round of human factory testing. We remain on track to file 510(k) approval later this year. As we\u2019ve discussed over the past year, our development efforts under this collaboration are focused on modifying our PDM for delivery of this concentrated insulin while Lilly works with regulators to update its labeling for use of the OmniPod. As type 2 diabetes gains more attention due to higher diagnosis rates and its impact on rising healthcare costs, we believe the acceptance of public therapy as treatment option will continue to increase. Target market for this combined product is a subset of people with highly insulin-resistant form of type 2 diabetes. We believe this type 2 product is a real opportunity with potentially to nearly double our reachable market. We continue to make significant progress on our initiative to integrate a continuous glucose sensor to the OmniPod. As we mentioned on our last call, we have found a viable solution to the sterilization challenges that delayed us in 2013. We also have recently completed the testing for a pain study focused on various insertion concepts. We are working to compile the data to this study now, but early indications are that various approaches around cannula insertion are viable options. The path to an improved product is a long one, but we\u2019re making strides in the right direction. Once approved, we believe this is a game changer in the type 1 diabetes market With the OmniPod being the only approved patch style pump on the market for people with type 1 diabetes, integrating CGM into the pod will only set us further ahead of anyone trying to enter the space. The OmniPod is the only pump on the market where the electronics, insertion and battery power to allow for incorporation and sensor into the on-body space. Approximately 25% of our existing patient base uses continuous sensing today and we believe this number could grow dramatically when we\u2019re able to provide them with an all in one solution. Finally, we have commenced a project for the development of a new hand-held control of the OmniPod System. We believe this next generation device will allow our customers innovative hand-held that will mesh with our innovative OmniPod. We remain on track as we see (indiscernible) American Diabetes Association conference next year and look forward to sharing additional details with you in the coming quarters. Outside of diabetes we continue to support our existing partnerships with Xeris Pharmaceuticals and with Amgen. We are working closely with Amgen in an anticipation of an approval later this calendar year and expecting to launch soon thereafter. We believe that the OminPod has the potential to be a platform technology that can deliver many types of growth in various disease areas. We continue to see other project in such areas as oncology, obesity and Parkinson\u2019s to name a few. In summary, we are very pleased with our first quarter results, revenue growth were strong in first quarter as OmniPod and consolidated revenue accelerated on a year-over-year basis for 2013. However, with the addition of approximately 15 new key account managers to our commercial team we are excited of what is ahead. As I mentioned earlier, new patient starts to run more than 40% higher than at the same point in the first quarter. And new resources are just getting into the field. With the incremental resources and increased bandwidth we expect that we would be able to drive deeper penetration across our new healthcare practices as well as we continue to add more new doctors. With a full pipeline of opportunities, we are building the foundation which will continue to drive strong growth over years to come. And finally the gross margins improvement we expect to return to operating profitability in the second quarter and will be operating profitable for the full year of 2014. With that I will turn the call over to Brian. Brian K. Roberts: Thank you, Duane. Consolidated revenue increased by 21% year-over-year to $69.2 million from $57.4 million last year. As Duane mentioned typically the first quarter is our slowest of the year as patient deductibles reset and many new customers from the fourth quarter delay their initial training. Additionally, our first quarter results include a reduction of over $4 million in Neighborhood Diabetes testing supply revenue compared to the first quarter of last year related to the impact of Medicare competitive biddings which took effect on July 1. Adjusting for the impact of competitive bidding year-over-year revenue growth in the quarter would have been near 30%. Driven by higher than expected international revenue in the quarter OmniPod revenue surged over 35% compared with the first quarter of 2013. Gross profit increased by 30% in the first quarter to $32.8 million, as compared to gross profit of $25.2 million in the first quarter of last year. Gross margins increased by about 350 basis points, 47% in the first quarter, compared to the prior year. Subsequently \u2013 sequentially gross margins remained relatively flat as a result of lower margin international revenue, the absorption of remaining costs associated with the transition of the customer base and higher than planned scrap which offset the savings achieved on the Pod. The cost for OmniPod will continue to decrease and we remain confident that we will achieve the U.S based margins in the low to mid 60\u2019s in the coming quarters. We expect consolidated gross margin to reach 50% in Q2 as well. Operating expenses increased by $3.3 million or 11% year-over-year to $34.7million in the first quarter from $31.4 million in the first quarter of 2013. This increase is primarily a result of increased stock-based compensation expense. As we noted in our Q4 call, we expect operating expenses in the range of $36 million to $38 million per quarter for Q2 through Q4, the selecting the investment team to the sales and marketing functions. Operating loss was $1.9 million in the first quarter of 2014, compared to $6.2 million in the prior year, an improvement of $4.3 million or approximately 70%. Excluding non cash expenses such as depreciation amortization and stock based compensation we generated an operating profit of $5.5 million in the quarter. We anticipate returning to operating profitability in the second quarter as revenues increased and gross margins improved. Interest and other expenses $4.2 million in the first quarter of 2014 and $4.3 million in the first quarter of 2013, approximately $2.85 million of this expense is non-cash. Our net loss for the first quarter of 2014 was $6.1 million or $0.11 per share as compared to a net loss of $10.7 million or $0.20 per share for the first quarter of last year. Our cash and cash equivalents balance was $145.6 million at March 31 compared to $149.7 million at December 31. Our net spend was approximately $4 million in the first quarter, mainly as a result of timing of accounts receivable, inventory and the payout of employee bonuses in March. As of March 31, we had approximately 55.3 million common shares outstanding. As Duane noted, we\u2019re pleased with our performance in the first quarter and have high hopes for the remainder of the year will bring. We remain confident, especially in light of the number of new healthcare practices added to the prescribing base as well as with the addition of 20 new sales resources you will see new patient starts grow 25% year-over-year. New shipments are up over 40% in the second quarter as compared to Q1. Further the operating team\u2019s hard work to reduce the bill of materials and improve efficiencies is paying off in a more cost effective PODD. Consolidated gross margin should reach 50% and the U.S. margin should surpass 60% in the second quarter. Finally, we expect our international business to remain strong in the second quarter and throughout the year. Taking all of this into consideration, we expect second quarter revenues to be in the range of $70 million to $74 million and we remain unchanged with our full year expectations of $295 million to $315 million. As always, our highest degree of confidence is to the midpoint of these guidance ranges. And with that let me turn the call back over to Duane. Duane DeSisto : Thanks Brian. In summary, our tubeless insulin pump gives our customers the freedom, discretion and lifestyle they want by providing them with the best-in-class therapy. Our 2014 focus is primarily on growing our existing business with our current product offering. While execution commercially and operationally this year key to our success, we are also continuing to develop the next-generation of products across type 1, type 2 and other drug delivery. We remain committed to innovation and development and our future enhancements, product offerings, and entry into additional therapies will allow us to maintain our competitive advantage over anyone in the patch pump space. And with that, operator, please open the call for questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Danielle Antalffy Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Danielle J. Antalffy \u2013 Leerink Partners LLC : Thanks so much. Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the question. Brian, maybe this question is for you as we think about the commentary you made in the second quarter thus far and the additional sales team adds. How do we think about that relative share guidance, I mean is fiscal guidance but it is a modest growth deceleration versus guidance for the first quarter and the first quarter is a seasonally weak quarter I\u2019m looking at guidance \u2013 the second quarter guidance at about growth of 16% to 23%, which not trying to complain, but just trying to put it the context of first is seasonally weak. You have the incremental sales force folks that hit the ground running in April. You\u2019ve given positive commentary on new patient starts, so are you just being overly conservative there, and, if so, why? Brian K. Roberts: Hi Danielle, how are you? I think it\u2019s a combination of a couple of things. One, we mentioned a couple of times in the script that international revenues were a little stronger than planned in the first quarter. Our expectations are those will probably level off a little bit in the second quarter, just a little bit of timing for which they were taking their shipments and again there is a little bit of catch up related to the end of last year that you guys will recall as we planned around the shutdown in January for Chinese New Year. So there is a little bit of a timing difference, I think it\u2019s the midpoint of the guidance range that we provided.  : So I think all in, we are very confident, very bullish about where they year is tracking. New patients, start so far this quarter being up over 40% from where we were at this point in mid-February, I think it\u2019s a big plus for us, and now we\u2019re just going to see where the rest of the quarter delivers both around the U.S. base and then exactly what international will be in Q2. Danielle J. Antalffy \u2013 Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then on gross margins, Brian, it looks like you\u2019re getting very solid gross margins on the OmniPod itself, but obviously some dilution from Neighborhood. You guys came in a little bit below what you were looking for, so you might be missing something here, but could you talk about the cadence of the gross margin ramp as we move through the year so that we don\u2019t get ahead of ourselves here given the fact that there is the dilution from Neighborhood. Maybe help us understand how the consolidated gross margin could look as we move through the year? Brian K. Roberts:  Yes, sure. So again I think there is a couple of contributing factors to overall gross margin Q1. The two being is the mix with international because certainly international is at a much lower gross margin for us, but frankly most of that gross margin turns right in the operating margin. So it still remains most profitable piece of our business today. And second as you talked neighborhood diabetes has experienced some, I\u2019d say some pricing erosion around testing supplies as contracts start to renew. Certainly nowhere near as dramatic as what we saw with competitive bidding, but there is, on the edge, there is certainly been a few margin points that have escaped there. I think from a modeling side going forward, we are looking to be 50% plus here in the second quarter. And then I would expect that we can add a couple of 100 basis points call it 200 to 300 basis points per quarter in the back half of the year each quarter, so that would get us somewhere around a 54 or 55 consolidated by the end of 2014. Danielle J. Antalffy \u2013 Leerink Partners LLC :  Got it. Okay, thank you so much. Operator :  Our next question comes from Bill Plovanic from Canaccord. Please go ahead. Bill J. Plovanic \u2013 Canaccord Genuity, Inc.:  Great, thanks good evening. Can you hear me, okay. Duane DeSisto :  Hey, Bill, how are you? Bill J. Plovanic \u2013 Canaccord Genuity, Inc.:  Good, good. Thank you, gentlemen. A couple of things. One is on the international, if I remember correctly, you had some backlog. You\u2019ve talked about that a little. Have you burned off \u2013 it\u2019s not just international, but even in the U.S., have you built up enough inventory that you\u2019ve supplied all that backlog to this point? Duane DeSisto :  Yes, I think consistent with what we\u2019ve talked about the last couple of quarters, that backlog that was originally built up at the end of Q3, we\u2019ve talked about being effectively, using your words burned off in the course of both Q4 and Q1 and we\u2019ve achieved that. So, Pat Ryan our new COO has done a great job of getting us to speed with the team and we produced more positive in the first quarter than we\u2019ve ever done historically, including the effect of a two-week shutdown for Chinese New Year, the typical ramped up time when everybody returns. So, we were really well positioned on inventory for the quarter. We built inventory a little bit and we worked off all of that backlogs. Bill J. Plovanic \u2013 Canaccord Genuity, Inc.:  Okay. And then there\u2019s been some commentary regarding how strong international was. I mean, by my math you\u2019ve exceeded 10%, which makes it material. What percent of your total revenues is international for you now, 2011, 2012? Brian K. Roberts:  We\u2019re not going to comment specifically on what the revenue number is, but it\u2019s certainly picked up in Q1 a little bit from where we were in Q4 on an absolute dollar basis. Bill J. Plovanic \u2013 Canaccord Genuity, Inc.:  But if it\u2019s over 10%, it becomes material and it will be in the Q, correct? Brian K. Roberts:  That\u2019s a 10-K requirement. So it\u2019s an annual look at what the level of revenue ultimately will be. Bill J. Plovanic \u2013 Canaccord Genuity, Inc.:  Okay. And then my last question is just, when do you expect the LifeScan approval? So you\u2019ve gotten questions back, you\u2019re responding. How many rolls at the FDA do you think this will take before you get that product on the market? Duane DeSisto :  So, Bill, this is Duane. I would tell you that we\u2019ll put the FDA comments into two buckets. The handheld bucket, I would tell you, in terms of our actual handheld. Those comments are pretty straightforward. We\u2019re ready to turn those. There seems to be some new guidance in what\u2019s required for a strip and LifeScan is now starting to wrestle with those. So we\u2019re waiting to hear from them on when they think they can turn the document. I would tell you, as we sit here today, we\u2019re ready on the hand-held side. There was no surprises for us, but there does seem to be a renewed interest at the FDA in terms of \u2013there\u2019s some draft guidance out there that I think that LifeScan is going to be held accountable to. So we\u2019re waiting for them, but its all strip based, I would tell you is the issue. So, I don\u2019t have a good answer for you, but we\u2019ll know a little more here. I think there\u2019s a meeting at the end of this week or the beginning of next week to try to wrestle that to the ground. Bill J. Plovanic \u2013 Canaccord Genuity, Inc.:  Great, thank you. I appreciate you taking the question. Operator :  Our next question comes from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Robbie J. Marcus \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC :  Hi, this is Robbie Marcus in for Mike. Congrats on the good Q. Duane DeSisto : Hey, Robbie, how are you? Robbie J. Marcus \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC :  Good. How are you? Duane DeSisto :  Good. Robbie J. Marcus \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC :  So, as you\u2019re getting approval toward the end of the year and filing for Amgen and Lilly, can you maybe help us frame how we should be thinking about these two opportunities heading into 2015 and beyond and maybe walk us through how they might impact the different lines of the income statement? Brian K. Roberts:  I think overall, Robbie, it\u2019s probably still little premature for us to get too detailed into the thinking around 2015. I mean, at the moment, as we\u2019ve discussed the Lilly 510(k) or the U-500 510(k) is planned for this calendar year. Our expectation certainly remains the same around the Amgen product that towards the end of this calendar we\u2019ll hopefully see an approval there, and Duane just talked a little bit about the PDM. So, within the 2014 framework, certainly I don\u2019t think any of those things will really have a material or pretty much any impact on the 2014 numbers. As we get a little deeper and I think calendar year 2014 we can start to frame out a little bit more what our thinking will be for 2015. Robbie J. Marcus \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC :  Okay. Great. And maybe just a follow-up. Can you provide us maybe where you exited the quarter in terms of how many sales reps you had total and how should we be thinking about rep productivity going through the rest of the year now with the addition of the key account managers? Duane DeSisto : : So that wouldn\u2019t allow us to be in the 130 to 135 range. Again, I think consistent with Duane\u2019s remarks, the goal of these folks are kind of third men in on the team, third men or women in on the team, and so they come with experience and you\u2019ve typically you\u2019re going to kind of focus on a set of practices where we have existing relationships. And so, I certainly think our hope is that, you know, post their initial training that they\u2019ll be able to get u p to speed up fairly quickly. The goal then becomes that the existing territory managers have more bandwidth to be able to get to more on more practices and that\u2019s hopefully something that will allow us to kind of continue to increase this new prescriber base as we get into the back half of this calendar year. Anything to add? Brian K. Roberts:  No, I think \u2013 I guess that we kind of tested this. If you remember our comments last year, we kind of tested it in two accounts. We really think it\u2019s kind of key to where we want to go and the only reason we didn\u2019t do this earlier is we just want to make sure that the production side of the business was stabilized. So we feel good about it. We\u2019ll see here over the next probably this \u2013 a little bit this quarter and then third quarter should be really kind of the thing where we can get a pretty good benchmark and how this is all going to work for us. But we\u2019re pretty excited about what we\u2019ve seen so far. Robbie J. Marcus \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Ben Andrew from William Blair. Please go ahead. Ben C. Andrew \u2013 William Blair & Co. LLC: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. For me, just following on the key account manager\u2019s notion, can you give us some sense, Duane, what kind or what magnitude of productivity gain you achieved in those couple of accounts or maybe in some of the early accounts where you\u2019ve added this because it looks like it\u2019s about a 10% to 15% overlay so far? Brian K. Roberts: Yes. I would tell you in the couple of test accounts we had, we saw 20% to 25% uptick in the business. Ben C. Andrew \u2013 William Blair & Co. LLC: In new patients or total revenues, or is there much difference? Duane DeSisto : In new patients. No, in new patients. Look, the revenue, the great part about our model is if I get you under the curve, it\u2019s like compounded interest. If I get you under the curve, it continues to come every quarter. So, but we\u2019ve seen 20% to 25% increase very, very quickly and in those accounts that more importantly, I think than just the increase in the headcount is I think it\u2019s helping us \u2013 it would be nice to say every products going to be perfect, but when we do have a hiccup those relationships are helping us manage through all of that, all of the stuff that normally goes on in this space. So we just went through this whole recall with the Abbott FreeStyle strip which really had nothing to do with us. But having those people on those accounts help immensely because if you read all the stuff that was out there, it was about as clear as mud from some of the releases that were sent out. Having those people on the ground to help these people was immensely and I think ultimately you build these relationships with these people and they last north, it\u2019s more than just a quarter, it really strengthens the bond between the practitioner and the company. So, we\u2019re pretty excited about what we think it can do for us. Ben C. Andrew \u2013 William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then back on the gross margin discussion, you talked about I think there were three things, but \u2013 one of them you mentioned was the scrap costs that were up. Was that only in manufacturing or did you \u2013 did any of that kind of product that had to be scrapped or led to increased costs make it out into the field? Brian K. Roberts: No, it was only in the manufacturing process Ben C. Andrew \u2013 William Blair & Co. LLC: And what went wrong? Was there some new issue or continuation and you didn\u2019t get the yield improvements you had expected? What exactly happened? Brian K. Roberts: I wouldn\u2019t say anything went wrong to say, I think it\u2019s just kind of normal course of running the lines and ultimately, as you go through the process there are few components where, a product would come in and maybe it was a little bit more on the edge of a tolerance or so, and we saw a higher output of scrap than we were hoping to see and that\u2019s now allowed us to kind of revise the tolerance a little bit with the supplier, but there\u2019s some costs that you have to eat as part of that. I think there\u2019s a piece of it that goes to the fact of we did experience the Chinese New Year effect, if you will, which is a lot of people leave and then you have a new group of folks that come in and have to be trained and while Flextronics did I think a nice job of trying to get ahead of that, there\u2019s always a training component that tends to lead to a little bit more incremental scrap, as well as those lines kind of restart themselves, but I wouldn\u2019t point to anything specific, saying that anything went wrong in the quarter. To achieve, $2.6 million pods that actually adds a lot of rate. Ben C. Andrew \u2013 William Blair & Co. LLC: Sure, sure. And then, Brian, what was the third thing that you mentioned? There was scrap, there was kind of carrying some of the transition of existing patients, and then another gross margin, and I missed that one as you were discussing it. Brian K. Roberts:  Yes, I mean the third one really is on the other side which did this, as we had a little bit higher international revenue plan. That comes with a much lower gross margin profile in the, kind of mid-teen type of percent type of a range which brings down the margin a little. Ben C. Andrew \u2013 William Blair & Co. LLC:  Right. And if you had to put those three things in buckets, were they roughly equal hits to gross margin or disproportionate? Brian K. Roberts:  They are probably roughly equal maybe I think the manufacturing size of scrap plus transition costs would have been little bit more than the international revenue piece, but, you know, they all balance out. Ben C. Andrew \u2013 William Blair & Co. LLC:  Okay. Great. And then last for me is if you\u2019re going to file the 510(k) and you ponder it and Lilly is working through its issues, and I may have missed this answer before and so I apologize, is that like a year-end 2015 launch or can that come earlier? Brian K. Roberts: I think, the real plus for us, I hope this year we get this thing filed in the back half of the year and then we\u2019ll go down the whole regulatory response thing. So we\u2019ll wait and see. I have tried, if you remember the AROs pod was around the corner for two years. So I thought that I will never go down that path again. So we can tell you the piece under our control and then we\u2019ll see what the agency has to say. Ben C. Andrew \u2013 William Blair & Co. LLC:  Fair enough. Thank you much. Operator :  Our next question comes from Thom Gunderson of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Thomas J. Gunderson \u2013 Piper Jaffray & Co:  Duane, when did you say the FDA is going to approve the combo CGM device? Duane DeSisto : Hi, Tom how are you? Thomas J. Gunderson \u2013 Piper Jaffray & Co: I\u2019m good, I\u2019m good. You and Charlie and a whole gang of people did a good job of getting up to a million pods a month, but if growth continues and you\u2019re adding new products, you could need two or three million in the next few years. Is there anything from a capacity standpoint other than adding lines? Do you run out of real estate? Does Flextronics just keep expanding? Any constraints at all or is it just cookie cutter? Duane DeSisto : So I would tell you, for lines four and five, it\u2019s cookie cutter. After that we probably would be \u2013 I think would it be in the best interest of the company long-term would probably within the Flextronics umbrella find a different facility. So it\u2019s not all in one place or we\u2019re spread over \u2013 I think with four and five, we\u2019re spread over a couple of different areas within the same campus, but I think once we get beyond that, I mean, one of the things Pat\u2019s looking at in his team is, okay. Where are other facilities? What\u2019s the cost associated with that? But I do think we moved. The good news is what we\u2019re excited about is three, is the best line that we\u2019ve ever developed, built in terms of productivity, in terms of minimizing the labor associated with it. So we can replicate that. Flex was integral in that and installing that. They\u2019ve seen it from beginning to end. So we\u2019re pretty excited but that\u2019s kind of a fixed cost in the industry and that piece. And like I said, lines four and five are pretty cookie cutter and once we get beyond that, I would tell you I think it\u2019s probably be in our best interest that look for a different facility most likely within the Flex umbrella, but the great part about doing business is, they\u2019re everywhere, from Switzerland to Mexico to Malaysia. I mean, they\u2019re all over the place so. Thomas J. Gunderson \u2013 Piper Jaffray & Co: Got it. And then my last question is since the introduction of the next gen pod, the AROs, I would argue that you have maybe a little bit different new customer. You\u2019ve got new docs that weren\u2019t in before prescribing to new patients that weren\u2019t in before. You\u2019ve got higher growth in international markets. I\u2019m just curious, have you noted any change in the usage up or down from what you had in old gen versus new gen? Duane DeSisto : Yes. That\u2019s an excellent observation because the answer, you\u2019re spot on. And we knew with the old generation products that there were areas, there were bastions of doctors or institutions that given our insulin onboard calculation, given the size of the path, but we knew there were places that we weren\u2019t going to be able to penetrate until we came out of the next generation product. And so as a result of that those were the first guys we immediately went back to with the next generation product. So you remember all the reasons you gave us, you wouldn\u2019t let us in the door. Well, look what we have. So it\u2019s I would tell you the \u2013 from day one, I always thought our product was the perfect product for any kind of active child, define that whatever age you want. My wife would define I\u2019m an active child, so that\u2019s 50 something and below, but I think it\u2019s the perfect product of that and when we shrunk the size and changed the insulin on board calculation, I mean a lot of these guys flung open the door and I am very excited about where the business has come up from. If you kind of think about this long-term, if you\u2019re taking a 13 years to 18 years old and your introduction to insulin pumping, it\u2019s our product you never going on one with a tube? You\u2019re just never going to do and you\u2019ll whatever you can not to go on the shots, so we got the right audience, we got the right people, I think we have a lot of the right doctors. So that\u2019s the mix. And I would tell you we are seeing the same thing internationally, I think people spend enough taking notice. Our last step in terms of the AROs product is we are diligently working on our next-generation handheld which I think is going to be pretty cool and pretty surprising once we get that. And then, I think you\u2019ll have \u2013 there is no such thing as perfect product, you can always make it better, but I think that combination is going to be really, really exciting. It will be fun to everybody in the market. We feel good about where we are and where we\u2019re going. Thomas J. Gunderson \u2013 Piper Jaffray & Co: Got it. Thanks. That\u2019s it for me, guys. Duane DeSisto : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Jayson T. Bedford \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good evening. Just a couple of quick ones here. Just for clarification. The new patient starts, when you referred to 40% growth this quarter, that\u2019s on a sequential basis, not on a year-over-year basis? It may be the same number, but I\u2019m just trying to reconcile your comments. Duane DeSisto :  Yes, comments were Q1 new patients starts were up a little over 20% year-over-year. The comment of north of 40% new patient starts so far here in Q2 is a comparison to Q1 of 2014. Jayson T. Bedford \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Got you. Okay. Has the recall of FreeStyle impacted your business at all? Duane DeSisto :  I think, for probably a period of about three, four weeks we handled lots and lots and lots of questions, but I wouldn\u2019t say \u2013 I\u2019d be pretty disingenuous if I said it impacted the business, but there was no question. We had a three, four-week disruption in which lots of people were calling us. It really didn\u2019t impact getting new customers or really impacted the existing customer base, trying to wrestle to the ground what the right date is, beyond which date are the ones I can use in my meter. And so, it\u2019s like anything else. The last thing in the world you need is people to be distracted by something, but I would tell you that\u2019s pretty much in the rear view mirror now, but it was a three or four-week \u2013 probably a two to three-week period where there was a lot of confusion and then space. Jayson T. Bedford \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then lastly for me, just a follow-up on that. What\u2019s the transition plan to the new LifeScan PDM? Meaning when it\u2019s approved, do you upgrade for free, is this an automatic rollout? What does the rollout look like? Duane DeSisto :  I don\u2019t want to upgrade for free and it was the most painful experience of my life. So we\u2019re never updating anything for free. So you can hear it here, you can write that. As long as I\u2019m here, I\u2019m never doing anything for free, because it hurts too much. I would say I think, once that product is approved then we will just start transitioning new customers and we\u2019ll go from there with it. Brian K. Roberts: I mean we haven\u2019t solidified any commercial plans yet, but\u2026 Duane DeSisto : We solidified one. Brian K. Roberts: Except for the free part. But most likely what we will do is, new customers will ultimately transition directly to the new product, to the LifeScan Verio PDM and these customers, existing customers who wish to get that PDM, I\u2019m sure will have some kind of an upgraded path for those customers, very similar to what we did back probably about five years ago or four years ago when we moved from the PDM 100 to at the time what was the PDM 200. Jayson T. Bedford \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right. Thank you. Duane DeSisto : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Anthony Petrone of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Anthony C. Petrone \u2013 Jefferies LLC :  Thanks. Just a couple of questions here maybe for Brian and/or Duane. Can we just go back to maybe existing penetration in type 1, just overall where you kind of see that today? All I know is we have 25%. And then, as you look forward and you look at the continued migration with MDI patients, but now you have the key account manager overlay. Does that migration sort of accelerate and where do you think it can go over time? Brian K. Roberts:  This is Brian. At a high level, I mean again and I think everybody has numbers that are approximates of this. We\u2019ve always kind of used \u2013 there\u2019s about 1.7 million or so people in the United States living with type 1 diabetes today and pump penetration is probably somewhere around 25% of that number, maybe a little more, which would get to imply somewhere around 400,000 to 450,000 people on insulin pumps. So we\u2019re in the country right now. There is certainly \u2013 when I started with Insulet, now five years ago. That pump penetration those numbers are probably more like 1.5 million people and it was about 22% penetration. So certainly the numbers have gone up over that period of time and I think, to Insulet\u2019s credit, a lot of that has been on the back of this company. As you have seen, others out there in the market who have, you know, kind of talked about their numbers or so will be relatively modest increases or relatively flat over time. Obviously, our growth has been primarily from the multiple daily injection patient and we\u2019ve basically gone more than zero to north of 60,000 in that period. So I think a lot of it has been here. Certainly as we continue to add more prescribers and it\u2019s probably packed up in your new resources to commercial being some quarter and it gives us more reach and frequency to be able to get to these doctors which we know is a tried and true piece of how you are from the go-to business. Certainly there is an awful lot of people out there still for Insulet Company we believe makes an awful lot of sense. So I think our view is that Insulet can certainly continue to be the driver of you accelerating this overall market penetration by bringing more and more MDI people to pumping in general. Anthony C. Petrone \u2013 Jefferies LLC : That\u2019s helpful. Maybe a couple of follow-ups on gross margin. Maybe not specifically for 2015, but as we look ahead to CGM enabled pod and then maybe even the pod for drug delivery, can you maybe give a high-level overview of where you see the gross margin for those two specific products settling over time? Duane DeSisto : Again little earlier on CGM-enabled pod to probably talked about I mean, certainly what\u2019s intriguing about the space is because \u2013 and I think what makes us very unique in it is because we have so much of a commonality of components, if you will, between what makes up a CGM center and what makes up our pod. There is an awful lot of leverage to be gained by effectively integrating that center directly into the product, insertion, battery power, the ASIC all of these different pieces. I think it\u2019s unique to us in trying to be able to put these two devices together which allows us a kind of gross margin leverage play. If you look at reimbursement of the two products individually today, the average probably is somewhere in the neighborhood of $9 to $10 per day of revenue. If you look that over a three day period you are talking about somewhere between $54 to $60 of revenue. And we\u2019ve commented it historically that you think we could add the center into the pods for \u2013 call it somewhere probably in the dollar range or so, which would allow us to be a mid-teen price pod by that point with a higher revenue potential. Specifically, around the other drug delivery product, we talked about one of the benefits \u2013 in general of that space, is that we think we can leverage and awful lot of what we do on diabetes products and therefore again be able to keep the cost basically the same with where we are \u2013 little bit of increase but not a lot and be able to charge a higher revenue number for that hopefully on average somewhere in the 2X plus kind of a range. So the other big benefit there is no a lot of operating expenses. So the majority of that margin should ultimately fall to the bottom line. Anthony C. Petrone \u2013 Jefferies LLC : Helpful. And the last one for me is just a little bit more detail on Amgen and the supply agreement there. Is Insulet exclusive in those specific drug categories that you mentioned, so for instance in oncology, or can you sign with another pharmaceutical partner, whether it\u2019s in oncology or another drug category? Thanks again. Duane DeSisto : Yes, can\u2019t see the pretty wide categories so there is exclusivity but it\u2019s pretty narrowing upon. So we see a plenty of opportunities there. Anthony C. Petrone \u2013 Jefferies LLC : Great. Operator : Our next question comes from Mimi Pham from ABR Healthco. Please go ahead. Mimi Pham \u2013 ABR Healthco : Hi, good afternoon. Can you just clarify your comments about the 70% of additional orders coming back from your new doctors? Does that mean regarding new prescribers in last year like through 2013, 70% of them have put in a new prescription during the first quarter? Brian K. Roberts: Not necessarily all in the first quarter, but, I mean, certainly since these new doctors have come on. So, it includes new doctors who started a new patient in the first quarter. So we\u2019re kind of penalizing ourselves a little bit there in the sense of those doctors won\u2019t necessarily add their second patient in the same first period, but 35% plus of our prescribing base that are new doctors, over 70% of them so far have now placed additional orders since their initial. Mimi Pham \u2013 ABR Healthco : Okay. And so then the 30% that haven\u2019t come back yet, I guess some of it will be taking more time since some of them are from the first quarter. Do you think any \u2013 have you lost any new prescribers for any reason? Brian K. Roberts:  I can\u2019t tell you definitively that every single doctor will prescribe again, but some of whole I think again the feedback across the country, across the commercial teams, across the prescriber base has been extremely positive. So we think the trends are in the right direction. Mimi Pham \u2013 ABR Healthco : And then in terms of the Type 2 Lilly pump, if it\u2019s approved by mid next year, will reimbursement be all in place or is there anything that has to be \u2013 would there be some delay or anything that has to be done on your or Lilly\u2019s side? Duane DeSisto : Far be it for me to speak \u2013 this is Duane, far be it for me speak from the Lily perspective, I think today U-500 is approved today, the OmniPod is approved, and if a doctor writes for Type 2, the hurdle rate in terms of requirements that a carrier may want to see is greater, but they do reimburse for it. So, I don\u2019t think there is, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to need any code. I don\u2019t think so because, like I said, we know for a fact that both products are approved and from a carrier\u2019s standpoint if there\u2019s a need they will approve Brian K. Roberts: Yes and keep in mind that today somewhere between and again it\u2019s modest, but 3% to 5% of our overall patient population are Type 2s. So, Type 2s can get approve on insulin pumping whatever drug they\u2019re using inform of insulin we don\u2019t have visibility too. But we just follow the same process that we do with Type 1s. And typically, what you see is there is some additional paper work requirements that we have to go through, but on the whole people are getting approved. Mimi Pham \u2013 ABR Healthco : Okay. And then on the competitive front, Tandem mentioned last night that now half of their patients or new patient adds were all new to pumping. Are you seeing them more in \u2013 at centers, patients choosing their (inaudible) over the OmniPod in terms of the new to pumping patients or do you get a sense that they\u2019re taking these new patients from potential Medtronic or J&J. Duane DeSisto : Okay, I guess this is Duane. I would say, I think there is for us, there is one major competitor in space. And we all know who that is and the competition occurs in mine shares at doctor\u2019s office. At a customer level, I\u2019ll use the old analogy, we\u2019re selling a motorcycle, everyone else is selling a car, if you like a motorcycle, we get the business. If you want a car, there\u2019s two or three guys selling the car. So like I said, our focus is on the big guy. Mimi Pham \u2013 ABR Healthco : Got it. Thank you very much. Duane DeSisto : Thank you. Operator : And there are no further questions. I\u2019d like to turn it back over to Duane DeSisto for closing remarks. Duane DeSisto : Thank you everyone for joining us on first quarter call and we look forward to updating you in Q2. Have a good night. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your attendance you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

DeSisto: Thanks, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our second quarter results highlighted by record levels of revenue and gross margin, demonstrates the strong progress we continue to make across all aspects of the business. For the second quarter, we reported consolidated revenue of $72 million representing 20% growth over the same period last year. Demand for the new OmniPod remains high as evidenced by 35% OmniPod revenue growth year-over-year as our easily used water proof tubeless design continues to appeal to customers especially in key demographics such as children. Over 35% of our new patient starts this year are children under the age of 18 with nearly 40% of them aged 10 and under. Just as an point, the OmniPod continues to make positive strides with healthcare professionals. Since launch in February 2013, nearly 40% of prescribing physicians are new to the OmniPod with over 75% now EP prescribers. In addition to this sweet side to the Pod, HCP has continued to cite the updated insulin on-board calculator. The simplicity of the system is ready-to-wear without assembly and lifestyle connivance is key reasons why they prescribe the product. And they say, that these features are especially \u2013 prescribing the OmniPod to people who have not previously used an insulin pump. Approximately 70% of our patience starts continued to be people who are new to insulin pumping. When these people are asked why they choose the OmniPod, the answer is simple, better glucose control without sacrificing freedom, ensuring the way we can meet the service needs of both our customers and our prescribing healthcare professionals is critical to our long-term growth. As soon as completing the process to transition our patient base in the new OmniPod last fall, we have worked tirelessly to rebuild confidence in our customer service functions, they came under pressure from the demand at the launch. I\u2019m incredibly pleased to note that we have returned our satisfaction levels to those who see increased transition. Today, over 95% of our patients will refer the OmniPod to a friend and 9 out of 10 patients consider themselves satisfied, very satisfied with the OmniPod as a whole. To ensure we are meeting the increased demands for larger prescriber base, we embarked earlier this year to expand the commercial field sales team from approximately 110 to 130 people; to do this, we established a new role, the Key Account Manager, who would join existing territories and be tasked with ensuring the high level customer service to critical existing accounts. Our initial new resources were hired by April, trained in the field by early May, the remaining product class has been in the field since June 1. With these new reps in place, we\u2019re about half of the second quarter, we\u2019re very pleased with their early success. Territories with the Key Account Manager have generated a 10% increase from referrals as compared to a standard territory. We\u2019re seeing even better results in the beginning of the third quarter with referrals outpacing our second quarter results. With referrals increasing and productivity improving, we enter third quarter with our largest customer pipelines since the launch of the new OmniPod. That said, new patient starts which have increased by approximately 20% year-over-year were impacted in the second quarter by a unilateral change made by a significant managed care plans as their reimbursement polices. So I think, unexpected reimbursement cost due to code usage by Type 2 products and lower priced cost alternatives the managed care provider stop the only patient shipments and existing customer reorders to reestablish medical necessity for patients. This managed care plan typically accounts for approximately 15% of our new patient starts in the given period and to service through a distributor partner as we do not hold this direct contact with the provider. Once we become aware the problem our commercial team assisted our distribution partner in resolving the issue for existing patient reorders. We continue to work with our distributor and the managed care provider on finding the appropriate solution for new patients. We are currently backlog in new patient starts until the issue resolved. I am confident that we will resolve this issue in the next few months. We impacted the business from this issue was approximately $1.5 million revenue in the second quarter and will likely continue to affect the third quarter as well. In total we anticipate this issue to result and up to a $10 million reduction in 2014 revenue. Our international business with Ypsomed and GlaxoSmithKline have another strong quarter and remains on pace the double revenue year-over-year. Ypsomed continues to takes you in key markets such as Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland, and just recently officially launched in Italy as well. Turning to our manufacturing operations, from the third straight quarter we manufactured approximately 2.5 million OmniPods providing the level of stability and predictability, we haven\u2019t had in our history. At a consistent level of 40,000 OmniPods per day, we have been able to improve quality, reduce scrap costs, resulting in an expanding gross margins. I am very pleased that we achieved two significant milestones in second quarter, as our U.S. OmniPod margins increased to over 60%, and our consolidated gross margin reached 50%. While on a consolidated basis gross margin is continue to be impacted, slightly by pricing the product mix within our neighborhood subsidiary. We are confident that we will see continued gross margin expansion of approximately 200 to 300 basis points per quarter for the remainder of 2014. Although proud of our progress with the new OmniPod, I am very excited about the many products that we have in the \u2013 our pipeline. We expect that these products will keep insulin at the forefront of innovation for years to come. Let me provide you with some updates starting with the exciting news we announced earlier this week. We are very pleased that we have been able to rekindle our development partnership with DexCom. Over the last couple of months we have announced two collaborations which we believe will provide a combined patients with easier access to the data they need to more efficiently manage the diabetes. The first announcement in June at the American Diabetes Association conference in San Francisco is the integration of certain OmniPod data into DexCom\u2019s first of its kind mobile application. The second collaboration announced on Tuesday at the American Association of Diabetes Educators conference in Orlando is the integration of DexCom glucose data into a new Bluetooth enabled PDM, which is currently under development. Our goal with this project is to be able to develop software to similar to what DexCom has under development which we\u2019ll be able to be displayed on our PDM. For both projects, we will each be responsible for our own development cost with much of DexCom\u2019s investment focused on their new mobile application and most of our investment focused on the integration from new PDM. We feel strongly the time is right for these collaborations to move forward. While we are very excited to be partnering with DexCom again do continue forward with our own CGM enabled OmniPod project with a separate partner as well. As I mentioned last quarter, we have made significant progress over the past couple of quarters with the completion of an insertion study as well as resolving our sterilization challenges. Over the back half of the year, we will be working on prototype development and additional testing to compare for human trials in early 2015. We also continue to partner with LifeScan on the integration of the variable plug glucose meter platform into the PDM. In May, we received initial questions back from the FDA, but most of the questions are on additional testing to be completed. At this point, the extra testing has been finished, the report has been compiled. We anticipate responding back to the FDA by quarter end with hope for an approval in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re also making great progress on our U-500 product and planning to ship with Eli Lilly, and complete their first round of human practice testing this past quarter, and expect to start a second round in the coming weeks. We still anticipate to file the 10-K submission of our product to the FDA by the end of the year. The number of people living with Type 2 diabetes in the U.S. is staggering and these increases each and every day. New cost effective treatments need to be introduced to help combat this growing epidemic. We continue to receive positive feedback from many healthcare professional by this collaborative offering. The OmniPod has the potential to be an effective easy to use alternative from improved compliance, improved A1C benefits for these highly insulin resistant patients. We also remain enthusiastic about several opportunities in non-insulin drug delivery space. We believe the opportunity in the drug delivery space is important. Our Amgen partnership has a chance to be game changer when we look forward to the approval of the product by the FDA. With both Ferring and Amgen products in the commercial phase, we\u2019ve proven that our OmniPod is the solution for subcutaneous drug delivery. Outside of these relationships, we have a number of other initiatives in the development phase. We look forward to discussing additional opportunities in the future. Finally, let me mention a couple of additional items to note in the quarter. First, we entered into a settlement and license agreement with Becton Dickinson and company to resolve the outstanding patent litigation. Given the uncertainty distraction and continued expense that come with the jury trial, we determined that this was an appropriate time to reach a settlement. As such in June, we agreed to a $5 million one-time payment has taken its charge of approximately $7 million in the P&L to account from the settlement and the associated legal fees incurred. We also took advantage of the financial markets in the second quarter and refinanced our convertible debt. Through this refinancing which Brian will discuss some more detail. We are able to extent the maturity by 3 years to June of 2019. Reduce our cashes risk rate nearly in half to 2% and increased the conversion price by over 75%, $46.51 million per share. And with that, I will turn the call over to Brian. Brian K. Roberts: Thank you, Duane. Consolidated revenue increased by 20% year-over-year to $72 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2014 form $60.1 million in the same period last year. OmniPod revenue grew by more than 35% in the second quarter of last year. Consolidated revenue for the first six months of this year was $141.2 million compared to $117.4 million from the first six months of 2013, an increase of approximately 20% year-over-year. Gross profit increased by 33% in the second quarter to $35.8 million as compared to gross profit of $26.8 million in the second quarter of 2013. As Duane noted, we achieved record gross margins in the second quarter as our U.S. OmniPod gross margin eclipsed 60% for our consolidated gross margin of 50% represents a 500 basis point increase over the second quarter of 2013. Since the transition for the new OmniPod commenced in the first quarter of last year, we\u2019ve gained nearly 700 basis points in gross margin. The increase in margin is a direct result of continued reductions in the overall cost to produce each OmniPod based on the lower bill of materials, higher manufacturing volumes, and reduced scrap charges. We continue to expect to add approximately 200 basis points to 300 basis points of gross margin in each of the third and fourth quarters of this year as we take further advantage of the efficiencies gained from the new OmniPod. Gross profit for the first six months of 2014 was $68.6 million, an increase of $16.6 million or 32% as compared to $52 million in the first six months of 2013. Operating expenses increased by $8.4 million or 26% year-over-year to $41 million in the second quarter from $32.7 million in the prior year. This increase is primarily a result of approximately $7 million in settlement and legal costs related to the patent litigation with Becton, Dickinson and Company. Sequentially, operating expenses increased by $6.4 million from the first quarter of 2014 again due to the lawsuit settlement. We expect the operating expenses in the range of $36 million to $38 million per quarter for Q3 and Q4 reflecting the investments into the sales and marketing functions. Operating expense were $75.7 million for the first six months compared to $64 million for the first six months of 2013. Operating loss was $5.3 million compared to $5.8 million in the prior year. Excluding the one-time settlement charges, we would have generated an operating profit of approximately $1.7 million in the second quarter, an improvement of approximately $7.5 million over the second quarter of last year. We expect to be operating profitable going forward. Interest and other expense was $23.8 million in the second quarter compared to $4.6 million last year. In June, we issued approximately $201 million of 2% convertible senior notes maturing in June 2019, and used $160 million of the net proceeds to repurchase the $115 million of the outstanding 3.75% notes due June 2016. In connection with the repurchase, we recorded a one-time loss from the extinguishment of debt of $18.9 million. We also called the remaining $28.8 million of outstanding 3.75% notes for redemption in June. These notes were extinguished just last week in exchange for $28.8 million in cash and approximately 350,000 shares of common stock. Net interest and other expense was $28 million for the first six months compared to $8.9 million for the first six months of last year. Going forward, we expect to record total interest expense each quarter of $3 million comprised of $1 million in cash interest expense and $2 million in non-cash interest expense. Our net loss for the second quarter of 2014 was $29.1 million or $0.53 per share as compared to a net loss of $10.5 million or $0.20 per share for the second quarter of last year. Excluding the impact of the patent settlement and the extinguishment of the 3.75% convertible notes, our net loss would have been approximately $3.2 million or approximately $0.06 per share, representing a 70% improvement over the second quarter of 2013. Net loss for the first six months was $35.3 million or $0.64 per share compared to $21.2 million or $0.40 per share for the first six months of last year. Our cash and cash equivalents balance was $175.5 million at June 30 compared to $149.7 million at December 31. As of June 30, we had approximately 55.5 million common shares outstanding. Finally, as Duane noted, we remain confident in the business and are pleased with our first half results. Gross margin continue to expand and our manufacturing operations continue to excel. The investments in the commercial team should produce a return in the second half of the year and our international business remains on pace to double in 2014. With the patent lawsuit settled and the convertible debt refinancing complete, we are poised to show operating profit going forward. That said, taking into consideration, the payor issue, which impacted the second quarter and our expectation that it will likely continue to affect the back half of the year, we have adjusted our 2014 revenue expectations to $290 million to $300 million. This change represents a 3% reduction in revenue at the midpoint. For the third quarter, we expect revenue of $73 million to $77 million. And with that, let me turn the call back over to Duane. Duane M. DeSisto: Thanks, Brian. In summary, we\u2019re pleased with our second quarter results. Despite recent payor challenge, which I\u2019m confident we will resolve, we demonstrated outstanding revenue growth of 35% in the OmniPod business and 20% overall. We are well positioned for continued robust growth as the addition of 20 new commercial team members make a positive impact throughout the back half of the year. Our pipeline is strong our gross continuing increase month-over-month, and the team is excited and engaged. Our manufacturing operations continue to show the levels of stability and consistency never before by Insulet and we remain on track to passing the form of fourth manufacturing line in the next few months. We continue to be an innovative leader in this space with several exciting initiatives in \u2013 and I\u2019m pleased to see new opportunities going forward. I\u2019m confident and excited about the strong second half of 2014. With that operator, please open the phones for questions. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Danielle Antalffy with Leerink Partners. Your line is open. Danielle J. Antalffy \u2013 Leerink Partners LLC.:  Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Duane M. DeSisto:  Hi, Danielle. Danielle J. Antalffy \u2013 Leerink Partners LLC.:  Just was a follow-up on the payor issue, number one what gives you guys confidence that you will resolve this issue and then a follow-up to that, what the risk of the business. There is other payors follow suite or do you think that we have possibility? Duane M. DeSisto:  It\u2019s a great question, Daniel. So a) we are confident because as soon as \u2013 the thing that makes us a little different \u2013 just certainly when I'm called clear is all these projects, all these payor contracts come up for renewal. So, this is an ongoing issue we\u2019ll make this a little different. It was and we are in the middle of negotiating with the distributor and the payor, all three of us together here. So I don\u2019t want to go too far obviously because we\u2019re working our way through it. But this was a little bit of a knee-jerk reaction what the payors are going through some of the various codes in categories and so they just shut them all down which that the equipment people at risk, it\u2019s the big deal. So as soon as we are made aware of it, we got involved, we got the reorder business turn back on. The payor has already offered up a potential solution in terms of how to handle this on a go forward basis. We are not exactly thrilled with it \u2013 once again I don\u2019t want to throw the details on what the solution is. Sufficed to say it makes the process more complicated, it\u2019s not a price of action at the moment, it\u2019s none of that, just makes the price more complicated. But it does appear that things were going through the category most notably the stuff that will kind of affect the type 2 patients that they were not happy about. And so as we saw they dug in their first solutions at the door. So, having said that, could it happen again? Yeah. This is a little bit of a really harsh reaction. Obviously there is \u2013 there is not a year that it goes by, we are not \u2013 so this was a little bit unusual, took us by surprise because we really want to first contacted. We kind of noticed distributors business being an impact that we start to point them on to it. They started thinking as, so it took us a little while to get to the bottom of what was happening. But our customers gave us the heads up when we started driving that process. So, a little bit up in the one, and I will gets that \u2013 what is clear is insulin pumping that affair kind of anything else that\u2019s out there for Type 1 diabetes patients, and this continues to be more studies proving that. So, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be a long-term issue, but suffice to say, this is what it is, we don\u2019t have a resolve today, that\u2019s why we are temporally, we have guidance on the back half until we get it resolved. Hopefully, we will get on the call the next quarter, if we got it all resolve, we can give you a little clearer view of it. But, it is resolvable, it\u2019s just legacy that were in the middle of it side, I don\u2019t want to get too far in detail with as the terms of what\u2019s going on. Danielle J. Antalffy \u2013 Leerink Partners LLC.:  Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just wanted to get your thoughts on that, the partnership with Dexcom, happy to see that \u2013 how are you trying to think about that from a growth perspective, is that a big driver for new patient adds or is that just sort of incremental. So how big of a deal should we be thinking about that from a top line growth perspective? Duane M. DeSisto:  Okay, I think \u2013 I didn\u2019t have the opportunity to listen in on Dexcom\u2019s call yesterday, but I think it\u2019s \u2013 I think it\u2019s going to help, it will continue to help both companies. In the long term, I think the real thing is, when we start trying to figure out how it\u2019s going to be dialed in, really it comes around the timing here, and we\u2019re working out those details. It\u2019s with Dexcom\u2019s Gen5 sensors, so that really is kind of the drivers in terms of when it\u2019s going to impact the business. Danielle J. Antalffy \u2013 Leerink Partners LLC.:  All right. Thanks so much guys. Duane M. DeSisto:  Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from William Plovanic of Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. William J. Plovanic \u2013 Canaccord Genuity, Inc: Great. Thank you. Good evening, can you hear me? Duane M. DeSisto:  Hey, Bill. Brian K. Roberts: Hey, Bill. William J. Plovanic \u2013 Canaccord Genuity, Inc:  So just clarity, so the re-order has been cleared up, so the utilization re-order rate should not be impacted going forward, correct? Duane M. DeSisto:  That\u2019s correct. William J. Plovanic \u2013 Canaccord Genuity, Inc:  And then so it\u2019s only on the new patients. And then would that also affect your NDI business? Duane M. DeSisto:  What do you mean? Our NDI segment, the neighborhood business? William J. Plovanic \u2013 Canaccord Genuity, Inc:  Yes. Duane M. DeSisto:  These aren\u2019t patients that go through the neighborhood with those separate managed care. The managed care payor that goes through our third party distributor but it\u2019s not neighborhood. William J. Plovanic \u2013 Canaccord Genuity, Inc:  Okay, okay. And then just \u2013 if I look at inventories in the quarter, they\u2019re extremely low or very low. Are there any manufacturing issues or concerns or \u2013 I mean it tells us demand is high, but your inventory is burned down a little, I\u2019m just curious on your thoughts on that. Duane M. DeSisto:  I think, Bill, it\u2019s a great question, I think from our standpoint what you don\u2019t see there is all the stuff that\u2019s in China moving forward, but having said that, the inventory levels where want to no, I think Q3, you\u2019ll see an incremental up tick in the inventory number, and hopefully by Q4, we\u2019ll be kind of closer to where we want to be. William J. Plovanic \u2013 Canaccord Genuity, Inc:  Okay. And then, you have a \u2013 was it a fourth line, it\u2019s up incoming, is that still on track or where are you with it? Duane M. DeSisto:  Yes, fourth line is on track, and it should be producing product for us before year end. William J. Plovanic \u2013 Canaccord Genuity, Inc:  Okay, so that\u2019s what will help your resolve it in the fourth quarter. Duane M. DeSisto:  Yeah, I mean we continue to make really good progress, I mean obviously, just the level of consistency that we\u2019ve had in production going back the last nine months now has been, I think unique to our business over the last six years at least where that\u2019s been around which is great. The operations team is doing a fantastic job, I think we\u2019ve seen a little bit of an uptick here in the third quarter in production from them and we should be hopefully near two and three quarters the 3 million pause in the third quarter of this year and then you are growing even beyond that hopefully in Q4 with the addition of line for then producing as well. So, but production is going very well. William J. Plovanic \u2013 Canaccord Genuity, Inc:  Okay. And then last question if I may, just if you strip out the 2 million, the 7 million in charges your G&A would have been a level we haven\u2019t seem since 2012 on an absolute nominal basis, is that the right number to go off of I mean you are spending that much on litigation so that\u2019s kind of our new core base rate or how do we think about that. And that\u2019s all I have. Thank you. Duane M. DeSisto:  Yeah, sure Bill, I think that\u2019s right. I mean again in total we are talking about $36 million to $38 million of operating expenses per quarter for Q3 and Q4, Q3 is really the first full quarter where we have incurred all of the charges related to the sales and marketing hires that we did, but on the G&A line yeah, I think that\u2019s accurate, we certainly have worked our way over the course of the last 12 months through the Medtronic litigation last fall, but that in the litigation the couple of these other item and that\u2019s hopefully all behind us at this point. William J. Plovanic \u2013 Canaccord Genuity, Inc:  Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Raj Denhoy of Jefferies. Your line is open. Raj Denhoy \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.:  Wonder if I could ask one about the managed care situation as well, I think Daniel asked this, why don\u2019t you answer it, but just in terms of the what gives you the confidence that you wanted this in other payors as well? Duane M. DeSisto: Raj, I guess where we are at, we didn\u2019t add this with our products in the market since 2005. This the first time we\u2019ve seen anything like that and part of this I think will makes it a little unusual, is we go through about three distributors in the U.S. that has this one big healthcare contract. And so this is one of the few that we don\u2019t have the seat on the table \u2013 seat at the table and like I said so I think will makes this a little unusual, we were hearing from our customers, we had again engage with the distributor, distributor again engage with the managed care. So, I think, all the other stock, I mean we have good relationships with these manage care providers. If there\u2019s changes in coverage or anything going on, we are usually involved in the discussion. So I think that\u2019s makes this a little bit of a kind of one off. It\u2019s a major provider so it made it problematic, but like I said, I think everywhere else we don\u2019t think the relationship could extend. People are thinking about changes in policy, these ongoing discussions, you can kind of anticipate it, you can understand where they\u2019re coming from and there is give and take. This was \u2013 by the time we\u2019re going to engage this, it\u2019s just going to shut down the whole kind of insulin pump category, general and that was their solution, and this time they\u2019re turning back on. So a little different, I\u2019m not saying, it would have been different if we had a direct contact, we had a direct contract with this customer, but I would tell you, this is way out of the norm for what we typically say. Brian K. Roberts: Yeah, Raj, this is Brian. I just had a couple of things, one is, it\u2019s been well known really over the last year or so, since Medtronic launched 530G, that there were plant that we\u2019re \u2013 you\u2019re not wanting to reimburse for that product and we\u2019re holding it back, and your debt has been well documented. Our understanding is that, this provider, it impacted not just Insulet, it impacted others as well. I think that would be one of the ones that was impacted was the 530G. So it\u2019s not unique, but as Duane pointed out, it is a little unique \u2013 in this one as we don\u2019t hold the direct relationship, and so, it just took us a little bit longer, I think to be able to get involved in it. Hopefully, at the end of just some noise \u2013 and we\u2019ll work our way through it over the next couple of months, and we\u2019ll just be done with it. Raj Denhoy \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.:  Okay, just one more question on that as well, I think you described it as being related to Type 2 diabetics perhaps being reimbursed, I think, and I don\u2019t even get a lot of detail with what I understood with that perhaps Type 2 diabetics for getting reimbursed for these pumps, is that correct, and that\u2019s what figures this? Duane M. DeSisto:  So one of the \u2013 Brian described kind of little bit on the higher end, higher-priced pumps, one of the other things that we\u2019re looking at is, why we\u2019re Type 2 patients. The insulin dependent Type 2 patients being reimbursed for our pump, so that once again, keep in mind Russ, I think you got pretty respective, we\u2019re kind of the third man in on this, so this is \u2013 and obviously, we\u2019ll step in the driver\u2019s seat if it doesn\u2019t get resolved the right way. But we heard that, that was another piece of what they reacted to they couldn\u2019t understand why Type 2 patients. Given that there are other low cost solutions for insulin dependent Type 2s, they were not happy with the fact that some Type 2 patients will be reimbursed. Duane M. DeSisto:  To be clear, they are not our patients. Raj Denhoy \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.:  Yeah. Duane M. DeSisto:  These weren\u2019t our charges going through. These were other companies using codes mainly for getting Type 2 reimbursement, that the plans I guess were surprised by. Raj Denhoy \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.:  Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And may be just I\u2019ll ask one about the drug delivery business that you commented on, it\u2019s still waiting for the FDA approval on the Amgen pump. But do you have any updates on that in terms of when we might expect that product and I think a level of enthusiasm might have ticked up a little bit too. But maybe you could update us on your expectations where we can expect like its approved. Duane M. DeSisto:  Yeah, I mean for us it\u2019s unchanged and we\u2019ve been in constant dialog with the Amgen folks I think they are working through their process, I don\u2019t want to talk on their behalf, but overall I think we are all feeling pretty confident that the timelines we\u2019ve laid out are still holding true. So, I think overall everything were seem to be hearing as positive and we are moving forward as planned. Raj Denhoy \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.:  Okay. Helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Gunderson of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Tom Gunderson \u2013 Piper Jaffray & Co.:  Hi guys. Let\u2019s talk about the payor problem. The so far what I understood\u2026 Duane M. DeSisto:  You don\u2019t want to talk about the 35% growth or the 20% year-over-year. Tom Gunderson \u2013 Piper Jaffray & Co.:  Well and it really gets down to that because if this is just a speed bump for a company that\u2019s growing its main product by 35% than \u2013 we are just going to work on through it but what we need to do is just understand all the details of it to see, that this really is a speed bump. So from next level of detail that I am looking at based on what you are saying to Raj, earlier is it affects all pumps, you have the distributor\u2019s contract as far as OmniPod goes right. Is that what I am hearing? Duane M. DeSisto:  It\u2019s a distributed contract. I am not sure it affects all pumps. I want to be cautious about that. It doesn\u2019t take other pumps. Tom Gunderson \u2013 Piper Jaffray & Co.:  But to correct this, do you need to correct it for all the pumps that are involved by this? Or can you focus and get this taken care just for you so that you\u2019re dealing in the things that you can control? Duane M. DeSisto: Yeah. I know we are dealing in the parts that we can control. The benefits we have is obviously we have a separate coding structure, then the all the other guys, primarily all the other guys. Right, although there is thus seen to little bit due to activity on our course by others, which probably caused a little bit of their inks and was unexpected. So we can work through our codes in our parts and ultimately you\u2019ll figure out, frankly how do we just get them a little bit more comfortable that the patients that are being pushed through our distributor partner are the right patients to be going on the problem. As Duane pointed out, I think one of the questions they are holding is really just around medical necessity, and I think within the Type 1 community, medical necessity is pretty well documented. So, we just have to make sure we\u2019re clear with people, and clear with the specific provider, I think of who these folks are, why they need the product, and what do they need to be able to make those approvals in a more timely manner? Brian K. Roberts:  And that\u2019s the part that\u2019s a little bit of a head scratcher, is DCCT has been around for over 20 years, and there is medical necessity that\u2019s virtually irrefutable for Type 1s and I am just wondering that are you running across, did you get kind of thrown out with the bath water kind of thing here? Or is there somebody who\u2019s got their number next up? Or \u2013 trying to get \u2013 what it takes to correct? Duane M. DeSisto:  So I think Brian adequately described kind of what it takes to correct. I think the situation as you described it. There is some higher price products coming into the market that seems to be slippening to various codes. Tom Gunderson \u2013 Piper Jaffray & Co.:  Got it. Duane M. DeSisto:  There seems to be some kind of lower end Type 2 products that it \u2013 once again we are not at the table at the moment, but from where we're be in total, there\u2019s some lower end Type 2 products that try to kind of slipping under some of our codes. So the Type 2 in the higher end products both I think sent this provider, the sale case of solution is we shut the door and then we\u2019ll get everybody to come to us as opposed to asking the question. It\u2019s kind of seems to be the efforts they took; one would be my preferential approach, but it does seems to be the \u2013 so like I said, getting the reimbursement, it caused us a few weeks here in the quarter for getting the \u2013 getting the reorder stuff turned back on, which is pretty straight forward process, and we think once some of the stuff gets cleared up here, we\u2019d be able to get this turned back on. Like I said, the only thing that was kind of really unusual for us is, because we did not see it on the table, we started getting customer calls, which led us to call our distributor partner, which led down to call the managed care provider, and which is based on the way I described the batched took up. That\u2019s a good time in the quarter, and we\u2019re working as fast as we can to straighten this other thing up. Tom Gunderson \u2013 Piper Jaffray & Co.:  Okay. I got it. Thanks for the extra details. Good job on the 35%. Duane M. DeSisto:  Thank you. Brian K. Roberts: Thank you, Tom. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Andrew of William Blair. Your line is open. Benjamin Andrew \u2013 William Blair & Company: Okay, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I think you\u2019ve said there is about $10 million of impact on the full year, is that roughly split Q3, Q4 residual after the 1.5. Duane M. DeSisto:  Yeah, I think I think it\u2019s kind of pretty much all exclusive Ben and I think what we said is, it could be up to a million. We are hoping today the guidance we\u2019re giving obviously reflects that relatively get this cleaned up year end and hopefully next quarter we can come back in tweet it one more time. Brian K. Roberts: Yeah, I mean to add to that, I mean basically obviously these new patient starts you delay new patient starts, delay the timing of when the re-orders commit. So impacting Q2 about patient starts delay the timing when the re-orders comes through in that\u2019s the impact to compound little bit so, impact Q2 is about $1.5 million, impacting Q3 is probably above $3 million if you look at it, and then Q4 could represent the other, the other five or so kind of the worst case scenario if we really wanted \u2013 up to the whole $10 million. So, hopefully we\u2019re able to do solve it in time to \u2013 the first sem of that Q4 hit obviously new patients that don\u2019t start later we can\u2019t get that timing back, but we can effect it to the others going forward. Benjamin Andrew \u2013 William Blair & Company:  Sure, and I guess \u2013 maybe hard to know, but if you loose some of these new patients starts, you\u2019re losing for good to maybe one of those other pumps that weren\u2019t impacted or can you tell? Duane M. DeSisto:  I think it\u2019s \u2013 at the moment, I think it\u2019s tough to tell, we know who these patients are now, so we\u2019ve opened up a dialog with them. We\u2019ll keep them in the loop and we\u2019re trying to keep them as warm as you can keep them, right? And I think if it goes on a couple of more weeks, I think we feel good, if it goes on eight more weeks, obviously, some people may lose a little bit more interest. I think the one thing, I think the one thing that we have going for us is, it\u2019s a pretty that people have chosen this product, they chose it for the obvious reasons, and so the goal is something out may not be, what we do worry about is they say, what let me just keep taking my shots, and may be I will go back and make this, we did this at end of the year rightly four months without \u2013 right before I might did that was reset. So, that\u2019s the kind of thing we are concerned about, they \u2013 they can\u2019t just say, don\u2019t needed now, I look at it, I look at it late in the year right before my insurance plan reset and I will be able to defend. So, I am not sure we loosing to another pump, but we may just lose some back that comes. Benjamin Andrew \u2013 William Blair & Company:  Okay. And can you give us a little more granularity on when in the quarter you became aware of this and when you kind of started to be able \u2013 try to be alert? Duane M. DeSisto:  You know, I mean, what\u2019s seems to be clear to begin part of the way we figure this out as you seeing ordering pattern from a distributor so. It looks like it happens really in the beginning part of May, but I would say we really didn\u2019t become aware of it until the earlier part of June, right. So kind of really second week or so in June. Benjamin Andrew \u2013 William Blair & Company:  Okay. And just two housekeeping things, did you said gross margins 200 to 300 bips per quarter, is that corporate or OmniPad? Duane M. DeSisto:  Consolidated. I mean there is a wind up being both because the OmniPad side is certainly driving but on a consolidated basis between 200 bips and 300 bips per quarter. Benjamin Andrew \u2013 William Blair & Company:  Sure. Any change in product pricing or utilization for patient separate as issue in the quarter? Duane M. DeSisto:  No, not really, PODD price continues to kind of hang in very much of 27 to 28 range for its been for the last probably quarters. Utilization teams within the exception of this group of patient to clearly got delayed out of few weeks seems pretty normal. Benjamin Andrew \u2013 William Blair & Company: Okay. And you got $125 million in cash just turned operating profitable and sustainably well. What do you see doing with that, obviously that\u2019s a fair chunk of cash to have sitting around? Duane M. DeSisto:  Yeah, subsequent to June 30, we effectively used about $35 million of that cash, right, $28.8 million to retire effectively the last part of those 3.75% notes that happened on July 28, and the $5 million backed in payment happened with the first week or so of July. So the number bounces back to about $140 million, which is really where we kind of begin the year. And yeah, we\u2019ve got a bunch of initiatives and things on the plate, I mean I put this in the good problem to have categories. So I think we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ll kind of see how the business continues to evolve and develop, and I think you have still debt outstanding, and we\u2019ll kind of continue to monitor or manage against those things. Benjamin Andrew \u2013 William Blair & Company:  Okay. And then last from me, any update on when we might see some human data on your CGM partner? Duane M. DeSisto:  Well, where full systems go, still we\u2019re trying to get ready for human trial here in the beginning part of 2015. So that\u2019s a reasonable timeline to think, but if some of the data will go onside that trail. Benjamin Andrew \u2013 William Blair & Company:  Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jayson Bedford of Raymond James. Your line is open. Michael Rich \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Michael Rich calling in for Jayson. Can you hear me, okay? Duane M. DeSisto:  All right. Michael Rich \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.:  Thanks for taking the questions. I\u2019m not going to ask you about the payor dynamics yet. Duane M. DeSisto:  You can ask me about the 35% growth. Michael Rich \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.:  Well, I was going to ask you about the expanded agreement with Dexcom, it sounds like it\u2019s somewhat depending on their Gen5 timeline, but when are you expecting to file approval for next-gen PDM, I know you were saying, you\u2019d have it displayed at ADA next year, but when do you think you file that, and does that become a PMA, because it will be able to display CGM data or does a cell phone create redundancy that\u2019s huge in your 510(k)? Duane M. DeSisto:  Yeah. So obviously we are going to take that to the FDA to your second question. I think from our standpoint and talking with Dexcom guys, they are at its PMA but our argument would be quite simply that one is going to display that app on the cell phone which is obviously not a FDA regulated device. There seems to be our guess in our logic no reason why our help when we remain 510K. So and I think from my standpoint, I think we\u2019ve spent some time. We talk to lot of people at the agency. As you can imagine, this all these apps and everything went on, the FDA has the people at EBITDA with listening into all from all the stuff. Unfortunately because we have the scholars and FDA and EBITDA. I am sure if there was going to be anything be in this place, there the DFA will have people there. So I think it\u2019s changing fast and furious. I think they\u2019re trying to embrace the new technology. So I think we feel good that we got a very strong argument that why would the handheld be a PMA. And if the handheld does turn out that it has to be a PMA, it\u2019s not really the end of world for us. It only becomes a big problem for us if the Pod were to being PMA. And that\u2019s when we talk about integrating sensing technology into a Pod, that\u2019s why when that time comes, we could have it too perfect. But \u2013 so \u2013 like I said, our belief is, we think it may be a 510(k) because if you can display it on a cell phone, then our next generation product is not all that different from now. So that\u2019s kind of how we\u2019re looking at it. And then \u2013 so I think to your first question, I think the big update for us, and I think we\u2019ll have a very good handle at this, the ADA next June in Boston it\u2019s kind of going to be where we\u2019ll be able to give you really good timeline, hopefully be able to display this next generation product and one of the better, what will have a much better idea where we are in terms of regulatory process in that. So the ADA in Boston next year is in Boston next year, so we are kind of excited by the backup. Being a Boston based company that would be kind of a nice coming out party for us. So that\u2019s, you don\u2019t have to timeline obviously the FDA is a big piece of it. I think we will be in a position to show kind of what we are doing in our product strategy there, and then, the regulatory path, needed regulatory path. Michael Rich \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.:  Okay. That\u2019s helps. Thanks. And then the 20% in your patient adds, even lift this issue in the back half of the quarter is pretty solid but are you seeing anything new on the competitive landscape, tend to had a pretty good quarter, you also mentioned increase activities from another new plans on the space anything maybe you can comment on that. Duane M. DeSisto: I think from my standpoint, and this sounds like a broken record, but we fight for mindshare at the doctor\u2019s office. If we\u2019re given a fair shot, I think \u2013 you know it\u2019s pretty simple, you either want tubing or you don\u2019t want tubing, you don\u2019t want tubing with the product. So we really don\u2019t \u2013 we compete with 800 pounds well in this space and we fight for mindshare space and we fight for mindshare at the doctor\u2019s office which really isn\u2019t product-related. And rest of these guys are in this space, and they\u2019re doing what they\u2019re doing, but that\u2019s really not, the competition is really mindshare at the doctor\u2019s office. Brian K. Roberts: And to the other part of your question, Mike, I\u2019d add that, Duane in his remarks, with the addition of these 20 new sales reps, I mean this is really the first full quarter that they\u2019re kind of out here in the field now, and driving new referrals, and we\u2019re seeing an up tick in the pipeline. I think the sales team overall is very engaged, I think they\u2019re excited about the resources, they\u2019re excited about still then new Pod in their bag, and I think overall we can feel pretty good. So it\u2019s unfortunate that payors is causing a little drop in our kind of patient conversion at the moment to just get some of those people over the goal line, but we believe that\u2019s temporary and the pipeline is still very full. So I think we\u2019re still feeling very bullish about the second half of the year and 20% new patient adds even with this issue given the size of the payor. I think we\u2019re still pretty happy about it. Michael Rich \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.:  Okay. And then just to clarify sort of peggy backing on that, is it fair to assume then that the change in guidance reflects really only this issue and that underlying trends of the business that James told on track with what you expected. Duane M. DeSisto: That is 100% accurate, yes. Michael Rich \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.:  Okay. Great. Thank you for taking the questions. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Robbie Marcus \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC.: Hi, thanks. This is actually Robbie Marcus in for Mike. Hey guys, I was wondering if you could tell us what the new patient starts would have been this quarter if you exclude the payor issue? Duane M. DeSisto:  I mean again, I\u2019d rather not get into taking these numbers and subtracting that, I mean again we\u2019re so far year-to-date, we\u2019re still up about 20% in total, we were on track I think for a solid Q2 as I talked about at previous conferences, and we\u2019re expecting that we\u2019ll be able to kind of continue to hang right at least around this 20% number a little better throughout the back half of the year. Robbie Marcus \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC.:  Okay. So we should assume that the 25% number is now kind of off the table for 2014? Duane M. DeSisto:  Well, I mean again, I think you\u2019ll have to see exactly how this issue resolves and it\u2019s exactly anyone want it resolved, but we\u2019ve adjusted the guidance down, the amount that we think is appropriate to account for this specific issue. Robbie Marcus \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC.:  Okay. And then, even with the issue you guys are coming very close to profitability, how are you thinking about profitability in 2014 versus 2015, are there any benefits were pushing at the 2015 and how should we\u2019ll be thinking about shares and the tax rate once you guys become profitable. Duane M. DeSisto:  Well. We\u2019ve got 55.5 million shares outstanding, there\u2019s certainly some options and other things out there which are all disclosed in the SEC filings, the only other big thing that\u2019s out there is obliviously this new convertible debt issuance that we did in June, so those numbers are all up there. One of the nice things about the convertible debt issuance was that, we effectively were able to take dilution down by about 20% as compared to, if you look at the number of underline shares compared to what the old one was versus the new one. So at some point this thing actually did convert, which its not really not the goal of these. It still would have saved about I think a little over 20% of the original amount of shares where. Here in regards to profitability, again I'll put these into the high class problems right and turning profitable is ultimately a goal. We will get there. We were operating profitably in Q2 if we back out the veteran lawsuit. We\u2019ll continue to be operating profitable for the back half of the year. There is some of this non-cash expense that goes through exactly where it lands. And then \u2013 so they have a lot NOLs we won\u2019t be paying specific writing a check that much for quite a while to come but more to come I guess around tax rate and other things as we get further down the line. Robbie Marcus \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC.:  Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Lichtman of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Steve M. Lichtman \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.: Thank you. Hi guys. I guess first question on the pipeline opportunities. Have you guys have talked about additional indications potentially with Amgen specifically. Any of them when we could hear on that and then also potentially other partnerships. When could we potentially hear on that front as well? Brian K. Roberts: Sure. It\u2019s Brian. So on answer like I mentioned earlier really is going very well. I don\u2019t think, I think its fair to assume and I think we set this price previously that\u2019s fair to assume that until this final one gets over the goal line completing, we are actually get it into the marketplace, we are not going to really move forward with additional project until that point in time. Several conversations with those guys, we feel like there is some good opportunity is there and believe the partnership will expand. But obviously getting off the start line here on this first one in the positive manner will go a long way to making sure that those happenings. That said, sense really the press release in announcing the answered partnership. We\u2019d had lot of inbounding asking to us asking about our product several meetings, several calls, several different I\u2019d say kind of regulatory agreements in place where were we were working on other initiatives now, and has some other interesting things here in the pipeline. Duane M. DeSisto:  And I think, as Brian described here, I think it\u2019s the point now that we\u2019re actually out actively recruiting the business development person for that business. So we now have, why I said, I think we described this before the phone rang, we answered, the phone is ringing a lot, so we\u2019re actually taking next step, we\u2019re going to invest the money in terms of the business development person to help us start kind of \u2013 looking at these opportunity size in the month. So we\u2019re excited about it, it seems to be a significant line of interest, I guess we\u2019re ready now to invest in terms of another person, and the guys have been doing, and they\u2019re doing a great job, it\u2019s now \u2013 it\u2019s now \u2013 even more feet on the street to really start qualifying this. Steve M. Lichtman \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.:  I got, and then international obviously showing great growth, where have you guys been successful so far, and where do you see some of the biggest opportunities geographically, I mean just a \u2013 comment around from the way you\u2019re seeing that, that international business looking forward? Duane M. DeSisto:  So I think, our partner internationally, Ypsomed, they\u2019re throughout most of western Europe, they continue to take market share \u2013 penetrate the markets, the obvious big ones, the Scandinavian countries, Germany, they kind to the way \u2013 we just \u2013 they just launched in Italy, while that\u2019s not a major market, it did subside. I think the two opportunities that we continue to press forward with them on is, we\u2019re going through the process in France, which is a very big market, very good reimbursements. So we haven\u2019t had dime one out of France yet. And then the other obvious one I think is in China, that has a \u2013 kind of very healthy insulin pump business. I think if you look at a company like Novo and some of the insulin suppliers and see how much money comes out of the Pacific Rim, it\u2019s pretty surprising how big that business. So we do think those are the two big opportunities both of which in France we are in the hopefully, I would say hopefully here because we\u2019ve probably been in the couple of times, but we think we are in the final stages with Ypsomed in terms of getting reimbursement and in China we continue to work our way through their SFDA some of that\u2019s kind of. Steve M. Lichtman \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.:  Okay. Great. And then just lastly on the new sales that you\u2019ve brought on board in the first half with 20 new people, when did they hit the ground and they\u2019ve \u2013 when do you start expecting the start producing similar trends, so we start seeing some effect in the back half of the year. Duane M. DeSisto: Yeah, I mean, of the 20 people basically half of them hit the ground first week of May, the other half hit the ground first week of June. So, again they averaged half a quarter basically just the amount of time they probably learned how to drive to the various places they were going to right, but even with that we did see a little bit of an uptick in these Key Account Manager territories versus if you will standard territories. They were up about 10% in the \u2013 one versus the other, which is a positive and we\u2019re still seeing that momentum going into Q3. So, yeah I believe we will see some positive impact out of these folks in the back half of the year. Steve M. Lichtman \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.:  Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Mimi Pham of ABR Healthco. Your line is open. Mimi Pham \u2013 ABR Healthco : Good afternoon. On the managed care issue. Is there any implication related impacts for your pending Type 2 launch next year? Duane M. DeSisto:  Mimi, that\u2019s a great question. And I think you remember what we said, time and time again is, is I\u2019m not sure just having the Type 2 pump and going into that marketplace that you\u2019d ever get reimbursement for. When we go with Lilly with the drug, we were a full blown clinical results, and this is a subset of Type 2 patients that are highly insulin resistant, and typically have failed at everything else. So we feel confident, we think the hurdle, the medical necessity hurdle will be \u2013 or there will be a lot of that, but we\u2019re pretty confident that, this is kind of the last stop on the train to these patients, and it would be very well received. But I think you have to go at it, once again, as we think about how big diabetes is, how expensive it is, it has the potential to bankrupt the United States as well as the rest of the world; I think you have to go out at the real clinical \u2013 I think that\u2019s kind of how we propose that from day one. Mimi Pham \u2013 ABR Healthco :  Okay. And then regarding \u2013 Dexcom last week during their earnings call said that they were ending their ending their CGM program because of technology failure to human testing. So it seems like this might add more risk to your Pod and CGM. Are you thinking about working with DexCom on the? Duane M. DeSisto: I think for us we would take nothing of the table. We would work with anyone that obviously has a sensor. I think the last step of DexCom we wanted to do short-term and we continue to talk everybody about what we wanted to long-term. Having said that, I think where we are just to understand what our mindset is. We really do believe that\u2019s reality issue, now that we think there are products out there they can survive this reality issue. We do think that this all-in-one app, I guess we think about where medicines selling, we are talking about basically having a sensor added to our product and we have the base, we have the insertion system, we have the power, we have to do engagement. We think this will be an incredibly cost effective way to incorporate -operate for insulin dependent patience into a Pod and we are approaching it cautiously. We are not running down the street, we think we get it all work now, but we are listening and talking to everybody we have tested everybody sensors. We are moving forward and talking to all of those guys we think that this is the work with and we still think standard of care someday is going to be one thing on the body and one thing either on your phone or one your hand. Mimi Pham \u2013 ABR Healthco :  Last with Medtronic I don\u2019t know it\u2019s not going to pursue a disposal pump anymore, is that helping at all the fields first maybe some and those who wanted to stick with Medtronic given, they can durable today and down the road disposal, where they you talked about. Duane M. DeSisto: Yeah, once again I think it\u2019s depends on the particular and I am not going to say it does not help, I think from our standpoint, I think what\u2019s pretty competitive in the marketplace is filing mind share with these guys in the office. They will more since whatever the new messages and they will go back into those offices with whatever the new message is. And so like I said I think from our standpoint, we heard them, okay I\u2019ll take the mapping words at the time being and what we are going to driving hard and as far as we are concern this still the guys to be. Mimi Pham \u2013 ABR Healthco :  Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jan Wald of Benchmark. Your line is now open. Jan Wald \u2013 The Benchmark Company, LLC.: Good afternoon everyone. A couple of short questions most everything else has been asked and answered. I guess, one thing is you are looking for margin improvement on the second half of the year. What makes you feel comfortable that you are actually going to be able to achieve the goal that you set for yourselves? Duane M. DeSisto:  Yeah, I mean most of it is, at this point from our perspective relatively locked and loaded, we\u2019ve continue to work with our supply chain on the bill of materials as we continue to work our way up the volume curve. We\u2019ve got some \u2013 a very clear path on kind of reduced, continuing to take costs out of product, which should drive us the additional, call it 400 or 500, 600 basis points of gross margin that we should see in the back half of the year. Jan Wald \u2013 The Benchmark Company, LLC.:  Okay. And just on the sales force, can you comment \u2013 it looks like you had a pretty nice bump in \u2013 moreover they were located and working \u2013 how should we understand that going forward \u2013 is the 10% bump kind of a bump or is it something that you continually leverage overtime \u2013 and you see that your Key Account Managers getting into a larger proportion of the accounts that you have or how do you see that program building? Duane M. DeSisto:  Look, it\u2019s great question. I think from our standpoint, right now we\u2019re sitting back watching the testing, we like everything we see, but I think we had said, what drove us to this particular decision last year we had tested it in one particular area, just to make sure that this was the right approach. And then, so what really kind of drive this with some of these key accounts is, when you see the sales reps that had a great deal of success and they can no longer expand beyond their current installed base, because there is a correlation between spending time in the doctor\u2019s office and really developing a relationship with them. So, we are going to watch it, we are going to continue to watch it and it is a program that I think over time we will continue to expand if we keep seeing the results fits in. Jan Wald \u2013 The Benchmark Company, LLC.:  Do you see the, I mean, how you are using the key account managers, are they going into your largest most important accounts at this point or once have you seen sort of a gross slowdown because the sales people they have already gotten to the point where they taken much further. Duane M. DeSisto:  The way we are working is, we\u2019ve had sales reps go into a territory been widely successful. All of a sudden, 50% or 60% of \u2013 40% of their business is coming out of three accounts. What you see is the territories that the sales rep has to back-off and spend more and more time in there. So what we are doing with those accounts is, we\u2019re bringing in this person to maintain that relationship, maintain the Insulet relationship with them and free it up. So what really is, we have a clinical specialist, which is key to all this, because educators want to deal with clinical specialists. Then the Key Account Manager really becomes the farmer, and the sales rep goes back being a humper in the territory. And we can do that, because I think we\u2019ve been at it long enough, in every territory we have 20 top accounts, and then the next 20 accounts, we evaluate where business is coming from, we evaluate how much time the sales person is spending in those particular accounts. And so we\u2019ve kind of developed a little bit of a model that we think\u2013 we can see the relationship between time spend, orders coming out of the office, what the potential of the office is and that\u2019s how we kind of drove the first handful key account managers. And like I said once again we are monitoring it, if it continues to be a successful program obviously, we will roll out in other areas. Jan Wald \u2013 The Benchmark Company, LLC.:  Thanks a lot and congratulations on the 35%. Duane M. DeSisto: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from William Plovanic of Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. William Plovanic \u2013 Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Just two detail questions. One is intermodeling, one is \u2013 you\u2019ve trying to gave generalities for the international growth year-over-year what \u2013 was it up 100%, 50%, 75% or nominal dollar amount can you give us an idea where that is? And then my second question it is all modeling related is, roughly what was the old NDI business in the quarter. And that\u2019s all I have, thanks. Duane M. DeSisto:  Yeah, I mean, I\u2019ve taken all the neighborhood business was effectively flat with where they were in Q1, and the international guys, the international that fleet on pace the double for the full year. So that\u2019s where that kind of continuing the track and probably been getting more specific than that. William Plovanic \u2013 Canaccord Genuity, Inc.:  Okay, great. And see you next week. Duane M. DeSisto: You, bet. Brian K. Roberts: Thanks, Bill. Operator : Thank you. There are no more questions in the queue at this time. Duane M. DeSisto: Thanks, everyone, for joining us today and we look forward to updating you with our Q3. Have a good night. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s call Brian Roberts, CFO. Sir, please begin. Brian K. Roberts: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2014 conference call. I\u2019m Brian Roberts, Chief Financial Officer of Insulet, and joining me on the call today is Patrick Sullivan, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Allison Dorval our Vice President and Controller.

You\u2019ll find a link to the webcast of this call, as well as to today\u2019s press release, at myomnipod.com in the Investors section. And now, let me take a minute to introduce you to Patrick Sullivan. As you know Pat joined Insulet on September 17 as President and CEO and brings to Insulet over 30 years of Executive leadership experience including a 13 year period as Chairman, President and CEO of Cytyc Corporation. Pat led Cytyc to exceptional growth as revenues increased from $4 million to more than $750 million through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions culminating in its acquisition by Hologic in 2007. His leadership and experience is a great addition to Insulet as the company enters its next phase of growth. Welcome aboard Pat. Patrick J. Sullivan : Thanks, Brian and good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us on the call today. I\u2019m very excited and honored to have the opportunity to work with such an innovative and progressive company. Over the last 50 days I\u2019ve had the opportunity to gain a much deeper understanding of our company, the industry and the opportunities that lie ahead. As I learn more, my enthusiasm for this business and its future continues to grow. I\u2019m looking forward to finishing out 2014 and driving our strategic initiatives in 2015 and beyond. As we look towards 2015, its clear that we are building off a very solid foundation as the existing business continues to perform. We delivered $70 million of topline revenue in the third quarter representing a 23% increase year-over-year. In my short time here, I\u2019ve been impressed with the passion of our commercial team as they continued to build our presence with both the existing and new healthcare practices to drive adoption of the OmniPod. Our product helps people improve control over their diabetes providing them the freedom to enjoy life. In fact, about 70% of our initial patient starts are new to insulin pumping. These customers report that the easy to use water proof and tubeless design is appealing as they gained the benefits of insulin pumping without the hassle of conventional pumps. This is especially true in the age 18 and under group. Approximately 40% of our new patient starts in the third quarter or in this important age group. While our annualized attrition continues at a rate of about 9% we know that the rate of attrition in those 18 and under is only about 5%. Once kids and their parents experience the freedom of the OmniPod they do not change. Critical to our ability to convert multiple daily injectors to the OmniPod is for us to deepen our relationship with endocrinologist and clinical diabetes educators. In addition to discreet size the pod, healthcare professionals continue to cite the updated insulin on board calculator, the simplicity of a low assembly system and life style convenience as the key reasons why they prescribe the product. They clearly expect our sales professionals to be readily available to assist them as required in adopting the OmniPod. To that end over this year we added approximately 20 new commercial team members to increase our presence and ability to serve healthcare professionals. We\u2019ve added a new role that we refer to as Key Account Manager or KAMS who are permanently passed with ensuring a high level of customer service to critical existing accounts, which will allow our territory sales reps to spend more time with new prescribers. The early returns for these new resources are positive. Territories with Cams have experienced a 15% average increase from referrals since we added them in Q2. As these resources continue to gain experience, we believe overall productivity will increase further and expect we will add additional commercial resources early next year. Last quarter, you will recall that we discussed an issue with a significant payor who made changes to the Insulin pump coverage guidelines which were not eliminating reimbursement for the OmniPod did cause a lot of confusion across the country. Over the past few months, we have worked diligently with this payer and our distributor partner to serve this payer to rectify the problem. We are pleased to report that we believe the issue is behind us and will not impact new patient starts in 2015. The payors revised its process in a manner that we believe will both eliminate the confusion surrounding OmniPod reimbursement eligibility and keep OmniPod consistent with traditional insulin pumps in terms of required documentation. The payor is currently rolling out to revise process and forms and given the timing of the roll out we expect new patient starts to be impacted through Q4 but declining with a declining impact each month. On the international side our business our business continues to grow as well as we remain on track to double for calendar year 2014. As many of you may have seen our European partner, Ypsomed released a six month results ended September 30, 2014 last week. Those results showed a 60% sales increase for the OmniPod system driving nearly all of the growth in the direct diabetes business. And looking at the success we see continuous share gains across Europe with countries such as the Netherlands, Austria, the U.K. and Switzerland in the mid to upper teens. And as we look forward, we believe the opportunity for growth remains high as Ypsomed continues to add share in other markets such as Germany, Sweden, Finland and opens new market such as Italy which we lost last quarter and France which we hope to launch early next year once reimbursement is secured. Although we generate lower gross margins on our international partnerships this business continues to drive our operating margin improvement as increased revenues require only minimal incremental operating expenses. In Q3, we manufactured more than 3 million pods for the first time in a quarter, and more importantly the quality of the product from Flextronics has never been higher as yields have improved to greater than 98%. This improved quality has translated to reduced cost through our customer support team and higher confidence in the field. We are in the process of finishing line for Flextronics and expect to put it in service early next year. Additionally, our record production drove incremental gross margin improvement in the quarter as U.S. product margins are now in the low 60s and consolidated gross margins increased by more than a 100 basis points to 51%. On a consolidated basis gross margins continued to be impacted slightly by product mix within our neighborhood subsidiary and increasing international market share. Overall, we have improved gross margins by more than 700 basis points since the new OmniPod was launched. Gross margins will continue to improve in the fourth quarter as additional OmniPod cost savings further reduce the cost per pod. I\u2019m very impressed with our manufacturing capabilities endured as one of our core competencies. And in our deed we need to continue to enhance our existing product or development, new products that meet the customer needs. I\u2019ve spend a significant amount of my time to date at Insulet gaining a full understanding of our research and development efforts. At the top of the priority list is our new PDM initiative. The goal of this new PDM is to provide our users with more modern looking touch screen devices that with a cleaner user interface as well as incorporate blue tooth capabilities to allow us to solve some of the data management challenges facing the industry today. We see the blue tooth capability as one of the most important enhancements as it will allow two way communications with other platforms such as Dexcom\u2019s chair platform recently approved by the FDA. Once the PDM is approved we look forward to sharing data with Dexcom to allow our common users improve data viewing capabilities. While the work on our PDM moves forward, we are also making progress in our activities to integrate a CGM sensor into the OmniPod. I\u2019m particularly interested in this long term initiative as it is clear that a one item on the body and one hand held solution is very attractive for our customers, healthcare professionals and managed care payors alike. We\u2019re the only company with a capability to bring these two tremendous technologies into one easy to use platform. We\u2019ve recently completed additional testing around proximity of sensing and dispensing that gives us increased confidence in our integrated CGM solution. During the quarter, we also received feedback from the FDA regarding our planned approach in partnership with Eli Lilly for our OmniPod system specifically designed for use with U-500 insulin. Our initial approach with Lilly was for us to file our 510(k) gain approval and then complete our clinical trial with -- to update their labeling. The FDA however has informed us that they now prefer the clinical trial to be completed prior to our F 510(k) submission. We are working closely with Lilly to revise the timeline for our clinical study and to file for clearance. We anticipate the clinical commuting mid next year. There is a number of highly resistant people living with type-2 diabetes is increasing daily, the need for this product continues to grow and both companies remain committed and enthusiastic about this project. Finally, last week Amgen publicly discussed the first time the Neulasta on-body delivery system that leverages the OmniPod technology. This one of a kind system will allow a patient to leave the doctors office with an activated delivery device programmed to deliver relapse of the following day. We are working closely with Amgen for their approval and subsequent launch of this product. In addition to Amgen and our ongoing partnership with Ferring pharmaceuticals, our newest partner Capricor Therapeutics announced last month to start a clinical program for the drug and Cenderitide to treat post acute heart fail using our drug delivery system. We will provide product development, product management and design control activities in partnership with Capricor in addition to providing clinical product for their clinical trial. We look forward to assisting in this exciting opportunity. With those comments let me turn the call back to Brian for additional details on our financial performance. Brian K. Roberts: Thanks Pat. Consolidated revenue increased by 23% year-over-year to $75 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2014 from $61.1 million in the same period last year. For the nine months of 2014 consolidated revenue was $216.2 million compared to $178.6 million for the first nine months of 2013 a year-over-year increase of 21%.  Gross profit increased by 39% in the third quarter to $38 million as compared to a gross profit of $27.4 million in the third quarter of last year. Consolidated gross margins of 51% represent a 600 basis point improvement over the third quarter of 2013. As we look towards the fourth quarter and early 2015, we expect further improvements in our consolidated gross margins through a combination of additional component price reductions and incremental overhead leverage with the start of the fourth manufacturing line. Gross profit for the first nine months of 2014 was $106.6 million, an increase of $27.2 million or 34% as compared to $79.4 million in the first nine months of 2013. Operating expenses decreased by $3.8 million or 8% year-over-year to $40.9 million in the third quarter of 2014 from $44.7 million in the prior year. This quarter\u2019s operating expenses include approximately $7 million of compensation charges related to the CEO transition in September most of which is non cash. Excluding those charges operating expenses would have been about $34 million in Q3. Last years third quarter operating expenses also included approximately $10 million of one time charges related to the settlement of the patent litigation of Medtronics. Fourth quarter operating expenses are expected to be in a range of $36 million to $39 million including approximately $3 million of remaining stock compensation charges associated with the CEO transition. Operating expense were $116.7 million for the first nine months of 2014 compared to $108.7 million for the first nine months of 2013. Operating loss was $2.9 million compared to $17.3 million in the prior year, an improvement of over 80%. Excluding the one-time compensation charges, we would have reported an operating profit of approximately $4 million in the third quarter of 2014. Interest and other expense was $7.9 million in the third quarter compared to $4 million last year. In June, we issued approximately $201 million of 2% convertible senior notes maturing in June 2019, and used approximately $160 million of the net proceeds to repurchase the $115 million of the outstanding 3.75% notes that were due in June of 2016. In July, we retired the remaining outstanding 3.75% notes in exchange for $28.8 million in cash and approximately 350,000 shares of common stock. We recorded a loss on the extinguishment of debt of approximately $4.3 million in the third quarter relating to that transaction. Net interest and other expense was $35.9 million for the first nine months of 2014 including a total of approximately $23 million of expense related to the early extinguishment of the 3.75% convertible senior notes. That compares to $12.9 million for the first nine months of 2013. Going forward, we expect to record interest expense related to the 2% notes of approximately $3 million per quarter comprised of $1 million in cash interest expense and $2 million in non-cash interest expense. Excluding the impact of the extinguishment of debt and the one-time compensation charges they reached breakeven results of the net income line and on an earnings per share basis in the third quarter of 2014. Including these items our net loss for the third quarter was $10.8 million or $0.19 per share as compared to net loss of $21.3 million or $0.39 per share for the third quarter of last year. Net loss for the first nine months of 2014 was $46.1 million or $0.83 per share compared to $42.5 million or $0.79 per share for the first nine months of 2013. Our cash and cash equivalents balance was $146.4 million at September 30 compared to $149.7 million at December 31. As of September 30, we had approximately 56 million common shares outstanding. Turning to guidance, we have further refined our 2014 revenue expectations to $292 million to $297 million translating to a range of expected revenue of $76 million to $81 million for the fourth quarter. That takes into consideration the impact of the payer issue we\u2019ve discussed. Lastly, after six rewarding years, I\u2019ve made the difficult decision to resign my position at Insulet. I\u2019m very proud of all that has been accomplished over my time here including a 10x increase revenue from approximately $30 million in 2008 and only $300 million this year, and even larger increase in market cap to over $2.2 billion and achieving operating profitability. More importantly, I\u2019ve had the privilege to speak with many of our customers and see the impact we\u2019re making their life each and every day and to work with an incredibly talented team of people. It\u2019s with even greater pride that I turn the CFO range over the Allison Dorval, who has been my right hand since by first day. Many of you have the opportunity to meet Allison in various investor conferences over the past couple of years and I\u2019m more than confident that she would do a tremendous job for you, our shareholders, our customers and our colleagues. I\u2019ll stay as an employee of Insulet through the end of the year to ensure smooth transition. And with that, operator, please open the call for questions Operator : (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy from Leerink Partners. Please with our question. Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Partners : Thanks so much. Good afternoon, guys and let me start by saying Brian, you will very much be missed, but Allison congratulations, I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re there, but looking forward to working with you more closely and also welcome aboard Pat, looking forward to getting to know you better. Maybe I start with sort of how was your first 50 days has been, any thing surprising? What\u2019s your initial read of the company and the potential long-term growth trajectory here? Brian Roberts : Well, as I \u2013 when I joined the company back in September, I was working excited about the technology and the opportunity that this product can make a better mix in the lives of patients that use it. And I guess what I\u2019ve learned over the last 50 years that it is more exciting than when I joined. I\u2019m very existed about the product, the technology and really focus on market adoption of this technology for anyone with Type 1 diabetes. This organization is tremendously focused on capitalizing on this opportunity and I\u2019m very excited to be here and also congratulate Allison on her promotion to CFO and spending some time on the road with her meeting all of you. Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Partners : Great. Thanks for that. And then Pat, I was hoping, or Brian I was hoping to get a little bit more granularity on the [UNA] issue and revolution there. Guys, can you talk about number one, what that equates you in annual sales in your view? If I remember correctly I think you characterize it previously in the $10 million to $50 million range, so if you could confirm that? And then also sort of what gives you the confidence that the issue at rest and no longer an issues. Brian Roberts : Yes. Danielle, it\u2019s Brian, so thank for that, thank you for your warm words. Initial I can tell over the last few months, the team has worked extremely hard and there\u2019s been a lot of conversations have happened between the payer, the distributor and internally we try to ultimately figure what was the best way to resolve it. I think in the end we come through with a couple of changes specifically around this, form that we had talked about previously that will allow for a brand name of the product to be included on the form which should allow to be able to eliminate I think all of the confusion that existed in the marketplace. So, we\u2019re pleased with that. As you can imagine with any change that needs to go through large organization that\u2019s take a little for it to go through, and so, that\u2019s why we continue to expect that we\u2019ve seen for example, in October -- still some impact on the new patients starts front. But it seem like that will dwindle now over the course of the coming weeks and we think it will be a non-issue as we turn the calendar year into 2015. As we talk about last quarter, we have built in to the change in the revenue guidance, the full impact to this for the full year and I think as we given the guidance for this quarter of $76 million to $81 million, that\u2019s including all of the impacts that we expect to have in Q4 as well. Obviously, as you think forward to 2015 there will be reorder impact because those people won\u2019t have started yet or they have just started, but I think we\u2019ll be able mitigate most of it. Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Partners : All right. Thanks so much. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Raj Denhoy \u2013 Jefferies: Hi, good afternoon. Maybe I was talking little bit on Danielle\u2019s question, but with so much change in the senior management over such a short period of time variable it will raise questions and people will ask whether there is something perhaps more to this than simply Brian you moving on and the Board wanted to make a change at the CO levels. So I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything else you can maybe offer those Pat or Brian about share amount of change at the senior level in such a short period of time? Brian Roberts : I can tell you from my side Raj, for me and I\u2019ve obviously been here in Insulet for about six years. It\u2019s been a great ride. I\u2019d loved every minute of this company and I remained very passionate about what we do and what we do and how we help folks. You see it every single day I can give you an example of running into a kid on my son\u2019s 10-year old basketball team this pass weekend. And that doesn\u2019t change for me. For me personally it was \u2013 I started to have some conversations earlier this year, thinking about what was next and what was the right time for me to potentially take on additional opportunities and see if they\u2019re either here at Insulet or elsewhere. And this just seems like the appropriate time for me to kind of make that next step of transition and move on. I think Pat, I can tell you for being here the last 50 days and watching Pat in action. He spend inordinate amount of time getting to know people, getting to know this company, not jump in the conclusions, really trying to understand what\u2019s going on here and I think his track records speak for himself and he\u2019s going to make a very, very positive impact in this business. And so, I look forward to still being here for the next couple of months and helping the company through and then watching it from the side lines, but obviously have some very vested interest and how the business continues to do with this lot of relationships from me both internally and externally and I wanted to exceed. Patrick Sullivan : Yes. And I guess, I would say that I\u2019ve been very impress with the organization since I joint 50 days ago and for me it was an opportunity as I\u2019d say to some of my friends, I just went to retirement and decided to get back into the saddle and really enjoy running \u2013 I enjoyed running slide deck and I\u2019m enjoying doing what I\u2019m doing here. And I think the opportunities are similar, that there are challenges in every organization, but there are certain things that we can do better, and I\u2019m focused on converting this market to Standard of Care with the OmiPad product. I think it\u2019s an exciting technology. There are obviously obstacles and you have knocked down one at a time, but we\u2019re focused on making that happen. Raj Denhoy \u2013 Jefferies: Great. Maybe I can ask two specific follow-up questions. First to you Pat. You\u2019ve talked about \u2013 you\u2019ve talk about diabetes but less about perhaps drug delivery and that seems to have been perhaps an involving part of the story that could potentially get larger, much larger over time and I\u2019m curious if you any thoughts around that? Might be the timeline that sounds or perhaps lengthen a little bit in terms of Amgen deal and also the Type 2 products, so I don\u2019t know if there anything you comment around that? Patrick Sullivan : I would say, as I\u2019ve gotten into the company and understand the technology and particular the Amgen deal, I think the opportunity to leverage the existing technology in the drug delivery business is quite frankly huge, and Amgen is the first really significant opportunity I think to capitalize on that opportunity. And I \u2013 we\u2019re looking at making additional investments in the whole drug delivery side, because I think from a revenue perspective it can be potentially a very large number. Brian Roberts : And Raj, it\u2019s Brian. I do have a couple of things. One, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything that we said so far that you should takeaway thing, the timeline for the Amgen product has changed. If anything the fact that on their earnings call last week they presented this new product, talk about it first time publicly, showed the picture of the product. If anything I think shows that they\u2019re feeling extremely confident that we\u2019re going to get to the finish line and our timeline on that has always been thinking that they were going to have a Q4 approval and Q4 has done yet. In the Lilly case, we\u2019ve originally been working towards a plan where we would be able to file the 10-K and get clearance and Lilly wanted to use cleared product to drive the clinical. The FDA provide us some feedback as we are working through them kind of collaboratively around human factor testing that they wanted us to just reverse that and kind of do in the different order. So, it is different and that we won\u2019t have to file 10-K file which would have allowed us to potentially sell a little bit on the side, while Lilly was going through their process that said, from the overall timeline of the product that\u2019s really not changed, it just reordered. Raj Denhoy \u2013 Jefferies: Okay. And then, sorry, just last one, just on gross margins, you mentioned low 60% for the U.S. How much more is left there? I think you have talked about kind of getting into the low 60s with the Gen2 where the current generation pod, how much left do you think there is in driving that gross margin higher? Brian Roberts : Personally I think there\u2019s a lot of that. I mean, I think that there is \u2013 I\u2019m sure at some point there\u2019s a theoretical feeling, but I said to different people at different times. I certainly I\u2019m not willing to \u2013 you put us feeling on our ability to gain leverage in the business. I mean, we should be able to continue to drive as the business gets bigger and bigger and we add more lines, more and more efficiencies that should be able to drive the cost of different components done and be able to spread out the overhead even more. And so, I think as we looked at this quarter, we gained a couple hundred basis points on the U.S. OmniPod basis. We lost a little bit on our consolidated margin when you look at international share in the neighborhood mix. I think when we look at Q4 to gain a couple of hundred points more of margin, it\u2019s absolutely achievable. And hopefully all of that close to the consolidated, but again, that will just depend a little bit upon mix of the different components of the business. Raj Denhoy \u2013 Jefferies: That\u2019s helpful, and you will be miss, Brian. Thanks. Brian Roberts : Thanks, Raj. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew from William Blair. Your line is now open. Ben Andrew - William Blair : Good afternoon. And I\u2019ll add my congratulations and also to everybody that\u2019s staying with the company, and Brian, we will miss you. Two questions I guess from me, first, can you talk a little bit about the new patient add trajectory in Q3 and what\u2019s implied in Q4, was it plus minus 20% or whatever detail you can give us there. And then, what\u2019s the neighborhood diabetes revenue number for the quarter or maybe a percentage there if we can? Thanks. Brian Roberts : Yes, sure, Ben, it\u2019s Brian. So a couple of things in new patients starts, I think as Pat mentioned in his remarks I think we\u2019re seeing some nice productivity uptick for the new territories where we\u2019ve added the provable third man in form of kind of this KAM or territory associate kind of role. Overall, we saw probably somewhere about 5% to 10% sequential increase in new patient starts from Q2 to Q3. Still on the trajectory I would tell you a kind of somewhere in the 15% to 20% range overall, new patients starts year-over-year and the trajectory still seems very solid here as where month and few days into the fourth quarter. So I think everybody is feeling good about that and obviously the payer issue kind of being put to bed. I think allows everybody to feel that much more confident as we end this year and look forward into 2015. On the neighborhood side, neighborhood, obviously we lapse competitive bidding this year in the third quarter that was July 1 of 2013 when CMS kind of really significantly reduced the pricing of blood glucose testing supplies. The neighborhood business was up slightly in Q3 on year-over-year basis, probably a couple percentage points. Again, absolutely kind of filling their role and doing a good job, only difference as we have seen in settling a gross margin basis has come down a little bit as the mix of the business has changed and obviously the lower pricing overall from blood glucose testing strips. Ben Andrew - William Blair : Okay. And then Pat maybe a question for you that I think we\u2019ve all kind of looked at over the years, why is \u2013 given that only 30% of people are using insulin pumps there is obviously reasons for that. What do you think is the bottlenecks to adoption that Insulet can address them here that perhaps it wasn\u2019t addressing effectively before and what are the real levers that you guys can bring operationally to try to accelerate that? Patrick J. Sullivan : I think there is a number of atleast my initial read on the whole insulin market are Type 1 diabetes market. You have certainly those that are in the multiple daily injections and mostly patients start out in that therapy and then move over to being considered for pump and pump therapy. And I think as we\u2019ve done market research into the market, it appears that there is a large number of MDI patients that would never consider a pump if they had to use the current conventional pumps, but when provided with the opportunity to use OmniPod the uptake or the interest level is exceedingly high. So I would say what we need to do is focus on the marketing message through the endocrinologists and getting more MDI patients converted to the OmniPod technology. So I think from my perspective, it\u2019s really leveraging the -- sales force presence in the field and focusing on those high prescribers. And as I said earlier if you look at the number of patients below 18 this is where the product really I think is very good for the kids and their parents to manage these patients with type-1 diabetes. So focusing on that market segment I think will pay great dividends. Ben Andrew - William Blair : Were the things the company wasn\u2019t doing effectively before from that marketing message to end those or is this just simply going to require a fair bit more of spending whether at times sales people or marketing dollars to accomplish. Patrick J. Sullivan : Well I think its fair to say that in order to grow we\u2019re going to have to add sales and marketing resources to get the message out and to have adequate coverage in the market place. When I compare sort of what we spent at Cytyc at the same level of $300 million in revenue versus where we are today, at Cytyc we spend more in sales and marketing and I think we need to make some investments in sales and marketing to really to ramp the sales number. Brian Roberts :  I\u2019m not prepared to give you exactly what that looks like today because I\u2019m still more struggling to do that process, but I think it\u2019s fair to say that we\u2019re going to add additional sales from marketing resources. Ben Andrew - William Blair : Great. Thank you. Operator :  Our next question comes from the line of Bill Plovanic from Canaccord. Please proceed with your question. William J. Plovanic \u2013 Canaccord Genuity, Inc: Thanks, good evening. Can you hear me okay. Patrick J. Sullivan : Hey Bill, how are you? William J. Plovanic \u2013 Canaccord Genuity, Inc: Good. So I\u2019m on the airport side there\u2019s some background noise. You know saying welcome Pat, congrats to Allison and Brian definitely missed. Most of my questions have been asked but this time I\u2019m going to ask more pointed questions. Just it sounds you are kind of still viewing things that sounds like but as we think about 2015 and the current revenue expectations and even profitability expectations out there, I mean should we \u2013 can we [casually] say you are comfortable with that, it sounds like maybe from an operating standpoint maybe some more investments in sales and marketing, I know you are still 50 days in getting in there, but how should we start thinking about as you put your stamp on the business from 2015 and beyond? Brian Roberts : Hey Bill, it\u2019s Brian. Let me take a first crack at some of it and I think we\u2019re prepared certainly the company as we get into the first quarter will ultimately provide appropriate guidance for \u201915 but I think there is a couple of takeaways. One is, we\u2019ve been adding sales resources as we know and kind of these 20 person or so kind of chunks, because it works well from a historically from a manufacturing side for not over taxing the sales management and the infrastructure of the business the reimbursement pieces and the like. And that has worked really well and so again I think one of the things to take away is this kind of again third man in or so that we have put into some of these territories, assuming that although early days keep in mind these folks have only been in the field now for one full quarter. They seem to have some good momentum and productivity behind them that I think is something that the team it works through strategic planning and budgeting here in Q4. It\u2019s really trying to figure out how that model works and do we add more \u2013 there are certain territory level where it doesn\u2019t isn\u2019t as effective and really kind of what that planning is. And a lot of the marketing type things you will recall six months ago or so we talked about we hired for the first time an agency of record and digitized to able to come in here and help drive the branding and help I think really push messaging into the healthcare professional community, that talks about pumps make sense for multiple daily injectors, we need to move them on the pumps and this is how you do it. And I think all of that stuff is resonating and as for me one of the things that I shared with Pat when he started was a call -- this in my mind is a really great time for him to kind and join because in a lot of ways it\u2019s the first chance that this business has had in a long time to play off and its versus [Indiscernible] as you guys know from following this company for a long time we were worried about how running made its action capacity with the old part and now I\u2019m going to try to work at getting then new part approved and then the transition of the customer base which took up a big chunk of last year and then this year now we are putting in those building blocks into place. And I think if anything some of the momentum of what\u2019s been invested here over the last six to nine months is starting to show some of those dividends. And so I think that\u2019s a really exciting thing to be. You know that said, and Bill I think Pat as he kind of keeps that in kind of starts to allude to it, there are absolutely things we can do better. And I think his leadership and his commercial experience and what he\u2019s been through along with Pete [Douglin] and his team and the planning effort they are will drive a lot of what makes some of those new investments look like next year. Patrick J. Sullivan : Yes I think what Brian just discussed and I would also say that I\u2019ve spend the majority of my time over the last 50 days being mostly internally focused inside the understanding, manufacturing R&D and then our commercial efforts, but now I\u2019m turning my attention to spending more time in the field with the field force and over the next couple of months getting a good flavor of how we execute the sales strategy in the field and would come back here early next year with my assessments and plans for 2015. William J. Plovanic \u2013 Canaccord Genuity, Inc: Fair enough thank you. And then some -- questions, just on the I was wondering with the Amgen can you quantify what you believe that market opportunity is and when do we actually start seeing that show up in the business? Patrick J. Sullivan : Well Neulasta for Amgen is about $4 billion product in the United States. There are I think as I\u2019ve done the research about 900,000 patients are used at right every year and it currently in its current form is approved by the FDA. This filing is for use of that product and our OmniPod. I would say it we will assuming it gets approved in the fourth quarter or early next year we expect to receive revenue from it, but its hard to really put a number on the table because it all depends upon how that launch goes for Amgen but I know that they are extremely excited about and we are working very hard with them for a very successful launch. William J. Plovanic \u2013 Canaccord Genuity, Inc: Okay. And then secondly just you mentioned the new PDM that you are looking to come out with what do you expect the timing for that product. Patrick J. Sullivan : We expect to show that PDM at the ADA Meeting in the next summer in Boston, so we are going to have a coming out party in our home town with that product and would expect to file that in early 2016. William J. Plovanic \u2013 Canaccord Genuity, Inc: But you will show that ADA but you will file the PMA \u2013 I\u2019m sorry the 510(k) in early 2016? Patrick J. Sullivan : Correct. William J. Plovanic \u2013 Canaccord Genuity, Inc: Okay, great. I think that\u2019s all I have. Thank you very much. Patrick J. Sullivan : Safe travel, Bill. William J. Plovanic \u2013 Canaccord Genuity, Inc: Thanks. Operator :  Our next question comes from the line of Mark [indiscernible] from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is actually Robbie [Marcus] in for Mike. You know maybe just turning towards the model, Brian do you mind quantifying exactly what the impact for UNH was this quarter and what you have for next quarter? You spoke for 3 million in 3Q and 4 to 5 million in 4Q is that still the assumption baked into the guidance? Brian Roberts : Yes, that\u2019s correct. Because again each passing quarter you have to include the reorders or the last reorders if you will for the patients that didn\u2019t start the quarter before. So yes my assumption really hasn\u2019t changed from what we talked about back last quarter whether which was those about a million and a half of it impacting Q2 probably somewhere in the 3 to 3.5 million range in Q3 and then probably 4 5 or so in Q4 is we start to see the new patient start kind of pipeline ramp up again. Unidentified Analyst : Great. And then just coming back to the new patient growth you had mentioned 5% to 10% sequential growth. You\u2019d said 20% last quarter so is that so implied 25% to 30% this quarter? Brian Roberts : No different metrics, right. So 5% to 10% sequential growth Q2 to Q3 when we talked about 20% we are talking year-over-year, right. And the year-over-year we talked about that full kind of nine month period, so on a year-to-date basis which is that so, just to make sure we don\u2019t mix and add there. Unidentified Analyst : All right, since last quarter and much of the numbers are way off we had about 6000 for 100 patients, so would that imply about 6,500 this quarter, is that the right ball park? Brian Roberts : I mean I don\u2019t want to comment about actual patient count numbers, I\u2019ll just leave it to say that we\u2019re about 5% to 10% higher sequentially in Q3 than we were in Q2. I don\u2019t have all the models in front of me. Unidentified Analyst :  And then maybe just one more. Looking at the drug delivery opportunity how should we think about that unfolding over the next few years are you targeting more existing products that could get into commercialization fairly quickly or is this something that you are looking more to mix of commercialization and generic drugs plus also drugs in trials, so how should we think about this impacting revenues over the next lets say three plus years? Patrick J. Sullivan : I think conceptually we are looking at the market place and basically looking at the drugs that are currently on the market and the opportunity for using the OmniPod as a special drug delivery device for those products whether they are currently on the market or in development, in stack ranking those in terms of opportunity and near term sales growth that we could expect from those type of applications and then putting resources against those opportunities to really capitalize on this use of the OmniPod. I mean, I think from \u2013 you can leverage two things. You can leverage the technology which this obviously does and focusing on new sales and marketing to leverage the sales force. So we\u2019re going to definitely making plans to leverage this technology. Brian Roberts : Its interesting when you think about like one of the benefits of the product when you think about existing drugs is looking at when certain compounds or things come off a patent for example could be an interesting way, the interesting reason why adding in a delivery device like the OmniPod makes sense. And we keep in mind that, that with a lot of these and even with the Amgen product we\u2019ve seen it, it takes a few years once from when you sign a deal its ultimately be able to get it to market, because of the process of either maybe a little bit of development, maybe not but then ultimately going through the obviously the FDA process. So Capricor is on the other side that which is \u2013 there is the phase 2 product and we are helping them through their clinical trials. Now the reality of when that becomes a commercial product years down the line, but its exciting to be part of that one too and really affect to be part of their filing. So there\u2019s a mix of them in the pipeline, Ferring is obviously an approved one in Europe and we have been generating revenue from it. Amgen will be next and then as we continue to add more and more of these projects and we have a couple more on going, we\u2019ll see how those develop and above and be able to drive actual timelines for each one. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. And if I could just sneak in one last one. How many territory managers did you end the quarter with? Brian Roberts : Just we have about 135 people or so in the field. Right now I think we are still split at 53 territories, right. So that would basically \u2013 so 53 I guess is the answer to your question. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. Best of luck Brian. Brian Roberts : Thank you. Operator :  Our next question comes from the line of [Tow] Levi from Westbush. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good afternoon. Patrick J. Sullivan : Hey [Tow]. Unidentified Analyst : So maybe we could start with the new patient additions. Again, your comments, they definitely seem a little bit different than kind of the comments last quarter where \u2013 expectations were around 20% mutation growth and it doesn\u2019t sound like you gave sort of a new number. Yes, the revenue guidance is coming down, I guess what I\u2019m trying to get at is the \u2013 there was a backlog of patients related to UNH, there is an expectation that most of those start to flow in here in the fourth quarter and even though they may not be big on the revenue side, they are going to be noticeable on the new patient additions? Brian Roberts : Apologize, I\u2019m not sure I completely follow that, but we\u2019re \u2013 again, where we\u2019re heading just and so we stay clear here is on a year-over-year basis we\u2019ve talked that we\u2019re looking effectively for 20% year-over-year patient growth, new patients starts and I think everything has been trending close to that number. We\u2019re probably little lower than that at the moment, but again if you look at specific issue around the payer that\u2019s been one that\u2019s been driving it. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, Q2 to Q3, I mentioned a couple of minutes ago that we\u2019re basically driving between kind of 5% and 10% sequential growth. So those are the two pieces. In regards to the payer issue specifically its an open question, right, because what you seeing with the patients are in some cases they may \u2013 if there a chronologist is been saying, look you need to give on pump and unfortunately we can\u2019t get this when approved right now, but you got to get another pump, some of those patients may have gone elsewhere. Some may delay their decision. Some wait for the next trip back to the doctor. So, there\u2019s \u2013our team has done a really good job I think in the commercial side of trying to keep the patients \u2013 the pipeline warm if you will and trying to be able to bring these folks openly across the goal line. No one that were able to get this result, but ultimately we have to see how that plays itself out. So, from that perspective I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any difference. I think when you look at the revenue growth in the business, again, we\u2019ve always been a midpoint company and when we updated guidance last quarter, the midpoint of that range is 295. If you look at the midpoint of the range that we gave you today is 295. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any real change or difference there at all. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. So the backlog of patients that I know you guys talked about last quarter has been sort of like one of the biggest in company\u2019s history, that hasn\u2019t necessary changed or is this patients gone away, that\u2019s kind of what I was trying to reconcile? Brian Roberts : I mean, that\u2019s overall pipeline, right, so we\u2019re not talking about just one pair here. We\u2019re talking about the overall pipeline and that is absolutely not changed. I mean, the team is continues to do a good job of drive-in referrals and ultimately those referrals turning into new patients starts. So, I think we\u2019ve seen good momentum in that business overall. My only comment specifically to this one pair is its unclear for patient who is looking start on OmniPod back in May is going to still be there for us to be able to convert in January. I mean, we\u2019re certainly try, right, but it\u2019s a little less clear to be to say everybody is willing to wait six, seven, eight months or whatever it is to be able to finally cross the goal line. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thanks. And just one final question, Welcome Patrick, and as you talk about investing more sort of sales and marketing. In this quarter you excluding the one-time charges you get to breakeven, Q4 generally the strongest quarter of the year to assume that\u2019s going to be positive net income there, we saw on adjusted basis. As you move into 2015, where does profitability on the bottom-line sort of fit in your next call it 12 to 18 month thinking as you try to maximize top-line growth while obviously spending appropriately? Patrick Sullivan : I think the last point is the key one spending appropriately. We\u2019re going through that process as we speak to develop our 2015 budgeting in our sales plan. But I guess it\u2019s premature at this point to try to peak into the future and give the results of what we\u2019re just literally in the process of doing. So, I have more information for that earlier next year. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. Please proceed with your questions. Mike Rich \u2013 Raymond James : Hi. This is Mike Rich calling for Jayson. Can you hear me, okay? Brian Roberts : How are you? Mike Rich \u2013 Raymond James : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Most of my questions have been answered. But I just wanted to circle back to a couple of things. First, good color on the partnership with Ypsomed outside of the U.S. I know you\u2019re tracking for doubling growth this year, but can you comment on the sales growth outside the U.S. in the quarter or perhaps what percent of sales, international sales were? Brian Roberts : Not at this point I guess, but as Ypsomed said last week, I mean, they\u2019ve seen over their last six months about a 60% or so increase in their business. We\u2019re absolutely on track when we look at our international partnerships which will also include GlaxoSmithKline for Canada, to double our international revenue in 2014 versus 2013. And as Pat in his remarks, I think we\u2019re really excited and hopeful that we\u2019re going to see reimbursement in France very soon, and France is a really interesting market in Europe. I think it\u2019s the second largest pump market in Europe, and today we sit with the zero there. So, getting France over the goal line would allow really another really good growth opportunity Ypsomed as they turn the corner into calendar year 2015. But overall, I think the international business has been doing great again. One thing you can point a little \u2013 the revenue share is great. There are certainly helping us to drive to net breakeven at the operating level or an operating profit. Its lowers the gross margins slightly, but that\u2019s a good trade off. Mike Rich \u2013 Raymond James : Got it. Okay. And then is there timeline for OmniPod approval in China? Brian Roberts : Not anything at this point. I mean, I would tell you that we\u2019ve continued to kind of work through the regulatory process over there in China. I don\u2019t have an update on it. I know that we\u2019re still need [Ethernet] but it\u2019s probably some while the company\u2019s feeling we get. Mike Rich \u2013 Raymond James : Okay. And then lastly sorry, I missed this, but an update on the currently generation like PDM with LifeScan meter? Brian Roberts : Yes. We\u2019re looking to hopefully have approval that. Very soon we\u2019ve responded to all of the FDA\u2019s questions. Most of the questions that the agency came back with actually were more I would say a LifeScan driven and Insulet driven and we\u2019ll see some questions around the various strip and those pieces which our partner has done a great job of responding to and providing the data for. So, we\u2019re just in the waiting game at the moment. But hopefully we\u2019ll have an answer pretty soon. Mike Rich \u2013 Raymond James : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line Jan Wald from Benchmark Company. Please proceed with your question. Jan Wald - Benchmark Company : Thank you. And congratulations to Allison, Brian and Pat welcome and good luck. I guess most of my questions has been answered, but let me just ask a couple of more. Maybe taking also on [Dave] question a little bit more on profitability versus investment. Not looking for what\u2019s you\u2019re going to do, but how do say company moving forward. You company at your stage looks towards profitability but it needs to make investments. How do you see the priority of those two things occurring over the next year to two years? Patrick Sullivan : I think you have to strike a balance between the two. I mean, I think you have to really focus on yourselves, but you also obviously have to focus on bringing numbers at the bottom line. And we\u2019re looking at plans to be able to meet those objectives. Brian Roberts : One of the nice things Jan, we\u2019ve able to find a good balance to both of those in the past, as you could see from the fact that we\u2019ve been able to balance I think a very strong overall top line growth with getting now operating profitability, $4 million of operating profit excluding up the transition costs is are highest level of operating profit and obviously we continue to feel very bullish about pushing more gross margin to the business. So, I think the business has positioned well to be able to find balance for both those going forward, which is a good spot for the company to be. Jan Wald - Benchmark Company : Okay. I guess my next question is in your prepared remarks you mentioned there are more efficiencies that you\u2019re going to look for. I think you probably meant to manufacturing? What kinds of things would you be looking to do in manufacturing with us, I guess elsewhere in the business can might improve those \u2013 might lead to more efficiencies? Brian Roberts : Specifically when we talked about, we have the fourth manufacturing line come up and one of the thing that been interesting in our manufacturing processes, with each line we\u2019re obviously getting smarter of how to make an OmniPod with highest level of quality and most cost effectively possible. And so I think I\u2019ve shared in the past that when you look at Line 3 for example, right now its been our efficient line and we\u2019ve been able to make some small adjustments for like Line 2 for example to make it look Line 3, so that one becomes the lot more efficient. Line 1 for us is probably been \u2013 always been our most inefficient line where its highest level of people required and with the lowest capacity. So when Line 4 comes on board for example, its going to mere image Line 3, so we\u2019ll get that efficiency out of the gate and it starts to give us some flexibility to think about how we can better leverage Line 1 for example and therefore spread out overhead cost and look at the amount of direct labor required and those type of things hopefully further bring down the pod price. That plus as we keep moving up the volume spectrum, we\u2019re able to drive some additional cost components increases from our suppliers, which is also another positive and helping us generate more gross margin. So, those are couple of examples that where more efficiency can be gain. Jan Wald - Benchmark Company : Okay. And my last question, on the CGM center, it sounds as if you\u2019re still going through some kind of design process, because you\u2019re addressing the kinds of issues that would get addressed in design. Any sense of when you\u2019re going to be \u2013 when it will design for use or some like can you be able move into the clinical? Brian Roberts : I think we\u2019ve said, that we said, we\u2019ve been going to a process obviously the sterilization we\u2019ve gone through this latest testing we did was earlier on this idea of distance between sensing and dispensing and we think \u2013 we got some \u2013 we believe some pretty favorable results out of that. So you\u2019re right, that is still kind of a design phase if you will. And we\u2019ve talked about doing some inhuman trial work hopefully sometime early to mid 2015. Ultimately we\u2019ll see where that timeline is driving towards in the second kind of all the [indiscernible] next real indicator to drive the overall timeline of the project. So as we get closer to that point, that probably the next checking time. Jan Wald - Benchmark Company : Okay. Thank you very much and congratulations on the quarter. Brian Roberts : Thank you. Operator : Okay. This concludes today\u2019s Q&A session. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Mr. Sullivan for closing remarks. Patrick Sullivan : Thank you very much, operator. In summary, Insulet has achieved much in the first nine months of 2014 and I am very excited for the opportunities that line before us. With the payer issue basically behind us new commercial resources gaining valuable experience and continued international expansion; I believe we\u2019re probably for tremendous success. Our manufacturing partnership with Flextronics is world-class as we continuously produced 1 million OmniPod per month with our fourth manufacturing line coming online soon. We have the most unique user friendly product in the market with a continued pipeline of innovation that should continually raise the bar. I\u2019m delighted that Allison and Brad Thomas our new EVP of HR to the senior leadership team of the company. Our workforce with Brad has build the [Cytyc] organization for future growth prior to the acquisition by Hologic. And finally, I\u2019d also like to thank Brian for his dedication and hard work over the past six years and wish him well. Thanks again for joining us today. I look forward to meeting many of you at the various Investor conferences over the coming months and keeping you updated you on our progress. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for attending today\u2019s conference. This does conclude today\u2019s program. You may all disconnect and have a wonderful evening.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will have a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Deborah Gordon, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please go ahead. Deborah Gordon : Thank you, Nick [ph]. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2014 earnings call. My name is Deborah Gordon and joining me on the call today are Patrick Sullivan, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Allison Dorval, Chief Financial Officer. A replay of this call will be archived on our website. Our press release discussing our fourth quarter results and first quarter and full year 2015 guidance, as well as a document that provides historical data on our quarterly revenue composition are also available in the IR section of our website. Before we begin I would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may forward-looking and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to be materially different from any future results implied by such statements. Such factors include those reference and our Safe Harbor statement in our fourth quarter earnings release and the company's filings with the SEC. With that let me turn the call over Pat. Patrick Sullivan : Thanks, Deb and good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. During my remarks, I'll cover our fourth quarter and full year financial and operational highlights to specific actions that I've taken since joining the company and our strategy to drive sustained growth and shareholder value. I'll then turn the call over to Alison for further highlights on our financial performance. Let me start by saying that when I joined Insulet in September I was very enthusiastic about the opportunities for the company. Now, over five months later, I can tell you that I have even more enthusiasm and higher expectations for the results that this company can deliver. With our OmniPod system we are the market leader in tubeless insulin delivery and we believe our unique core technology will serve as the foundation for our leadership and intelligent drug delivery. Clearly we have more to do but we believe OmniPod is the most innovative and differentiated instrument than other drug delivery system on the markets. We are executing a strategy to ensure it remains well positioned or continue those option in the US and international markets. Let me start with our financial results. In the fourth quarter we achieved revenue of $72.6 million, a 6% increase compared with $68.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. We ended the year with total revenues of $288.7 million, an increase of 17% over 2013. I'd like to now provide you a further breakdown of our 2014 revenue. Revenues of our US OmniPod franchise were $173.4 million, defined as total US revenue excluding drug delivery and neighborhood diabetes. Revenues in drug delivery were $5.4 million, defined as cells or products and engineering serves to our pharmaceutical partners. Neighborhood Diabetes Revenue of $59.7 million, and included in this number is approximately 5% OmniPod revenue of neighborhood diabetes shipments of OmniPod for their patients. International OmniPod revenue of $50.2 million, this is the finest revenue to all of our international distributors including Ypsomed, GSK Canada and Group [ph]. We are providing this additional detail in order to give you additional insight into our business. We're committed to consistently reporting these metrics and will therefore provide you with the same components at the end of 2015. As we believe they are the most important drivers for the performance of the business. I think it's also important to point out that I have a senior executive who is completely accountable with the performance of each of these business areas. In addition to our commentary here today, we've also posted a document on our IR website that provides 2014 and 2013 quarterly revenues for each of these areas of our business. During the course of this year, we will also evaluate additional metrics that we should provide to you to provide insight into our operational and financial progress. Now turning back to our operational performance, our patient base continues to grow. As of the end of 2014 there are approximately 75,000 worldwide using OmniPod with approximately 75% in the United States. In the fourth quarter, approximately 70% of our new patient starts came from people who previously used multiple daily injections and we saw a 10% increase in new patient\u2019s starts of children under the age of ten compared to the fourth quarter of last year. In 2014 our installed base of US OmniPod users grew sequentially every quarter in 2014 resulting in an almost 20% increase in our existing patient base in the US. Moreover, we expect a 20% year-over-year growth in new patient starts in the second half of 2015. We believe this growth will be driven by increased productivity of our existing sales force and the initial impact of the additions we're making this year. In addition, we anticipate further growth as a result of our peer-to-peer speakers program that started this month. We are well positioned to deliver even stronger performance including enhanced overall top line growth. I like to take the opportunity to make just several comments regarding the new patient start metric. First of all, in any given quarter only about 10% of our US OmniPod revenue is from new patient starts. As a new management team we are focusing not only adding new patients but capitalizing on the opportunity we see of increased OmniPod utilization that our existing customer base represents. While the majority of our customers order four times per year, we see an opportunity to focus on re-orders and increased utilization where 90% of our US OmniPod revenues come from. I'd now like to review a few of the actions that I've taken since joining Insulet five months ago. We completely restructured the US commercial team in addition to proven leaders across the Board including a new Chief Commercial Officer, Anhert Trup [ph]; three new Vice President of Sales, Marketing and Managed Care. All are experienced leaders with consistent records of outstanding performance with whom I have worked with in the past with great success. We've also expanded the sales force, augmenting the expansion that occurred during 2014 and due to our confidence in new commercial leadership we are further expanding the sales during the first half of 2015. We are also making a significant in Key Opinion Leader development but subsequent application of widespread medical education efforts. This is a proven initiative in marketing to healthcare providers. We are undertaking new initiatives of managed care marketing under the leadership of a proven managed care executive who is building a world class team with new focus on sustaining existing reimbursement and expanding better coverage, including Medicare and Medicaid coverage. We've also increased our focus on market segmentation and sales force targeting, including a renewed focus on the pediatric segment and laser focus on existing prescribers that have significant opportunity to expand their current use of the OmniPod system. We've made a significant upgrade to our customer service and support function with new experienced leadership which will provide a much improved ability to move newly prescribed patients due to the intake and reimbursement or vacation process by increasing our focus on customer retention and our re-order wait. We brought on two senior executives to focus on the significant opportunity we see in our drug delivery business. And finally, I've hired two senior executives to focus on our neighborhood diabetes business and our international OmniPod opportunities. These changes have been made and as a result we expect to see market really improved performance, in the US OmniPod business beginning in Q3 2015. We are confident that this routine will increase its option of our unique system and we anticipate returning the double digit growth in the US during the second half of 2015 and accelerating growth going forward. I have challenged each of these new executives to drive focus, growth, and increased accountability throughout the entire organization. These executives bring a history of executional excellence, as well the experience of working together as a team and I'm confident this leadership team will take Insulet to the next level. After national sales meeting in January, we outlined many of these initiatives. There is palpable energy from the sales team who are energized by our new focus and additional materials and additional support they will received in 2015. Along with the additions to our field sales team and other key factors in our success will be to enhance our marketing efforts. We've been focused on increasing patient that wears OmniPod system and increasingly healthcare professionals and managed care plans understanding our products unique benefits. That is why we are on the process of further analyzing patient out information, identifying key clinical source, daily resources to improve our marketing materials and drive adoption. We're also engaged in refining our market segmentation. We know that 15% of our new starts in 2014 were under the age of 10; over 35% were under the age of twenty. We've aligned the marketing organizations to focus on the pediatric segment. In fact we had nice success from his segment were limited marketing focus and therefore we strongly believe we can accelerating growth in this area. We will continue to drive marketing initiatives through a specific customer segment. We need to connect this with a patient of a parent of a child differently with pipeline diabetes in a very different want then we do the 35 year old who has managed diabetes using multiple daily injections. Our marketing team is fully committed to finding the exact message why resonates and giving our sales team the resources they need. These market segmentation initiatives are very important to our future with customer adoption and retention. I'm also very excited about our international business. As you know Ypsomed is the key partner for us in Europe and we are very pleased with their performance. They continue to drive new patient adoption of OmniPod with approximately 70% growth in the installed base in 2014. We believe based on the 2014 run rate they will continue to increase their installed base by over 40% in 2015. I'd like to now address some of the recent questions that many of you have had related to our sales to Ypsomed. As a background, we entered into our relationship with Ypsomed in June of 2010 with an initial contract exploration of 2016. Under the terms of the agreement if Ypsomed meet certain purchase volumes in 2013 and 2014 the contract would automatically be extended in additional 12 months. They meet the requirements in both years and as a result the contract has been extended through the middle of 2018. Ypsomed launched the OmniPod into the European market in the middle of 2013, slightly ahead of the United States. And as you are aware Ypsomed had challenges in supplying the market in both, the US and internationally during 2013. As a result Ypsomed brought inventory in advance to support their market expansion and we were shipping behind their request. In fact, we shipped about $4 million Q4 2013 order in Q1 of 2014, and throughout most of 2014 Ypsomed increased their safety stock of inventory as a hedge against our production challenges. Now that Ypsomed is confident in our ability to reliably and consistently produce OmniPod, they\u2019ve decided to reduce their safety stock in Q1 2015. It's important to note here that we do anticipate product shipments to Ypsomed this quarter and our international revenues return to a more normalized quarterly trend beginning in the second quarter of 2015 and forward. We now have visibility of Ypsomed\u2019s new patient starts and re-order rates and feel comfortable this trend will continue beyond 2015, and a fact should we turn to year-over-year growth in 2016. We've recently hired an executive whose main job is to work with Ypsomed on building out the international markets and driving growth. As you've seen in our press release this morning, we are also excited about going direct in Canada. As many of you know we've been working with GSK as our distribution partner since 2011 and we've just announced we decided to take this business direct. We will assume the distribution sales and marketing of OmniPod in Canada, and we're working with closely with GSK on a transition plan to go direct this summer. This is a meaningfully step as we look to drive top line growth and establish OmniPod as the worldwide standard of care and go to our offerings internationally. In addition to our sales and marketing effort, our operations team have also been driving hard. Our best-in-class manufacturing capabilities are a key barrier for anyone trying to compete in the past pump space. Just last month we qualified our fourth manufacturing line of Flextronics and near 50,000 pods produced in one day. The team has done a tremendous job in giving the line up and running, making sure that our quality remains at the highest levels. We are at this point where we have sufficient manufacturing capacity in place, and aligned for [ph] gives us even more confidence. Turning to R&D, we are also working on a number of development projects within our diabetes business. In order to maintain continued success we just continue to innovative, making progress under development of our new personal diabetes manager with a goal of filing for 510(K) clearance at the end of the year. This new handheld will have more modern user interface with a touchscreen technology and a corporate booth to low end energy capabilities. We see this as one of the most important announcements as it will allow us two way communication with other platforms such as Dexcom\u2019s shared platform. Earlier this month we've announced that we've renewed our partnership with Abbott Diabetes Care and the blood processing will be incorporated into our new PDM. We're very excited about these partnerships as we move into 2015. As you know, we are also working closely with Eli Lily on the ionic broad system, the way you use himulin, use 500 insulin, this product continues to track and the clinical trial expected to start by this year. Outside the Diabetes space I'm incredibly excited our opportunity to use our technology to deliver other drugs. There has been a shot from pharmaceuticals to biologic in the drugs delivery space. My challenge is to come with a delivery - occurred a very interesting opportunities. Current delivering methods of typically auto injections, injectors and syringes, but the only part is significantly changing that. Our part introduces intelligent drug delivery with capabilities and monitoring compliance. It will also allow for varying dosing and alarm sensing [ph]. We believe OmniPod is very well positioned to increase the ease of the use and treatment compliance for a variety of relevant resulting in improvement outcomes. In 2015 we plan to add resources to support OmniPod\u2019s anticipated growth outside of diabetes. Since our first commercial non-insulin product loss in 2011 referring we partner with a number of other companies. And in January Amgen announced that they received FDA approval for their new on-body deliver system. Injector for this systems uses our OmniPod with some customization for the actual deliver. Under our agreement, we now sell products to Amgen which are packaged in the new kit [ph]. We also have number of other drug delivery partnerships in various stages and we're very excited about that opportunity. With those remarks, I'd now like to turn the call over to Allison for financial summary. Alison? Allison Dorval : Thank you, Pat. Unless otherwise stated, all of my commentary regarding changes will be on a year-over-year basis. Pat already provided the revenue growth rate as there is added color, international OmniPod revenue represented 18% of our Q4 2014 revenue company's to 14% in Q3 3023. For the full year international OmniPod revenue represented 17% versus 10% in 2013. As Pat mentioned, our international partners continue to drive growth in 2014 and our international OmniPod revenues doubled. Consolidation gross profit increased 11% in the fourth quarter to $36.7 million. Gross margins were 51% reflecting approximately 60% margins on our US OmniPod business, offset by lower margins from our international OmniPod and neighborhood diabetes businesses. Gross profit for the full year of 2014 was $143.3 million, an increase of $30.9 million or 27%, and gross margins improved to 50% versus 45% last year. We continue to drive efficiencies with our manufacturing process and our focus is paid off, we experienced improved manufacturing throughout 2014 driving lowest entry [ph] cost and overall improvement in customer satisfaction. Q4 2014 operating expenses increased 19% to $38.9 million and included $3.8 million of charges related to the management team transition. There are no one-time charges in Q4 of last year. Operating expenses were $155.6 million for the full year of 2014 compared to $141.5 million in 2013. Operating expenses in 2014 including approximately $17.4 million of management transition and patent litigation settlement charges. Operating expenses in 2013 included approximately $10 million related to patent litigation settlement and next generation OmniPod launch cost. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $5.4 million or $0.10 per share compared to $2.5 million or $0.04 per share in the prior year. The 2014 full year net loss was $51.5 million or $0.93 per share compared to $45.0 million or $0.83 per share in 2013. The main difference between our full year 2014 net loss and our $12.3 million operating loss was the $39.1 million of net interest expense which included the loss on extinguishment of our 3.75% convertible notes in addition to interest on our outstanding 2% convertible notes. Our cash balance was $151.2 million at the end of 2014 compared to $149.7 million at the end of 2013, and we had approximately 56.3 million shares outstanding. Turning to guidance, we expect full year 2015 revenue to be in the range of $305 million to $320 million representing a year-over-year increase of 6% to 11%. The majority of the growth is expected in the back half of the year as we gain traction from the new team and commercial initiative. We expect to see growth primarily within our US OmniPod business resulting from the renewed focus of the commercial team. We also expect to see solid growth within our drug delivery business, in fact we've previously stated that we anticipate $10 million to $20 million of revenue from this business and we now expect this range to be $15 million to $20 million. Lastly, 2015 revenue from both our international OmniPod and neighborhood diabetes businesses are expected to remain relatively consistent with prior year level. For the first quarter of 2015 we expect revenues of $67 million to $69 million, driven by a reduction of inventory levels by our international partners. This reduction will be partially offset by the expected increase in revenue from our drug delivery business. With that operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we have a question from the line of Danielle Antalffy with Leerink Partners. Your line is now open, please proceed with your question. Danielle Antalffy : Thanks so much guys for taking the question, good afternoon. Patrick, I was hoping you can give a little bit of color on the dynamics of the current market, so obviously the US OmniPod business has historically been significantly lower, it sounds like you're saying that was due to poor execution, correct me if I'm wrong. And - so how do we think about the current market dynamics going forward? Is there anything specific to OmniPod beyond poor execution, you touched on it, but what are you doing to reintegrate growth in that business? And what do you see as a sustainable growth rate, maybe you confirm with us what market share OmniPod has in the US insulin pump market because based on the installed base that we're hearing about stay, it might be much lower than what we had thought. Patrick Sullivan : I would start off by saying that the opportunity that I see to expand our OmniPod businesses is significant, we're only about 5% of the current type I diabetes patients and I think there is tremendous opportunity based upon the characteristics of the OmniPod system to significantly increase that. And I think with the appropriate focus on managing - marketing to the healthcare providers, as well as targeted marketing to the insurance companies we can knock down the obstacles that currently exist in getting OmniPod more widely adopted in the marketplace. I think fundamentally I've talked about this a lot that we fundamentally need to show the clinical benefit and the economic benefit to both, the doctors and the patients to provide widespread adoption for the product, we're focused on doing that with mining data sources that we have at the performance of the product in the field, as well as taking that information to the insurance plans which differentiates our product and show it's benefit to those - to the healthcare marketplace. Danielle Antalffy : Okay, that's helpful. And then - so it sounds like historically the OmniPod has been more of a patient driven therapy, you know patients going to their providers and asking for the OmniPod, so it sounds like that focus is shifting, will you still focus at all on the patient or if this is now just focusing strictly on the providers and the payer. And a follow-up to that if I could, on the payer side I think, is there anything specific to OmniPod beyond UNH and if you could confirm that, the UNH issue is now completely behind as you have started getting new UNH patients, is there any reimbursement issue that we should be aware of when it comes specifically to the OmniPod? Patrick Sullivan : I think just to knock off the UNH issue, the issue that faced the company last year was paperwork issue and that issue with UNH has been resolved and we don't anticipate any further impact from that event that occurred last year. Let me frame the marketing effort, I think in order to really market any product you have to market - in our case, the three constituencies, we have to market to the healthcare providers, the doctors, in the office who prescribe the product; we have to market to the healthcare insurers who pay for the product; and finally we have to market to the patients who use the product. And in order to - we have to get all three of those moons in alignment to provide for widespread adoption. We have to market the features and benefits of our product and patients awareness for the patients know that this technology is available. We have to market the clinical and economic benefit to the doctors in the office so that they understand the benefit that this product has for their patients. And finally we have to market to the insurance carriers, the people that pay for it, the clinical and economic benefit for the people for whom they provide diabetes reimbursement, and I think it's - you have to get all those three moons in alignment to really provide the widespread adoption and I think historically the focus at Insulet has been on one moon, it's been mostly on the patients providing the tubeless technology in a convenience for the patients. And to a certain extent I think we really now need to change the focus to the healthcare providers who prescribe the product and the healthcare insurance companies that pay for it, and that hasn\u2019t been done historically. Danielle Antalffy : Okay, thank you for that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JP Morgan. Your line is now open, please proceed with your question. Mike Weinstein : Thanks guys for taking the question. So many time you clarified a couple of items. So you said that the patient base is growing [ph] - grew 20% in the aspect that revenues were up only 15%, is that right? Patrick Sullivan : Yes. Mike Weinstein : Okay. So what's the disconnect there between the patient base growing 20% or close to and revenues growing 15%? Allison Dorval : Part of it Mike is the timing that the patients are growing, so as you know we have discussed that, we added more new patients towards the back end of this year than we have it in the early part of this year. So that would account a portion of it. Mike Weinstein : I did circle on that but at this stage that shouldn't be the difference but we can come back to that one. So let's talk about international, so in my understanding that your expectation is that revenues will be roughly flat this year that's what you were saying now? Patrick Sullivan : That's correct, expect revenues too internationally to be relatively flat. Mike Weinstein : Okay. And so the destocking - it will be worked down daily to catch up with the demand relative being in forth. Do you think that takes a quarter or even that takes more than a quarter? Patrick Sullivan : We are shipping - we anticipate shipping to Ypsomed this quarter, we expect it to finish this quarter and back to normal ordering patterns - the quarterly ordering patterns in quarters two, three and four. Mike Weinstein : Okay. So international is relatively flat, neighborhood is relatively flat in taking out in comments, and given the guidance on the piece that would imply roughly 5% to 11% growth for the US OmniPod business but it sounds like just from the commentary that you expect the first quarter to be lot lower than that and the second half to be a lot higher based on acceleration in business in the back half of the year. Am I capturing that correct? Patrick Sullivan : Yes. Mike Weinstein : Okay. And then let me ask you one last question, in fact we've talked about this - the tainted landscape is external delivery as it is wrapped in that over the last 18 months, I'm really starting with the 530G launch next product which certainly from the numbers it's like - it's really slowed your meaning [ph] for insulin at that time, you've got 530G, you've had the ramp of ten and you've had now - just see in the first quarter the J&J guide launch, and everybody has got launches coming over the next few years. So it feels like it's a much more competitive environment than it was two years ago, how do you think about that and how do you think about to be able to be into those world purchase maybe important in the world two or three years ago for insulin. Thanks. Patrick Sullivan : Well, obviously there has been more competitor activity but I'll come back to the tremendous opportunity and where we are getting the majority of our relative converting the MDI patients to OmniPod and quite frankly, we have not done a great job of differentiating the product to healthcare providers, to insurance plans, and we need to increase patient awareness as well. So I think with the opportunity for us, while we do worry about competition but I think our major competition is MDI quite frankly, and that's where we need to focus. Mike Weinstein : Okay. I'll let somebody else jump in and then I'll get back in the queue. Thank you guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair. Your line is now open, please proceed with your question. Ben Andrew : Great, thank you for taking the questions. Allison can you help us a little bit with the revenue breakdown you were able to give and I really appreciate that detail, it's extremely helpful. Is there something in the neighborhood diabetes line that gets down to $60 million and beyond, kind of peer distribution, is there any Omni pattern there? I mean I was under the impression that was running more like $7 million or $8 million a quarter, so I'm just trying to understand the disconnect with where we were at. Allison Dorval : Ben, in the past commentary if you talked about 5% of that neighborhood number incorporating OmniPod revenue, that's what the neighborhood businesses is selling on behalf of OmniPod. Patrick Sullivan : And the balance of it is just routine diabetes products such as testing and supplies, from supplies CGM, CGM supply etcetera, as well as the old service pharmacy. Ben Andrew : Sure, okay. As we sit here and talk - think about kind of the canes through 2015, you talked about 20% plus revenue growth in the back half or patient growth, what do you see in the first part of this year, this is the net of the inventory stocking, so what is international and what do you think it can be kind of first and second quarters in the United States? Patrick Sullivan : I'm not sure I fully understood your question Ben. Ben Andrew : Okay, I'm just trying to understand the cadence over the course of 2015, I know Mike has just talked about this but just - the net of inventory adjustments where do you think they are in Q1 and where do you think Q1 patient heads out for insulin as we started - can it go to the transition with the new marketing programs coming out? Patrick Sullivan : I think we're going to continue to add new patients starts as we go throughout the year but the balance - more significant increase is going to be in the back half of the year as we get these marketing programs and sales force up to speed and fully productive in the field. Ben Andrew : Okay. And then Pat, as we look at the market growth of MDI switching over to pumping, our analysis suggest that last year you guys were sort of holding share in terms of your percentage if you will of your current installed base versus what you were getting out of the MDI converters. Do you think you can convert that - accelerate that or would you start taking more share with the investments and over what timeframe can that happen? Patrick Sullivan : As I had mentioned, I think - I'm thoroughly confident the team will put in together, I mean if you think about it's not only sales and marketing, managed care marketing, it's - we, the whole commercial team have confidence that we're going to be able to increase the OmniPod revenue as we move forward with initial reporting in places just to get in and starts to have an effect. Ben Andrew : Okay, alright. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bill Plovanic with Canaccord. Your line is now open, please proceed with your question. Bill Plovanic : Great, thanks, good evening. Can you hear me okay? Patrick Sullivan : Yes. Bill Plovanic : Great, thank you. So just on the GSK, as you make that transition with them mid-summer, are there going to be any take backs on that relationship? Patrick Sullivan : What's a take back? Bill Plovanic : Inventory, so you have to take back any of the inventory or is that been sold through or how should we think about that, and if so, does it hit any particular quarter? Allison Dorval : So overall the relationship has been sell in, but GSK is purchasing inventory based on their demand, I'm sure that they will have some level of inventory in their warehouse on the date that we make that transition and I think as we finalize the agreement one week over the rest in Canada, there may be some repurchase of that inventory but it shouldn't be a take back of revenue by any means. Bill Plovanic : Okay. So probably as we think about it, you have Ypsomed working inventory down in Q1, those normalize and get back on ordering in Q2 but then GSK will probably have to transition in Q2 to really it's probably Q3 feel forward international it's more normalized? Patrick Sullivan : No, I think it\u2019s Q2 is more, it's going to be more normalized and GSK is not as nearly as large component of our new international revenue, Ypsomed is. Bill Plovanic : Okay, good. And then as we think of Q1, I mean you've given guidance, how much is the bonus of the stock in for drug delivery that we should think about in Q1? Patrick Sullivan : What we would have but what we anticipate in shipping in Q4 of last year, moving into Q1, is that your question? Bill Plovanic : Yes, I think if I remember correctly, it was like $5 million or something like that? Patrick Sullivan : That's right. Bill Plovanic : Okay. And then as we think about it, one of the things you've talked about, you've added a lot of support to start focusing on the payers, the physicians, even also the patients; if you could just help us out with where does the customer focus whether it be the physician/patient focus, distribution channel, where does that end 2014 in terms of quantifying that number? And then what should we expect in 2015 and just as a base of reference, where was that in 2013? Allison Dorval : We talked about investing about $15 million or so in our commercial organization in 2015, I think that we need to get through 2015, see how the resources have come into play, make sure that they are being productive and then we'll talk about what we are planning to do in 2016 but I think at this point we're talking about 2015 and $15 million of additional spend over 2014. Bill Plovanic : I think my question - I'm sorry, maybe I wasn't clear is, how reps did you have at the end of 2013, how many do you have at the end of 2014 and where do you think 2015 will be? Patrick Sullivan : We had 135 roughly, at the end of 2014 we're going to 150. Bill Plovanic : Okay. And then I think - in your guidance you gave its revenue guidance, there wasn't anything on operating loss, how should we think about 2015 in terms of operations, in terms of gains or losses for the year or even just qualitatively relative to 2014? Thank you very much. Allison Dorval : I think as you're planning through the year I think we are anticipating getting to an operating breakeven level by Q4 of 2015. Bill Plovanic : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Betfur [ph] with Raymond James. Your line is now open, please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Good afternoon, thanks for taking the questions. In your prepared comments you mentioned an increased focus on reorders and increased utilization, and I never really saw utilization as an issue so just on the reorder rate, prior management had talked about an attrition rate of 10%, have you seen any change in that attrition rate or is that 10% number correct? Patrick Sullivan : We have not seen a change in that, the 10% number is correct. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Patrick Sullivan : I think what we're talking about increased utilization of that is all base is quite simply this, there are - although the vast majority of our patients or four times a year, there are those that don't order or less than four times a year, what we like to do is get all of our patients, order four times a year and we see that as an opportunity to increase utilization. And some of the reasons they don't order four times a year maybe that they - during the summer time or certain periods of the year they go back to MDI therapy and whatever reasons and in some cases the insurance coverage may change and they won\u2019t any longer be - this happens in fact with Medicare, if a person is on OmniPod right now and they go on Medicare, since we don't have Medicare coverage they lose that current Medicare coverage and as you know Medicare doesn't currently reimburse for the OmniPod. So we're taking actions to try to get information to our patients that there are some important things for their health is to be on OmniPod 24/7/365, and secondly taking down the bury of Medicare reimbursement for the patients that are turning 65 and going on Medicare coverage. Those are the types of utilization initiatives I'm referring to. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And just on the reimbursement, it's not like we're all kind of conditioned to think that reimbursement wasn't really an issue or hurdle to growth, it seems like you\u2019re a little bit more focused on the reimbursement, you brought on a new executive. What are the goals there, meaning, is it primary goal Medicare reimbursement? And then secondly, just to circle back on an earlier question, have there been any new issues with reimbursement that has cropped up to the last - let's say six months? Patrick Sullivan : No, I think in general as you all know pump therapy is reimbursed by insurance company. However, my point here is that insurance companies have certain requirements that patients must provide in order to have access to pump therapy or OmniPod and in some of those cases it's measurements of A1 fee [ph] over the period of time, glucose levels, other types of things that they need to do in order to be put on pump therapy. The way I think about this is, I can imagine a world where we have demonstrated the clinical and economic benefit to the insurance plans, that they would reduce those barriers to adopt to make more widely available insurance coverage for those patients, and in order to do you got to market for the insurance plans to show them your ability to change A1 fee levels for example and to provide other quality measurements that convinces them that reimbursing or having more people on pump therapy and OmniPod in particular is important for them. And so that's what I refer to when I talk about marketing to the insurance plans, it's because they make it sometimes difficult for patients to qualify or to be put on pump therapy because all of the hops they have to jump through. And secondly on Medicare coverage, we - as you know we don't have Medicare coverage and for patients over 65 that's an issue and something we're working on. Unidentified Analyst : That's helpful, I appreciate Pat. I'll get back in queue. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tail Levy with Wedbush [ph]. Your line is now open, please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thanks. So quick clarification in terms of the new patient additions, the number that's included in the neighborhood that you provided on the quarter, is that similar historically? Patrick Sullivan : Yes, I would say it's probably around the 5% range of the neighborhood\u2019s total revenues, 5% of that is OmniPod product that they are shipping to their patients or customers. Unidentified Analyst : And when you talk about new patients additions and in total patients, whether it's US - I guess, mainly in the US, you're not including - are those patients in any of - 5% of those patients included in the neighborhood? Patrick Sullivan : They are not, we don't - they would be not a big number. So we don't include those new patients, it's just to ease your poise, not to break that out at this point. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. And in terms of the drug delivery orders, I know someone asked about the inventory buildup there, any feedback thus far from that in terms of how the product is being used, ordering patterns throughout the year, are they happy to go back to design board or anything like that? Patrick Sullivan : Based on our contract with Amgen we're not committed to provide any color on what they are doing. I can tell you that as Allison talked about early in the conference call we have taken the bow drug delivered estimate for the year up from $10 million to $15 million. So perhaps that's an indication of how it's going. Unidentified Analyst : Perfect. And then just lastly, the change of - I guess the continuation of the exclusive relationship, does that have any financial changes to that relationship, do you have - is there any financer to doing that, rather than going to with J&J? Allison Dorval : Not really much different than what we were receiving under the J&J agreement - what we would have received under the J&J agreement. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Suraj Kalia [ph] with North Line Securities. Your line is now open, please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Good afternoon, everyone, thank you for taking my questions. So Patrick let me start on to your - you mentioned a bunch of factors in your prepared remarks, let me see if I can kind of tie all of them together and can get your perspective on what's going on at least from a core growth perspective. OmniPod has obviously grown like a rocket ship over the last five or six years and now the growth seems to somewhat slowing, in your opinion of the five months you've been at the helm, do you think it's more of a function of the low hanging fruit being taken, product application, reimbursement, customer services or competition? I mean, I'm just trying to put various buckets together, what you think is the key - product education is one of the things that you mentioned, should I infer from that, that other factors are having a demonimous impact per say? Patrick Sullivan : No, I think in order to provide continued and accelerated OmniPod growth we've got - as I mentioned, the aftermarket - we have more effective and targeted marketing to the healthcare providers and to the patients when we talked about focus on pediatric patient population. And I think continued demonstrating the clinical and the economic benefit to the payers. And I think as part of the product offering you always have to, in this market offer a service component that provides getting to patient from the doctor prescription onto the product and trend etcetera, and we are making some investments in our inside organization to improve the customer service experience or those patients that are not only coming on the product and ensuring that they have a very great patient experience in the first 90 days but for the existing customers, to reach out to them more frequently and communicate and really have a more comprehensive marketing program for our customers. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And Patrick, forgive me if I missed this in you guys remarks, what's the status on the CGM development program for the OmniPod and part of the reason I asked also is, you know Medtronic is launching a 640G in Europe, I'd love to get some color from you how you see any of these pseudo artificial pancreas/pumps impacting business or like they are off? Thank you for taking my questions. Patrick Sullivan : Yes, I would say our strategy is that as it relates to the artificial pancreas, we are putting together strategy so that OmniPod is a very significant part of the artificial pancreas product offering in the future. And with that you need to have a CGM product offering, as well as an offering to put the three units together if you will, and as you know we have been working internally on our own CGM development which continues but also we have an agreement with - already have an agreement with Dexcom to use their CGM sensor along with our new PDM to integrate that those two products together, and I think with that combination used in algorithm and we're looking at opportunities to have an algorithm that we could then provide the full package. I'd also say that we would evaluate and look at opportunities with Abbott and others that would have potential CGM integration opportunities for us. So in the short term we're looking at other people that have CGM capabilities and algorithm capability, but at the same time we are continuing at a low level our own efforts in our own CGM product development. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jarred Logo [ph] with Newbird Securities. Your line is now open, please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you very much and good afternoon. I'm pleased to say I'm not only a financial professional, I'm an end user. And first to address customer service, I've been extremely pleased with the level of support from the trainings I had with my local reps to the staff that I have defective pod, they\u2019ve been very prompt and courteous. I would say I'm one of your most active cheerleaders down in South Florida since I learned the pod from my young daughter, I probably told a hundred people about it, shown them and to a person they\u2019ve all been very amazed. My endocrinologist last visit he had four or five different brochures from other products and despite my enthusiasm and my continued success with the OmniPod I haven't seen any brochures in his waiting room. So I'd like to propose the following because I believe your end users, your consumers are the best marketers. I suggest having a coupon offer that you do a direct mail to all your consumers with a return envelope, and simply if they would include their endocrinologist business card, send it back into the company, they receive a $10 credit against their next order and you receive thousands of leads from professionals across the country. That's what I wanted to suggest, I am building my client base with the stock, I'm an end user that goes a long way. But again the marketing has to be ramped up because everyone has shown are impressed and I think this could have driven some retail sales because again, I think your consumers are your best marketers. Thank you. Patrick Sullivan : Well, first of all I'd like to thank you for your very complimentary remarks concerning the customer service. Our organization and your interaction within to it, as it relates to our OmniPod business, and then I'd also like to say we want to make that customer service experience even better for you, thank you. Secondly, I think you make a very good point where reference selling or having people that are currently on the product, refer it to their friends and physicians is a very important part of the overall strategy that we're developing through to get all three of the moons in alignment; the doctors, the patients, and the payers, so that we have broader adoption of the marketplace that more physicians are prescribing it and more healthcare/insurance companies are paying for it. So I think you were spot on, I'm going to pass that directly onto our marketing for its consideration and thank you for the great idea. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jan Wald with Benchmark. Your line is now open, please proceed with your question. Jan Wald : I guess I have a couple of questions. Your commercialization effort is something that I just said is very important, you're going to focus on going forward. Two components of that, that you mentioned over, the clinical studies, the economic studies and the - I was just wondering if you could go into little bit more detail then towards the topline information you provided, how are you going to go about that, what kind of study should we expect, are they ongoing, when should we see presentations of those studies to help the providers make the kind of decisions you want them to make? Patrick Sullivan : I think as it relates to clinical evidence I would use the term and in my remarks I didn't talk about new clinical studies, what I'm referring to is actually clinical data that's already available. There are many places throughout the country that we have a large base of OmniPod users and hopefully we're working to try to find a way to mind that database to show the clinical evidence of - for example, A1C levels on a person that was on MDI not going to OmniPod. So I think there is a fair bit of clinical data already out there that we simply need to mind, but as we go down the road it's getting more clinical trials and clinical evidence, we may need to look at - and incorporate doing some clinical trial work but that's not contemplated at this point, additional work is not contemplating at this point in time. And yes that is same information also it will be helpful with working for providers to serve the benefits of this - of the OmniPod as it relates to the performance for their patients. Jan Wald : So right now you think the retrospective analysis are going to be good [ph]? Patrick Sullivan : I think - well, let me tell you where we are today, we have data on 59 patients that shows 0.59% reduction to me when sea levels. We have data in the field and available I think that we can mind - initial data shows that 1.1 reduction in A1C on little over a thousand patients. So that data is available - we'll get a statistical analysis and hope to use that in marketing to doctors and payers. The other thing I would mention is that, insurance plans are often evaluated by their customers, by big large employers on quality measurements related to the - measurements and those are quality measures that are used to - basically a report card for insurance plans and they specifically heated measures related to A1C levels and other measurements of diabetes care, and I think that's another avenue where if you can show an insurance plan that you can improve their A1C compliance, their A1C numbers, that's meaningful for them as they market to the large employers throughout the country. That's the kind of value proposition we need to bring to insurance companies that here before hasn\u2019t been done. Jan Wald : Okay. Now just - again on commercialization effort, the - benefits, it is easy to list sort of the topline - what are the ones that you really are going to try to detail and go towards the pairs in the docs worth? Patrick Sullivan : I think it's the - as you think of the benefits of the product, I mean there are many from product features that tubeless delivery among others, but I think the clinical benefit is that what are the A1C levels of individuals on MDI therapy before they go on the OmniPod and what are they have been on the OmniPod for a while, the data when you see consistently shows a reduction in A1C levels that are in our view significant. So I think that's the principal one is also in the data we've mined so far - 15 unit per day reduction in insulin usage. So I think there is a number of different metrics we can mind that's going to give us a dataset we can take the doctors and to payers. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sean Rodrigues with Cohen & Company. Your line is now open, please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good afternoon, thanks for taking the question. So first trying to put some of your commentary back in the context of your guidance assumptions, so on the commercial organization you've made some leadership changes expanding the headcount and then trying to really drive some cultural changes to the organization but are you assuming you will see things like productivity increases or that the new reps become meaningfully productive this year or what you're doing in the guidance assumption that's not necessarily linked that way? Patrick Sullivan : We are definitely assuming improved representative productivity sales force effectiveness in the field. The team that I put together on the whole commercial side under our Chief Commercial Officer is - have all worked together, know how to drive sales forces, how to design sales forces, and to relate and try top line growth. So - absolutely we've got improvements in sales force productivity baked into our assumptions. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And that includes the new hires that you will be making and obviously the time it will take for them to get up and running in productive? Patrick Sullivan : That's correct. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then I'm trying to understand the US OmniPod dynamics the past year or so in the context of the comp dynamics that you're facing in 2015, so you talked about the capacity improvements, how much do you think that capacity was the limiter of US growth last year given the international growth and the Ypsomed stocking that you talked about or do you not consider this as a significant factor in the past year performance? Allison Dorval : No I don't think capacity was a big driver of 2014, I think in Q1 and Q2 we were able to bring our manufacturing lines back up to the levels that we needed them to be producing it, so I don't think it was the capacity. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, helpful. Thank you. Patrick Sullivan : Operator, we'll take one more question if there is any available. Operator : Our next question in the queue comes from the line of Steven Eichmann [ph] with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open, please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you, hi guys. Just a follow-up on the expense side of the equation, where should we be thinking about gross margin in 2015 and where do you see that going over the medium to long term? Allison Dorval : I think for gross margin we talked about in the call that our US OmniPod sales are just over 60% gross margins, I think what you will see in 2015 is that any improvement in gross margin will largely be driven by mix, and we did mention that our international business as well as our neighborhood diabetes businesses are at lower gross margins, so as you bring in more US OmniPod sales, as you bring in more drug delivery, you will see some improvement in that gross margin level. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then Allison on the fourth quarter, the profitability point you made is that on a GAAP basis or non-GAAP basis, or cash basis? Allison Dorval : Operating profit. Unidentified Analyst : On a GAAP basis, okay. On the Lily type II process, when do you anticipate that trial starting, and any early sense of what that trial will look like? Patrick Sullivan : We expect the trial to begin this year and we have worked with delay on the protocol, both, what they are going to do, what we're going to do, and FDA has basically given us green light; it will start later this year, probably won\u2019t be commercial until 2017. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then in terms of the destocking side of Ypsomed, what level are you expecting in the first quarter, what is - approximately what's build into that guidance and what was it in the fourth quarter, I know that impacted you somewhat in the fourth quarter? Allison Dorval : We haven't spoken out exactly how much was related to the international market, and unlike Pat said earlier, if that is ordering product again here in Q1, so we see the order volume getting back to where it should be and we expect by Q2 that will - that destocking will all be done. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. But in terms of the level of decline from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, even though you're going to have the Amgen revenue, is that, that level of decline principally because of this destocking or how should we be thinking about that versus what you would breakout or think about in the US? Allison Dorval : The Q4 to Q1 decline was being primarily related to the destocking. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, alright. Thank you. Operator : There no further questions. I would like to turn the call over to Patrick for closing remarks. Patrick Sullivan : Thank you very much. First of all I want to reiterate how excited I am to be at Insulet and how strongly I believe there are so many untapped opportunities before us. Our new senior leadership team is very well positioned to capitalize and provide improved commercial execution over a strong platform with our OmniPod system that will not only allow us to drive featured options with the right operating strategy in place, that will provide us with the unique and incredible opportunity to drive growth within the drug delivery business. I'm confident we are driving forward on the right strategy to position Insulet on long term accelerated growth and create shareholder value. I look forward to meeting many of you at Investor conferences over the coming months and keeping you updated on our progress on future calls, as well as providing you additional details about our execution, strategy and future vision. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. And you may all disconnect. Have a good day everyone.",

Operator : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Insulet Corporation's First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Deborah R. Gordon - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Communications : Thank you, Damian. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for our First Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Patrick Sullivan, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Allison Dorval, Chief Financial Officer; and Dan Levangie, President, Insulet Drug Delivery. A replay of this call will be archived on our website. Our press release discussing our first quarter results and second quarter and full year 2015 guidance, as well as a document that provides our quarterly revenue composition, are also available in the IR section of our website. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to be materially different from any future results implied by such statements. Such factors include those referenced in our Safe Harbor Statement, in our first quarter earnings release, and in the company's filings with the SEC. With that, let me turn the call over to Pat. Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks Deb, and good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us on the call today. During today's call, we'll cover the following topics. First, I'll provide commentary regarding our first quarter performance, including a brief review of the state of the business and why we feel more strongly than ever about our future prospects. Next Allison will review our first quarter financial performance in more detail. I'll then provide our second quarter guidance and our full-year expectations and update you on the progress we're making on the key strategic initiatives we discussed during last quarter's conference call and some of our early wins. And finally I'll turn the call over to Dan to update you on the exciting opportunities within our drug delivery business. To start, I'd first like to address the factors behind the $7 million difference in our first quarter revenue results of $61 million compared to the midpoint of the guidance of $67 million to $69 million we provided on our call at the end of February. Approximately $4 million of this difference was from our international business, $2 million from drug delivery and $1 million from our Neighborhood Diabetes business. We expect to still realize $6 million of this $7 million in 2015. First of all, we recognized total international revenue of $3.7 million in the first quarter of 2015, which was $4 million below the level that we included in our Q1 guidance. As we discussed on last quarter's call, throughout most of 2014, Ypsomed increased their safety stock of inventory as a hedge against our historical production challenges. Also as I have briefly shared with you they reduced their safety stock coming into this year based on their confidence in our ability to reliably and consistently produce and provide OmniPod product to them. While working with Ypsomed to reduce their days on hand inventory during the quarter, we agreed to further reduce their days on hand target in the second half of March. This change in reduced days on hand target was driven by their desire to further reduce their working capital tied up in inventory and the financial impact of the significant strength of the U.S. dollar. We also expect some additional residual impact in Q2 due to this revised target. In spite of this reduction in Q1 revenue due to the more efficient inventory management, we are bullish about our prospects internationally. Ypsomed has forecasted a more than 40% growth in the OmniPod patient installed base for 2015 which has resulted in their increasing their full year 2015 consumption forecast based on true end-user demand. The 2015 forecast reflects Ypsomed's intended purchases and inventory levels at the end of Q2 that reflect the balance they're comfortable in maintaining to support the revenue growth which includes expansion in certain territories. With our production capacity and inventory levels in balance, we remain confident that our international business will return to growth in the second half of 2015 and for the full year 2016. Our revenue of $5 million in our Drug Delivery business was $2 million below our original expectation. This delta is simply due to our timing of a planned March shipment as the manufacturing of pods for our pharmaceutical partner ramps up. We remain very confident in our full year revenue guidance for this business in the range of $15 million to $20 million. Neighborhood Diabetes revenue was almost $14 million for the quarter approximately $1 million short of our expectations primarily due from the harsh winter weather conditions we experienced in the Northeast in Q1. Those three factors represent a $7 million delta from our 20 \u2013 February 26 conference call. Our revenue of $39 million in our U.S. OmniPod business was roughly flat to Q1 of 2014 and in line with our expectations. The results in this business for the first quarter also reflected expected rightsizing of inventory levels within our domestic distributors. This inventory reduction impact our \u2013 impacted our U.S. Diabetes business during the quarter which we fully anticipated when we gave you guidance in February. As you know approximately 40% of our U.S. Diabetes business runs through a network of distributors. In the quarter, we placed our fourth OmniPod production line at Flextronics, we placed it into production, which increased our production capacity by 20%. It is now increasingly evident that we are able to supply high quality product in time to meet our U.S. distributors increasing end user needs, compared to the early days of our new product launch in late 2013 and 2014 when we had less than 50% of our current capacity. So, it makes perfect sense for all of our U.S. distribution to reduce their days on hand inventory. We are confident that our U.S. distributors are at a reasonable level of inventory at the end of Q1 and that their future prospects will reflect end user demand. During the quarter, we made great progress building out a world-class marketing and sales organization under leadership of Shacey Petrovic, who joined us in February. Shacey has rapidly added sales executives to her team, dramatically improved our sales and customer training functions has already begun to deliver significant improvements. We are very excited to report that our new patient starts in the first quarter reached an all-time record high for any first quarter in the history of the company, up double digits versus Q1 of 2014. We also saw up 36% in new patient starts for those under the age of 20. We attribute these initial results to our focus on delivering our clinical selling message to physicians and their support teams through our comprehensive and focused medical education program launched during the quarter. These results also reflect increased management focus on physician targeting and improved execution. We are very excited about the early returns from our U.S. commercial team. Based on achieving Ypsomed's revised days on hand inventory targets in Q2, the 40% year-over-year increase in their installed base, and our strong outlook for our drug delivery business, and the early very positive traction of our U.S. commercial team, we are reaffirming our full-year guidance of $305 million to $320 million. I'm incredibly excited about our growth prospects for the second half of 2015 and 2016. Before I turn the call over to Allison, I would like to take a minute to thank her for her significant contributions during her seven-year tenure with Insulet. As we announced earlier this month, Mike Levitz will join us next Monday as our CFO, bringing over 15 years of public company financial experience, a deep understanding of the medical device sector, and a proven track record of success. His expertise leading global financial organizations will be valuable as we execute our strategy to position Insulet for accelerated growth. We greatly appreciate Allison's many years of dedicated service and wish her only the very best for the future. Allison? Allison Dorval - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Pat. I've enjoyed being part of the Insulet team these past seven years and have complete confidence in the company's success moving forward. As I review our results unless otherwise stated all of the commentary regarding changes will be on a year-over-year basis. In the first quarter we recognized revenue of $61.2 million, an 11% decrease compared to $69.2 million. A breakdown of first quarter 2015 revenue is as follows; Our U.S. OmniPod franchise was $39.2 million compared to $40.8 million. Drug delivery was $4.7 million compared to $1.2 million. Neighborhood Diabetes was $13.6 million compared to $14.4 million and included approximately 5% OmniPod revenue. And lastly international was $3.7 million compared to $12.8 million. Consolidated gross margins increased to 54% compared to 47% reflecting operational improvements coupled with shifts in geographical and business line product mix. Operating expenses increased 19% to $41.4 million from $34.7 million. Of the total operating expenses, $2.4 million in Q1 of 2015 and $200,000 in Q1 of 2014 related to management transition charges within R&D and G&A. Approximately half of the operating expense increase was within sales and marketing with the other half split between R&D and G&A. Net loss of $11.8 million compared to $6.1 million the main difference between net loss and our $8.6 million operating loss was $3.2 million of net interest expense which primarily related to interest on our 2% convertible notes. $1.9 million of net interest expense was non-cash. Our cash balance was $145.6 million at the end of March compared to $151.2 million at December 31. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Pat. Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Allison. We firmly believe OmniPod is the most innovative and differentiated insulin delivery pump on the market and has significant potential in other drug delivery applications. We continue to lay the foundation to ensure we remain well positioned for continued accelerated growth and global adoption. We're developing the right strategy making the right investments and implementing the strategy in a comprehensive and disciplined fashion. I'm extremely confident we have the right team and the proper focus to excel and win in all facets of our business. Turning to the second quarter revenue guidance, we believe top line revenues will be in the range of $67 million to $70 million down 3% to 4% \u2013 7% from Q2 of last year and consistent with our expectation that 2015 growth will be in the second half. Let me now take a few minutes to recap the progress we've made during the quarter. Our U.S. commercial restructuring and expansion efforts are well underway and we've made exciting progress on strengthening our sales organization and our capabilities. To-date we've filled approximately 75% of the open field positions. We revised our sales incentive and training programs along with rigorous performance measures to drive greater accountability. As I previously mentioned, we saw significant improvements in generating new patient starts and while one quarter does not make a trend, it does show we believe we have opportunities for near and long-term growth. One opportunity I mentioned in our Q4 conference call is to improve the retention rate of our OmniPod users. Although our attrition rate remains consistent with prior quarters at 9%, a small improvement in that rate can make a big difference since reorders represent about 90% of our OmniPod revenue. One opportunity we've identified is to standardize and improve our new patient training for the OmniPod product. We've added expert personnel to our commercial team with a view toward improving programs by providing world-class training tools and support. These efforts aim to ensure our patients get off to a great start with OmniPod that they achieve improved A1C control and remain on the product for life. This team is assessing our current onboarding program, identifying key areas where we can quickly add value and developing a long-term strategy for patient training excellence. On the marketing front, we're also making significant success. As I touched on during our last earnings call we've been focused on increasing patient awareness of the OmniPod system and increasing health care professionals and managed care's plans understanding of our product's clinical and economic benefits. During Q1, we launched our peer-to-peer physician education program with a little more than half a dozen programs completed and another 45 scheduled. Initial feedback is very positive and we are pleased with the results. We are further driving our customer segmentation marketing initiatives in order to better connect the patients depending on their specific needs. We've aligned our marketing team in several key areas including pediatrics, each with a specific customer focus. These newly focused teams are developing strategies to drive increased adoption of OmniPod in their respective customer segments. On the market access front we're pursuing multiple parallel paths to secure Medicare coverage as quickly as possible. Today when an OmniPod user turns 65, after benefiting from the unique advantage of OmniPod for years, they may be forced to either pay cash for their supplies or potentially go back to multiple daily injections. I get letters from patients all the time who are unhappy with the lack of Medicare coverage for OmniPod and my highest priority this year is to gain Medicare and Medicaid coverage for the product. Finally we've had senior level private payer discussions on the clinical benefits of OmniPod. Payers are pleased and interested to see the clinical data. As I've mentioned in the past our strategy is to provide more clinical evidence as quickly as possible to demonstrate the clinical and economic benefits of OmniPod to patients, payers, and providers. Turning to R&D, we continued to make progress on development of our new personal diabetes manager and remain on track for filing the 510(k) by the end of the year. This new PDM will have a modern user interface with touchscreen technology and incorporate Bluetooth low energy capabilities. Our clinical trial with Lilly remains on track and we have scheduled meetings with certain investigators for this summer. We've also launched an artificial pancreas project with a team focusing initially on algorithmic evaluation and our customer requirements. We remain focused on investing in efforts to drive innovation and next generation game changing technology. Our investment in our overall customer experience includes continually enhancing our portfolio to broaden value to our patients and to our other stakeholders. We're focused on our road map and plan to invest more in our research and development efforts this year to support this plan. We will share more with you on future calls, once we complete a thorough strategic review of our key initiatives and any investment required. I'd like to now turn the call over to Dan Levangie to discuss the tremendous opportunities with our Drug Delivery business. Dan? Daniel J. Levangie - President-Drug Delivery Division : Thanks Pat. I'm very excited to have joined the Insulet management team and see incredible opportunities for growth within our Drug Delivery business. As we said earlier, we feel very good about our 2015 Drug Delivery revenue guidance of $15 million to $20 million. As you may be aware, today Insulet has two very important non-insulin drug company partners with Ferring Pharmaceuticals and Amgen. We diligently work to support these customers and their patients while responding to a fairly robust stream of incoming projects. Our Ferring relationship is long-standing and still has the potential for growth. And as we've reported the Amgen product was introduced to the market during the first quarter. In addition to these revenue generating agreements, we have additional agreements in place and are active in early-stage development programs with a number of other companies each with a therapeutic agent that could become a major advance in their respective category ultimately delivered using our OmniPod technology. Keeping in mind that these early-stage projects came to Insulet with very little if any outbound commercial effort our intention now is to be proactive in pursuing other Drug Delivery opportunities. Since I joined the leadership team in February, we've had \u2013 we've begun to sort through the universe of currently marketed subcutaneously administered drugs and have found a substantial number of commercial opportunities that we will vigorously pursue. To exploit these opportunities, we've started to build a sales, marketing and medical team and have added to our manufacturing operations and product development teams to support what we predict will be a portfolio of exciting drug delivery programs that will generate substantial revenue and profits for Insulet in the future. We expect to make additional investments in our Drug Delivery business during 2015. We'll initiate our proactive commercial efforts in June of this year. And we'll provide as much transparency as possible, given the confidential nature of these early-stage programs. And the comparatively long timelines from initiation to marketing approval and revenue generation. In summary, we're enthusiastic about our progress to date and are building the internal capabilities to aggressively pursue and capitalize on the number of attractive Drug Delivery opportunities. Ultimately we believe that the OmniPod technology can improve patient care by reducing dosing, complexity and improving patient compliance with what in many cases are life saving therapeutic interventions. With that operator, I'd like to have you open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. We ask that you keep your questions to no more than two. But please feel free to go back into the queue and if time permits, we will be more than happy to take your follow-up questions at that time. Our first question is from Tao Levy of Wedbush. Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Great, thanks. Good afternoon. Maybe we could just first start off, just make sure I understand \u2013 here in the first quarter, the Drug Delivery business that was up by a few million. How come you weren't able to manufacture that product? And just because my understanding was \u2013 this was product that was supposed to have been sold or filled in the fourth quarter, the approval didn't come until late and then now it sounds like there's maybe some more manufacturing changes that need to happen or ramp up, so that you can fulfill the rest of the Amgen order is that... Daniel J. Levangie - President-Drug Delivery Division : Yes. Let me try to explain. So the approval of the Amgen product didn't occur until late in the fourth quarter. So we were not able to build product prior to FDA approval. And it's important to keep in mind that the Drug Delivery product is different than our diabetes product. The differences are in the supply chain and in the manufacturing and sterilization process. And as a result of that, these longer lead times and longer sterilization interval caused us to come up a bit short during the quarter. We've got that under control now, we are manufacturing product. We have product in the sterilization process right now and we will make up this $2 million shortfall before the end of the year. Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then my follow-up as you look at the guidance for the second quarter, it sounds like the big delta there is coming from the international side of the business. Maybe you can, again, I know you talked about it in the call but just give a little bit more clarity as to what you are seeing in that business that gives you confidence that these orders are going to start taking place again in the second half of the year. And the revenue that you generated here in the first quarter how does that flow through in terms of what we'll see in the second quarter? Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: First of all I think we're very confident with Ypsomed's prospects for all of 2015. Dan, Shacey and I travelled to Switzerland and met with their team earlier in the first quarter. And I would say they have a very strong plan to provide increased \u2013 40% increase in their installed base in 2015 over 2014. And in addition they're going into additional territories during this year. So we're very optimistic about their prospects. They have a very good plan in place and we're very confident on their ability to execute. I think the challenge for us in the second quarter is the residual impact of them wanting to reduce their days on hand inventory due to their current \u2013 due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. It's \u2013 the U.S. dollar has had a significant impact I think on many multinational companies this year so far and I think this is an impact that we're seeing on our business. Which is they buy the product in U.S. dollars but the Swiss Franc obviously is subject to the strength of the U.S. dollar and they wanted to reduce their exposure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Shaun Rodriguez of Cowen & Company. Shaun K. Rodriguez - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. So first I wanted to follow-up on the last so just to be clear I think the initial expectation and guidance was for OUS revenue to be about flat for the year and you talked about expecting to grow again in the second half and grow for the full year in 2016. But to be clear is the expectation still about flat or is the updated view on OUS that we should be expecting a decline? Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We expect it to be flat versus last year. And essentially what's happening is that the growth that they're going to see is picking up for the reduction we're doing in the inventory. So flat year-over-year. Shaun K. Rodriguez - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. So still flat year-over-year. And I guess as a follow-up on that, it does sound like you spent a lot of time with Ypsomed in March. Can you provide an updated perspective on what's giving you the comfort that them launching their own pump in the coming months won't be a significant factor in their expectations and your expectations from them for OmniPod? Thank you. Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I think the difference there the Ypso pump, which we spoke about with them in earlier in the first quarter is focused on the lower resource areas of the market and where they are would be opted out of tenders that are basically focused on cost. The OmniPod is positioned completely differently and we don't see any cannibalization occurring between those two market segments. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy of Leerink Partners. Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC : Good afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Patrick, I was hoping you could comment on reiterating guidance despite the lower first and second quarter, at least relative to consensus. And it's very back end loaded. And so one of my questions is as it relates to the U.S. OmniPod new patient starts very positive commentary from you and encouraged to hear that. How are you feeling relative to how you're thinking about the growth in new patients for the year? Do you feel better about that 20% plus year-over-year new patient growth number as we exit \u2013 as we get into the back half of the year, or do you think that \u2013 are you sticking to that number? I guess, I'm trying to get to is there potential upside given your positive commentary and what you're seeing so far in Q1? Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think that one quarter doesn't make a trend, so I think we're going to need to get some more experience under our belt as we get into Q2. I would say that the commercial team in my view having really started very much early in the quarter and the year joining very early in January really hit the ground running and I think have had a significant impact and exceeded my expectations on their ability to really have an impact this quickly. So I think all of the signs are pointing in the right directions. But we've got work to do. And we want to make sure we've got all of the foundations in place to make sure that we've got a very solid commercial effort. It's going to take some time marketing to the payers and to the clinicians with some of the preliminary clinical data that we've got. So we've got to build out the marketing message before we get too overly optimistic. Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC : Sure, that's fair. And then on the Drug Delivery business, just trying to get a handle on exactly what is in guidance. It's very early days, so I just want to confirm that it's just Amgen in guidance for this year and if not maybe how much of Amgen is included in guidance and before I drop Allison, I just wanted to say we'll miss you. It was great working with you. Thanks so much, guys. Daniel J. Levangie - President-Drug Delivery Division : Yes. With respect to the Drug Delivery guidance, we've got two commercial relationships one with Ferring, the other with Amgen. The Amgen is the new edition, so you would expect that the lion's share of the growth will come from that relationship. But overall it's $15 million to $20 million for the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan. Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. So let me just clarify a couple of items here. So I want to make sure we heard you right. So you still expect even with the first half shortfall from Ypsomed that your OUS revenues will be flat year-over-year at the $50 million you reported last year? And then the second question is the U.S. OmniPod sales were down 10% sequentially but you said the attrition rate held at 9%. And I just want to check are you sure about that, and are you sure \u2013 how confident are you in that attrition number and then is that 10% decline really all inventory de-stocking at your distributors because that's a pretty big drop-off? Thanks. Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We did have de-stocking in the quarter that affected our U.S. OmniPod business. Your first question I think was on Ypsomed. Yes Ypsomed \u2013 I'm sorry, we expect our international revenues to be flat. We do see a residual effect of the inventory days on hand reduction target. That was a reduction made in March that we're going to have some residual in Q2 as a result of that. And one of the other things Mike to remember is that about 25% of our OUS business comes from our other distribution partners in other parts of the world, Canada and Israel. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brooks West of Piper Jaffray. Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Hi, thanks for taking the question. Pat, obviously a lot of concern around the international guidance. And maybe you could just help us a little bit more with the mechanics of that. You know, I know that these aren't contractual orders from Ypsomed as they talk about build in the second half. But generally when \u2013 how do you ship those throughout the quarter? Is it right at the end of the quarter? And what's your visibility into that ordering pattern? Is it a three month? Is it a six-month and a hard visibility into those patterns out of that partner in particular? Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We have full year visibility into Ypsomed's plans and what their expected out of their door sales are going to be into the end-user markets, so we have \u2013 those sales projections that they are focused on. And then you back that into the days on hand inventory that they want to be \u2013 that they're comfortable with. And what we saw in the back half of March was their desire to reduce that days on hand even further than they \u2013 we anticipated at the end of February. So it was taking it down even further based upon our ability to manufacture and supply product to them and the strong increase in the value of the U.S. dollar. Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Okay. But they could absolutely do that to you again if their forecast doesn't come through, I think that's what we're trying to get to? Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We are developing a new relationship with Ypsomed. As I mentioned Dan, Shacey and I went over there, we're going to continue to go over there frequently. We have our head of operations over there as we speak working on improving the supply chain delivery of product and trying to help them get it much more quickly. So I think it's a new relationship. We've got a person on the ground in Europe that his total focus is on Ypsomed. So I think we're developing a new relationship, we've got the constant dialogue in and are very confident about their projections for the future. We're working hand-in-hand with them, supporting them in expansion in new markets that they wanted to open up previously that we're going to open up this year. So I think it's \u2013 we're very optimistic and very pleased with their performance thus far and confident in the future. Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Then for a follow-up one of the questions I get a lot from investors is you've put together a great management team, but you don't really have anybody on the team that has deep diabetes experience. I wonder if you can just react to that and maybe as you are now a little bit further into this, relate your experience in diabetes versus some of the other businesses you have run the past? Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I would say the senior management team has \u2013 doesn't have direct experience in the diabetes space. They do have a lot of experience in growing new and innovative products into medical device markets and have been extraordinarily successful. And all have dedicated themselves to learning the diabetes market extensively. And to counter the other piece of it we have a medical director on board. We have our clinical services managers in the field that interact with not only the sales folks, but with our management team to help us learn the diabetes business and some of the nuances and the attributes of the diabetes space. So I'm very comfortable that with the existing capabilities we have within the company as well as our dedicated team to learn diabetes that we'll learn it in short order and have a very positive impact in this space. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jayson Bedford of Raymond James. Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hi. Good evening and thanks for taking the questions. I don't mean to be redundant with these questions, but on the international guidance can we assume what's baked in the guidance is a contractual minimum or are there contractual minimums for Ypsomed in 2015? Allison Dorval - Chief Financial Officer : There are contractual minimums for Ypsomed in 2015. What we've baked into the guidance is actually reflective of what they are saying their end-user demand will be for 2015. Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then my second question is I realize the U.S. OmniPod business was down slightly but can you give us an idea of the year-over-year growth in the direct U.S. OmniPod business? Allison Dorval - Chief Financial Officer : We have not \u2013 we haven't broken out the pieces between direct versus the indirect U.S. business. We're comfortable with the breakout that we've provided so far. It's on our website on the Investor Page. That's probably as far as we are willing to go with the breakout for now. Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Bill Plovanic of Canaccord. William J. Plovanic - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Good evening. Can you hear me okay? Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Got you, Bill. William J. Plovanic - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Good. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess I'd like to focus on two things. One on new patient starts \u2013 you gave us a number it was the best quarter ever. Just on international could you clarify was that up or down year-over-year and kind of where are you on new patients? And I know you're saying the business will be flat year-over-year but do you think there will be growth in the new patients international and what will that be? And then that same question for the U.S. business? Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: On the international side, as I indicated, Ypsomed will grow or anticipates growing their installed base by 40% 2015 over 2014. We give you the census of the installed base in January and we're going to update that on a yearly basis not on a quarterly basis for the total patient population worldwide. So I think you've got enough information from back in January to I think triangulate it. William J. Plovanic - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Okay. Would you say Q1 was indicative of the year for Ypsomed, or can you not \u2013 since they are destocking, they would also be destocking starter kits so you just can't see that yet? Allison Dorval - Chief Financial Officer : We have visibility into their quarterly new patient starts. And I would say that their first quarter new patient starts were in line with our expectations on what they were planning for the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy. Raj S. Denhoy - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Good afternoon. Maybe I can ask a little bit about some of the expense lines. The gross margins were strong in the quarter my sense is that's probably because of the mix between U.S. and international. But how do expect gross margins will trend over the balance of the year? Allison Dorval - Chief Financial Officer : Raj, I think for the full year as we talked about on our last call, we do expect a lot of our growth this year to come from our U.S. business and our drug delivery business. Both of those are the higher margin revenue lines for us. So I expect that what you're seeing in Q1 should trickle throughout the year. Raj S. Denhoy - Jefferies LLC : Okay. I guess with a caveat there that as international picks up very strongly in the back half as you're suggesting that that should start to bend that back down right? Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well we're going to get lift from our going direct in Canada, which we expect to do at the end of the second quarter or early third quarter. Raj S. Denhoy - Jefferies LLC : Okay, fair enough. And then on the operating expense lines the $41.4 million I think is a new high watermark for you guys in terms of overall spending. Should we expect that you're going to keep it plus or minus that $41 million level for awhile now? Or how should we think about that? Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think some of that $41 million as Allison mentioned had some one-time stock comp charges or other one-time charges. I think as we look at the revenue plan that we have as well as the opportunities to further develop the OmniPod product as we look at CGM integration and focusing on the artificial pancreas opportunity, in addition to some of the investments we're going to need to make in the drug delivery opportunities to build that business out, I think we're likely to be investing. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew of William Blair Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great, I've got a couple of questions. Thank you for taking the call. Given that in the U.S. or in general new patients in a given quarter don't have a lot of impact on reported revenues and we've got this big second-half, first half change in revenues, is that second-half spike only usage or is there an assumption of inventory recovery in the back half baked into the guidance? Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think that we will have the balance of the inventories in both international distributors as domestic distributors will be right sized so everything will be reflective of end-user demand. We won't have that underbrush. Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just as \u2013 maybe a question for Dan since we haven't had him on the call before. If you look out say three to five years, Dan and you've had some time to work the opportunities on the new drug side. What percentage \u2013 what's your goal for revenue from that business? Is it $20 million? Is it $120 million? How do you think about where we can be in that longer horizon, because obviously, the insulin business is going to do what it's going to do here with all the new efforts. But this is the kind of the greenfield opportunity for you guys. Thank you. Daniel J. Levangie - President-Drug Delivery Division : Yeah I'll just say Pat has set much higher objectives for me than the ones you've just described. However we have not given any guidance past the 2015 and I don't think we are prepared to do that right now. Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: But as you look at the opportunity, I'll have to chime in here. As you look at the opportunity I think as Dan described there's a number of drugs that the use of the OmniPod technology for subcutaneous drug delivery is tremendous. And I think as I have said before and still believe that the Drug Delivery business can be in the long run larger than our diabetes business. But it takes longer and it's higher risk obviously because of the FDA process. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan. Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Thanks for letting me back in queue. So, just to clarify on maybe two items. So number one Pat the assumption that sales are flat internationally does that assume that there's a, sounds like maybe a significant stocking order with the new distributor in Canada in the third quarter? And maybe go ahead and do that one and then I'll circle back on the next one. Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, Mike. We're going direct in Canada as I indicated at the end of this quarter or early next quarter. And there is no \u2013 we will be \u2013 that will be our inventory in Canada. So there won't be any significant stocking order at all. Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then maybe just two quick follow-ups. So the new patient growth there's people confused whether that was a worldwide number or U.S. number and given the history, it's probably worth clarifying which of that that is. And then the whole commentary around the Amgen order and the fact that you weren't able to give them the supply you expected in the first quarter. It sounds like you're not expecting to make that up in the second quarter either. And that it's actually going to take longer. Can you just maybe just clarify this why it's not an issue of it slipping a month, but sounds like may be slipping a few months? Thanks. Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'll hit the new patient starts. I apologize I should have indicated the new patient starts that I indicated being the record in the first quarter was U.S. only. It was the \u2013 with a new team it's hard to find a metric that they could have an impact on in the same quarter in which they came. And so I chose that as the metric or as an indication and that was U.S. only. We've not given any new patient starts growth in international. Daniel J. Levangie - President-Drug Delivery Division : Yeah. And I didn't mean to confuse. The product that we weren't able to get out the door, the Drug Delivery product we weren't able to ship in Q1 will ship in Q2. Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. So you will recapture what you lost in the first quarter you'll get that \u2013 so in that second quarter, in that lowering of the second quarter guidance, you're actually assuming that you make up the non-insulin piece in the second quarter, so the shortfall relative to your prior model is just OUS? Allison Dorval - Chief Financial Officer : The full-year model Mike, or.. Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : No the second quarter. I'm talking about the second quarter. So you guys lower \u2013 you were originally expecting the second quarter to be $67 million to $70 million, you lower that by $3 million. It sounds like actually the Amgen business will be more than you're assuming because you'll catch-up in that business, but your net is still $3 million lower? Daniel J. Levangie - President-Drug Delivery Division : No the second quarter guidance was $67 million to $70 million. Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. And now you're at $64 million to $67 million? Daniel J. Levangie - President-Drug Delivery Division : No, I don't know where you got that from. Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I just on the prepared remarks indicated Q2 guidance at $67 million to $70 million. Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, my bad my apologies. And then just maybe one last clarification, the US OmniPod business \u2013 does that grow in your thinking in the second quarter? Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. It grows in the second quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of from Suraj Kalia of Northland Securities. Suraj A. Kalia - Northland Securities, Inc.: Good afternoon everyone. So Patrick, my apologies, just been juggling between two calls in case you guys already mentioned this. Did you highlight who your CGM partner is for the artificial pancreas project? Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We have not highlighted who our partner is, our artificial pancreas CGM partner. We're exploring opportunities. We are in discussions with Dexcom. They have \u2013 we have worked with an agreement with them to provide their G5 sensor potentially providing data to our OmniPod PDM. And think that they are a very promising and strong candidate. And I also would say, we've had discussions with them and we'll continue to have discussions with them along those lines. Suraj A. Kalia - Northland Securities, Inc.: Fair enough. And in terms of Q3, Q4 Patrick, I know and forgive me if you've already mentioned this, for the U.S. OmniPod side of the business, what are the net patient starts that you guys are assuming? Or at least that you can give us some directional color and I'm saying net of attrition because even there the U.S. business has to see a pretty big ramp up in Q3 and Q4. Any color would be great. Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We expect new patient starts to continue to be increased throughout the year. But again, if you look at the new patient starts in any given quarter, they are a small fraction of the overall OmniPod revenue and the vast majority of the revenue comes from the reorders. So, we haven't given guidance on new patient starts for the year. It's all baked into our guidance overall for the $305 million to $320 million in overall revenue for the business. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Cooley of Stevens. Chris Cooley - Stephens, Inc.: Thank you. Appreciate you taking the questions. I just have two maybe main questions. One could you speak to utilization trends that you saw both domestically and abroad within your OmniPod wearer base? I'm still trying to do some of the math here as I think about the adds on patients and your growth targets? And then secondly, just when we think to the drug delivery business and specifically in June, could you kind a remind us what we should be looking for maybe more specifically as you initiate those for active \u2013 commercial activities kind a what or some of the metrics that we can be looking for at that time? Thanks so much. Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think on the OmniPod utilization, I would characterize it as remaining unchanged. It's basically been very consistent. Drug Delivery? Daniel J. Levangie - President-Drug Delivery Division : Yeah. As I said we're going to begin our commercial activities in June. We have identified a target list of pharmaceutical properties that we're going to go after to try and develop a relationship with, and a development agreement. Today, we have in hand a handful of early stage development agreements and our objective is to add to that throughout the year. We are not going to give specific numbers of agreements, but certainly, we would expect to add several new development agreements to our portfolio during the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bill Plovanic of Canaccord. William J. Plovanic - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. Thanks. If I could just follow up on Mike's question, and then a couple more. On OmniPod you said up. Is that up year-over-year or up sequentially on the U.S. OmniPod business? Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sequentially. We expect it to be up \u2013 I'm sorry. It's up sequentially. That was the way I was thinking about it. I don't think year-over-year quite frankly, flat year-over-year up sequentially. William J. Plovanic - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: That's helpful. And then you're reaffirming guidance but it seems given first half guidance that we are probably shooting for the low-end of expectations? Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We're shooting for the range of $305 million to $320 million at the midpoint. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew of William Blair. Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you for taking the extra questions. I guess as we, Pat, as we talk about what's going on with the new sales organization that you're putting in place, give us a sense of some of the activities in terms of rates or impact that you've already seen versus what that rate or impact may be or what you are assuming in Q3 or Q4? Because you've obviously got to see a nice acceleration in the domestic business in Canada et cetera to get towards those ranges. Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'm not sure what you mean by rate, are you? Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC: Touch points \u2013 you are doing basically \u2013 okay we did 17 in educational efforts in the first quarter we're going to be doing 47 per quarter in Q3 and 50 and you know whatever. I'm just trying to get a sense of how you \u2013 the effectiveness of your field organization is assumed to be different in the back half of the year versus the first half of the year given it's obviously new. Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The sales organization \u2013 the new is the leadership team. The sales organization by and large have remained consistent. We've had only about a 5% turnover rate in the sales organization and I think that's going to be consistent. We've put in place I think incentive plans that have provided more incentive for the sales organization. We're going to be improving the training in the customer service organization so that patients have a better patient experience. We are doing the medical education. We've already done a handful. We've got 45 scheduled. We're going to continue to do that throughout the year and really focusing on managed care. Managed care makes a big difference as everyone knows in this market. And I think we are somewhat handicapped at the moment by our Medicare and Medicaid coverage. We do have some state plans that are covering for Medicare as Medicaid as we speak but we need to get the Medicare coverage to really open this up in a big way and we're focused on getting that done. But I think the sales organization is focused on the fundamentals, the basics, the blocking and tackling, the management of the team making sure that they are making their requisite number of calls per day, calling on physicians. I mean, I think that's \u2013 it's all about the fundamentals and we've got the team in place to drive this execution. And I think I'm confident we saw that in the first quarter, already. Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then Amgen in their call had talked about 800 customers using the product that's a quarter of their large customers, high acceptance, above plan. Are you constraining them at this point with the supply that you are able to provide? Daniel J. Levangie - President-Drug Delivery Division : We've been supplying according to their forecast and in terms of their utilization \u2013 I'd just direct you back to them. But we've been able to supply to their forecast. Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : I'm showing no further questions. At this time I would now like to turn the conference call back to Pat Sullivan. Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you very much. While we took some very definitive and deliberate steps in this quarter that impacted our first quarter results we continue to believe there are many long-term untapped opportunities that exist for Insulet. I'm very encouraged by the progress we've made in laying the ground work to support our path to success. While we're in the early stages of a long-term transition, our experienced senior leadership team and their respective teams have made great progress executing on the key initiatives. We are well positioned to capitalize and improve our commercial execution. In addition to our commercial efforts and our sales and marketing investments that will raise awareness and drive results we're keenly focused on R&D investments to build our leading class products. I'm confident we have a sound strategy, which is in line with, if not exceeding our planned timeline of execution. I'm also confident that our strategy will lead to long-term accelerated growth and shareholder value creation. I can tell you that I'm even more energized now by the many positive prospects I see ahead. With the right leadership, the focused strategy and commitment to consistent execution, I believe we have a winning formula to deliver long-term growth. I'm excited to share with you our progress as 2015 unfolds, and thank you for your participation in the call today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference call over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Deborah Gordon : Thank you, Jonathan. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2015 earnings call. Joining me today are Patrick Sullivan, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Levitz, Chief Financial Officer; Dan Levangie, President, Insulet Drug Delivery; and Shacey Petrovic, Chief Commercial Officer. The replay of this call will be archived on our website. Our press release discussing our second quarter results and third quarter and full year 2015 guidance, as well as a document that provides our quarterly revenue composition, are also available in the IR section of our website. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to be materially different from any future results implied by such statements. Such factors include those referenced in our Safe Harbor Statement, in our second quarter earnings release, and in the company's filings with the SEC. With that, let me turn the call over to Pat. Patrick Sullivan : Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. During today's call, I'll first provide commentary regarding our second quarter performance, including a brief overview of the state of the business and why we are so excited about the many opportunities that exist today and that lie ahead. Next, Michael will review our second quarter financial performance in more detail, and then this third quarter guidance, and discuss our full year 2015 outlook. I'll then discuss the progress we're making on some of our key initiatives, then we'll open the call up for questions. First, I want to briefly touch on the circumstances that resulted in a delay in issuing our [indiscernible] earnings and filing of our 10-Q. As outlined in our preliminary revenue results announcement on July 29, the company initiated a review related to certain revenue recognized in 2014. Since then, we have completed our work looking at these and some similar transactions. The review was scoped and conducted with the assistance of outside accounting and legal professionals. Ultimately, we did not identify any material errors. With that, I'd like to say just how pleased we are by our second quarter performance. As I predicted, our new leadership team has hit the ground running. The initiatives put in place, the changes made within the respective organizations, and renewed sense of urgency, focus and accountability are really beginning to show results. Q2 revenue was $75.6 million, up 5% year-over-year and approximately $7 million higher than the midpoint of our guidance range. While Mike will provide you the detail of our second quarter financial performance, let me share with you some of the highlights of our revenue performance. We have our four products outperformed expectations and our international revenue was as expected based on the forecast provided by our international distributors. Our Q2 of 2015 U.S. OmniPod revenue was $44.7 million, while roughly flat to Q2 of 2014 represented over half of our second quarter revenue [indiscernible]. Since Shacey joined us in February, she has quickly put resources and initiatives in place to strengthen ourselves and marketing efforts. We are very pleased to report that our U.S. new patient starts were up approximately 20% from the prior year and in fact the third highest in the company's history surpassed only by Q2 and Q3 of 2013 when the company completed the full launch of the new OmniPod system. Additionally, we saw more than a 20% increase in U.S. new patient starts from the pediatric population during the quarter, representing an all-time record. In addition to strong new patient starts in the quarter, our higher-than-expected U.S. results were driven by the growing patient base of OmniPod users. We're excited by the early returns from our U.S. team, and while still in the early stages, we believe this momentum will continue and grow in the second half of the year. The results from our emerging Drug Delivery business were terrific. With Q2 revenues of $7.5 million, this will be a significant growth driver for us in the future. In addition to our existing relationships with Amgen and Ferring Pharmaceuticals, we signed additional agreements with pharmaceutical partners during the second quarter. The first step in our proactive efforts was the placement of business development executives in the U.S. and Europe during the second quarter. We're very focused on nurturing our existing relationships with Ferring and Amgen while cultivating new relationships and business with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners. Our Neighborhood Diabetes business generated revenue of $15.7 million during the second quarter, also ahead of expectations. As most of you are aware, this business tends to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, and we expect revenue to be roughly flat to the prior year. Lastly, we recognized international revenues of $7.7 million in the second quarter, which was in line with our expectations. As we discussed on last quarter's call, we worked with Ypsomed at the end of March to reduce their days on hand inventory, and this effort is now complete. Ypsomed continues to forecast a more than 40% growth in the U.S. OmniPod patient installed base in 2015, based on direct end user demand. With our production capacity, inventory levels and balance, we remain confident about prospects internationally, and our international business will return to year-over-year growth in the second half of the year. Before I return the call over to Mike, I would also like to briefly discuss the FDA warning letter we received during the second quarter and the steps we have taken in response. As we've reported previously, we received a warning letter relating to observations noted during the FDA's March 2015 inspection in our facilities in Billerica. The issue noted in the warning letter related to company's release of certain products of the new-generation OmniPod in mid-2013 and the first of \u2013 first half of 2014 which had been identified during the March audit as non-conformant to final acceptance criteria. We responded to FDA within the required timeline and in abundance of caution, we have taken our corrective actions one step further by voluntarily initiating a product replacement of 12 lots in the U.S. and 7 lots in the European market. While the product in these lots were manufactured in compliance with our standard operating procedures and met the final acceptance criteria in place at the time, we have since implemented procedures that have set the product quality bar even higher. We initiated this product replacement proactively and we believe the vast majority of the product is no longer in the field. Through a focused effort of our Insulet manufacturing team, our product quality is now at the highest level on the company's history and we want to make sure that the product in the market today conforms to our current more stringent final quality acceptance criteria. We believe that is what our customers deserve and that's what the company needs to deliver. We are pleased to have received a letter from the FDA last month communicating that they reviewed our written response and the correction action we put in place, and they have identified that the response, our response, appears to be adequate. We also continue to believe that this matter will not have any adverse impact on our ongoing business and operations. To support our continued vigilance in ensuring the highest level of product quality, we have made an addition to our management team appointing Michael Spears to head our Quality, Regulatory and Clinical Affairs Organization. Michael started a couple of weeks ago and reports directly to me. We are thrilled to have him joined the executive team. Overall, I am strongly encouraged by the early results we're generating from initiatives we put in place since the start of the year. I am even more confident our team's ability to build momentum and generate strong results in the second half of the year as well as the 2016 and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike, our CFO. Mike? Michael Levitz : Thank you, Pat. Let me start by saying that I'm very excited to be part of Insulet's leadership team and to have an opportunity to partner with Pat and the rest of the senior team to support our efforts to drive growth and profitability. And to make a difference in delivering such an important medical advance to patients living with diabetes and other diseases. This is a truly remarkable company with many opportunities ahead, given the strength of our differentiated technology, a significant room from market share expansion, and the wealth of experience and talent of our team. As I review our second quarter 2015 results unless otherwise stated, all the commentary regarding changes will be on a year-over-year basis. Our revenue increased 5% to $75.6 million and that compares to $72 million same period last year. And that's driven by growth in the U.S. OmniPod revenue as well as growth in drug delivery revenue as Pat mentioned earlier. Our consolidated gross margin decreased in the period to 45.5% and that's compared to 49.7% reflect shifts in geographic and business line product mix. But more significantly, it reflects additional scrap and warranty charges that occurred during the quarter. As Pat mentioned, we recently implemented procedures with more stringent file acceptance criteria and product quality is now at the highest level. As a result, certain product and inventory did not meet the more stringent acceptance criteria that's now in place. We believe approximately $2.5 million if the incremental scrap and warranty charges in the second quarter were non-recurring in nature. These charges negatively impacted our second quarter gross margins by approximately 4 points. Our operating expenses increased 14% to $46.7 million from $41 million. The largest increase was within sales and marketing where we have been investing to expand sales coverage, customer support and marketing to improve access, customer experience and retention. And that's followed by an increase in research and development, where we have been making increased investments to drive market-oriented innovation. Our G&A expense was lower in the period due to a charge last year of $7 million related to a legal settlement. Our net loss was $15.4 million, and that's compared to a net loss of $29.1 million in the same period last year. And that includes $3 million in net interest expense, primarily related to interest on our 2% convertible note, and $1.9 million of that was non-cash. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $145.1 million, and that's compared to $151.2 million at the end of the last calendar year. Now, turning to third quarter revenue guidance. As Pat mentioned, we are confident in our ability to build on the momentum from the second quarter and generate stronger results in the second half of the year, and our third quarter revenue guidance reflects this. We anticipate our revenue will be in the range of $82 million to $85 million. That's up 11% at the midpoint compared to Q3 of last year. We expect this growth, on a percentage basis, will be driven by mid to upper single-digit growth in our U.S. OmniPod business, growth in the mid to upper teens in our international business, revenue in our drug delivery business of between $5 million to $7 million and revenue of approximately $15 million in our neighborhood diabetes business. For the full year, we are reaffirming our full-year guidance range of $305 million to $320 million and we feel good about the second half of the year, while also appreciating it does represent a significant year-over-year increase in our U.S. and international OmniPod sales. As Pat stated, we are very excited about the early wins we are seeing in each area of our business and we believe the positive momentum as we exit the second quarter will continue to grow in the back half of the year. While we believe there are still risks to the guidance which we walked you through previously, there is also upside, specifically within drug delivery. As a result of our second quarter revenue and our forecast for the remainder of 2015, we are increasing our drug delivery guidance to a midpoint of $25 million from our previous expectations of $15 million to $20 million. The high end of our total company guidance of $320 million assumes even more upside should revenue from the drug delivery product line continue to outpace our expectation. However, that is too early to predict. For the second half of 2015, we expect year-over-year OmniPod revenue growth on a percentage basis will be in the low teens in the United States and to midteens internationally and that's based on continued growth in new patient starts and improvement in customer reorders. To be clear in terms of what this means for international business, we continue to expect the international business to approximate $40 million revenue for the year, which is down on a year-over-year basis due to the destocking of inventory that took place in the first half of 2015 which we previously discussed. And finally, we expect neighborhood diabetes revenue to remain steady at approximately $15 million in each of Q3 and Q4. Since joining Insulet three months ago, I've spent considerable time focusing on the company's near and longer term financial plan to drive growth, profitability and margin expansion. We have a truly differentiated product in a large and growing market. We believe the best way to drive growth and profitability is to increase new patient starts and reorders through improved market access and our focus on a quality customer experience. This year, the company has made significant changes in the management team, bringing on a number of very experienced leaders with a history of success. We have expanded our direct sales force and customer support infrastructure, and we've also increased research and development efforts to drive product improvements and technology innovation. In addition, with the initial success of our drug delivery product line, we are making thoughtful investments to further leverage our tubeless pump technology, the delivery of drugs in areas beyond diabetes. Reflecting all of the organizational changes and these incremental investments, we are currently expecting our operating expenses for the full year 2015 to total approximately $200 million. We are making these investments to support our plans for sustained growth and profitability. Our leadership team is now actively focused on a multi-year strategic planning process. Once this process is complete, we look forward to sharing with you our longer-term vision, our goals, our opportunities and outlook. We believe the company is well positioned to make a significant positive impact for our investors, for our patients and our employees. In summary, we believe the second quarter revenue results are a positive signal that we are succeeding with our transition planning, and we also realize there is work ahead of us to achieve our goals. We look forward to continuing to execute and drive improved results, creating increased value for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Pat. Patrick Sullivan : Thanks, Mike. We believe OmniPod is the most innovative and differentiated insulin delivery system on the market and has significant growth potential in other drug delivery applications. I'm even more confident today that we are driving toward accelerated growth and global adoption. With our full leadership team now in place and our strengthened focus on execution, growth and accountability, I strongly believe we are well positioned to win. I would like now to take a few minutes to recap the progress made during the quarter in executing our initiatives and to share with you some of the exciting recent developments. Our U.S. commercial restructuring and expansion efforts are just about complete and we continue to strengthen our capabilities through our expanded sales organization and focus on marketing activities. Our new sales incentive and training programs along with rigorous performance measures to drive greater accountability are delivering positive results on new patient starts, leads and revenue generation, which position us well for accelerated growth in the second half of the year. We had a very successful presence in the American Diabetes Association Trade Show on Boston in June and hosted [indiscernible] to showcase our OmniPod, our next-generation PDM and our data integration partnerships. We generated a record number of leads at the show and we conducted viable market research with overwhelming positive feedback. We hosted an exciting and well-attended symposium which included a panel discussion by three individuals involved with the artificial pancreas initiative and we had very positive partnership, scientific advisory board and investor meetings. So, overall, ADA was big success for us this year. We continue to work on our next-generation PDM with the ultimate goal of developing artificial pancreas. In addition to the many benefits of our new PDM will provide, we are focused on integrated CGM and ultimately fast tracking in artificial pancreas solution. In addition, given the significant improvements we have made over the past six to nine months to refine and improve our standard operating procedures within the quality and regulatory organizations, we want to be very carefully and thoughtfully ensure all these improvements are fully integrated within our new PDM. With that said, our management team and I have been focused on driving a culture of continuous improvement and accountability across all functions including product development. And in an effort to incorporate viable customer feedback from our ADA market research and our more recently implemented quality and reliability improvements, we're delaying the submission of our next-generation PDM by a few months. We still anticipate a 2016 launch and launched into the market just a few months later, a little bit later in the year. On the market access front, Medicare and Medicaid coverage remains my highest priority and we continue to make multiple \u2013 to pursue multiple parallel paths to secure coverage as quickly as possible. Since my last update last quarter, we've had several very productive meetings with CMS and we've been reading with legislators and efficacy groups as well. With that, operator, I'd like now to open the call for questions. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tao Levy from Wedbush. Your question, please. Tao Levy : Great. Thank you. Good afternoon. A - Patrick Sullivan : Hi, Tao. Michael Levitz : Hi, Tao. Tao Levy : So maybe we can first start with the drug delivery, which I mean, obviously was really strong in the quarter and then you up the guidance. Is that all through your Amgen partnership? Daniel Levangie : Yeah. This is Dan. We've said in the past that Amgen represents the lion share of our revenues in drug delivery. We're not going to give any further visibility into the breakout of revenues. But I would say we're very enthusiastic about what we're seeing with our relationship with Amgen and we're very bullish about our prospects for the year. Tao Levy : Got you. And I mean, do these sales involve stocking type of orders for now and at some point, is it going to slow down, or you're putting out the doors as much as you can manufacture, and then the same thing is happening on the patient side? Daniel Levangie : We don't have access to end user information. I think our partners, either Ferring or Amgen or both, would be the best source of that information. We get a forecast from me to those companies. We build to that forecast and ship product. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein from J.P. Morgan. Your question, please. Robbie Marcus : Hi. This is Robbie Marcus in for Mike. So, thanks for giving me 20% new patient growth number. We also know that Animas grew 32%, Tandem grew 53%, Medtronic grew 9% in the U.S. this past quarter, while your total revenues were up 1%, so not everyone can gain share. So can you help us reconcile that 20% new patient growth number with what's going on in the installed base? And I know, Pat, at ADA, we were talking. You were going through an overhaul of what is your installed base. Are you in a position now where you're able to qualify that and what your true attrition rate is? Patrick Sullivan : Robert, I guess I would say there's no change from what I provided a the J.P. Morgan conference back in January. On a worldwide basis, it was 75,000 patients at the end of last year. It was about 75% U.S., 25% outside U.S. split, and the attrition rate remains about 9%. Robbie Marcus : Okay. So can you help us reconcile that 20% new patient growth with 1% overall OmniPod growth? Patrick Sullivan : I suppose I'm not in a position at this point in time to give you any more color on that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brooks West from Piper Jaffray. Your question, please. Brooks West : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Pat and Mike, I wanted to just circle back to make sure I understood the guidance. So, it sounds like international, you're holding the same with $40 million Neighborhood Diabetes flat, taking drug delivery up, you said at the midpoint of $25 million. So I'm wondering what the range is there. And that leaves us with kind of $180 million to $195 million in U.S. OmniPod. So, I'm wondering, I guess what is the range of drug delivery that would imply that midpoint? And then has your thinking changed on your guidance around the U.S. OmniPod business since you last gave guidance? Michael Levitz : Well, just in terms of the drug delivery business, so we said at midpoint of $25 million. So, I think you could view a range of between $23 million and $27 million, to be at that midpoint. I think that there is a potential for upside which, as I said, would support the upper end of our range but it's still early to tell. We're pleased with the results so far. In terms of the U.S. OmniPod business, I think our view there is around $180 million to $185 million. Brooks West : Okay. Thanks. And then, Dan, while we've got you on the phone, you guys are talking about some new drug delivery partnerships. Any details or kind of timelines that you could give us on what we might hear there? Daniel Levangie : Yeah. We can't give a lot of detail. These agreements are with earlier stage development projects, agreements are confidential. I will just remind everyone that the timelines associated with these development projects are in terms of years, not months. So in the three- to seven-year timeframe is when you would expect to see revenue from any of these agreements. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone from Jefferies. Your question, please? Anthony Petrone : Hi. Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just to stay on Drug Delivery for a moment, just wondering how the Amgen agreement sort of tracks over time, I think if we go back to the initial language around Amgen, it was certainly for one drug which I think is Neulasta at the moment. But potentially, there was a path full with other drugs. So I'm just wondering, is this just Neulasta or eventually do we see multiple drugs out of the Amgen agreement? And then I have a follow-up. Patrick Sullivan : The agreement that we \u2013 the commercial agreement we have in place today is related to Neulasta with Amgen. Anthony Petrone : Right. And I think... Patrick Sullivan : And your... Anthony Petrone : Go ahead. Patrick Sullivan : The other commercial agreement we have is with Ferring. All other agreements that we have in hand, as I've said earlier, are early-stage confidential agreements with pharmaceutical companies. Anthony Petrone : Got it. Maybe just switching gears a little bit to international orders that wasn't touched on here, if we sort of model out the $40 million target for the year, I guess, we're getting third and fourth quarter in the $15 million to $17 million range. So I'm just wondering for modeling purposes going forward, do you sort of see that quarterly range as the go-forward sort of run rate with Ypsomed? Thanks. Michael Levitz : I think what we described is mid to upper teens in terms of our expectations for international growth. Ypsomed has been talking about growth north of 40%. And so there's \u2013 I think that's where the real demand is coming from. As you know, last year, there were some challenges coming after the EROS launch. And so we had certain distributors that were taking on more product to make sure they had product to meet the demand. And so that impacts the year-over-year comparisons, but now that we have \u2013 they've taken down their inventory levels quite considerably, I think that as we move forward in future periods beyond this year that we're going to be seeing straight demand based growth in line with what Ypsomed has been talking about. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Robert W. Baird. Your question, please. Jeff Johnson : Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. I just wanted to touch on the R&D line, obviously, up quite a bit on a year-over-year basis. And Pat, I know you talked about some of the increased investments there. But is this kind of a run rate we should be thinking about on a quarterly basis? And maybe what, from a high level, have you seen now over the last 6 to 12 months or so in your role where you need to step up the investments on the R&D so aggressively? Patrick Sullivan : Yeah. I think as I \u2013 I guess I'm in month 11 since joining back in last September. I think one of the things that has become clear to me is that we need to step up our innovation. I think the company had some challenges with the new generation of the OmniPod launch. In 2013 or 2014, we've talked a lot about \u2013 but now focusing engineering resources on the next generation PDM that we've talked about coming to market next year. And also initiatives in the artificial pancreas that we need to put some resources in that initiative, and I think there's other opportunities for us to continue to grow out the drug delivery capabilities that we have, increase our investments there to provide for what we think is a spectacular opportunity in that particular market space. Jeff Johnson : All right. And so, again, just not to push it too hard, but $45 million, $50 million, somewhere in there kind of a run rate going forward on R&D on an annualized basis, and then any update you can provide on the G5 integration will be helpful. Thank you. Michael Levitz : This is Mike. I would say that I think that we expect our R&D to be north of 10% for the next \u2013 this year and for the next probably a couple of years, and then we expect that to start to move down. So, I think that's a reasonable range, but I'm not prepared to give a specific range on OpEx. But I think the key story there is we do believe there are some very exciting opportunities for investment. We think that it will pay off quite nicely in terms of our opportunities in the OmniPod area and drug delivery as well. And so we do expect some increased investment. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy from Leerink Partners. Your question, please. Danielle Antalffy : Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Patrick, I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit on the sales force add. So you've clearly been adding some sales folks. Wondering how to think about the really great growth that we saw on new patients adds coming from new sales people ramping versus just sort of organic growth and how to think about that going forward as far as the cadence of rep adds over the next few quarters. Patrick Sullivan : Since I have Shacey on the call today, I think I'll let Shacey answer the question. Shacey Petrovic : Thanks, Pat. Patrick Sullivan : Shacey. Shacey Petrovic : Yeah. I mean I think the initial start, the new patient performance is a direct result of the sales force expansion. We have more feet on the street and that increased footprint allows us to better serve our targeted account. So that's clearly driving results and we're excited about what that means for this quarter and what that means for the future. Danielle Antalffy : Okay. And can you give any color on rep adds over the next few quarters or... Patrick Sullivan : We've completely completed our sales force expansion. We're at about 150 people in the field right now and have no plans at the moment for future sales force expansion. I would say that the other thing Shacey has done since she came back, she came in February, was I think really focus the sales organization, focusing them in targeted accounts where really the high prescribing offices identifying those through some marketing research that we did as well as, I think, providing for increased execution against bonus and incentives and all those other elements of sales force execution. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. Your question please. Jayson Bedford : Good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of follow-ups. On the international guidance, the $40 million which I think is a little lower than what we had, but when we factor in your mid-teens guides for 3Q, it looks like the implied fourth quarter guidance calls for deceleration. I'm just wondering why you wouldn't feel a little bit more growth in the fourth quarter internationally? Michael Levitz : This is Mike. I think the guidance, as I see it, to get the $40 million given where we are halfway through the year, in the mid teens, I don't see deceleration. I see it being fairly consistent through the second half of the year. Jayson Bedford : Okay. So the third quarter guidance is mid to high teen\u2019s international growth. Isn't it? Michael Levitz : Right. That's right. Jayson Bedford : And the full-year is 40. Okay. I'll go back to my model there. And then just one on drug delivery. You mentioned you signed the additional agreements. Is there up-front revenue associated with those agreements? Daniel Levangie : Usually not. Jayson Bedford : Okay. Thanks, Dan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Plovanic from Canaccord. Your question, please. Kyle Rose : Great. This is actually Kyle, on for Bill. Can you hear me all right? Patrick Sullivan : We got you, Kyle. Kyle Rose : Great. So, just wanted to kind of circle back on the U.S. business. I guess just two questions. Appreciate the color on the new patient starts. Wondered if you could talk about \u2013 are you still seeing any destocking in the U.S. business? And then, when we're working with our models, I appreciate the color on the attrition, but how should we think about utilization from the existing base patients? Is that still about 10 pods a month? Is it more like eight or nine? Or are there any additional insight into what the recurring base looks like there? Patrick Sullivan : I don't have any additional insight on the recurring base. I would say it's probably similar to what you've probably seen before. Shacey Petrovic : I would just say also that our retention rates have remained fairly consistent across the last several periods. We do see an opportunity there because small improvements in patient retention could drive a lot of value for us. So, we do have strategies and focus in that area. But it's been pretty consistent for the last several years. Kyle Rose : Great. And then just any commentary regarding \u2013 is there still ongoing destocking that you're seeing with some of your distributors? Patrick Sullivan : No. The destocking issue, domestically and internationally, is done. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew from William Blair. Your question, please. Ben Andrew : Good afternoon. Thank you. And I guess first question from me is on the gross margin. About half of the sequential decline was you said one time and you're working on the quality. Can you talk to what it's going to take to get that gross margin just back to where it was on an overall basis, normalized in Q1? And how do you \u2013 are you permanently impaired, if you will, from getting back to kind of the 60%, 65% long-term target? Michael Levitz : This is Mike. I think there are a couple of things. First of all, as I said, I think we had about 4 points of drag because of with what we believe to be non-recurring scrap or warranty costs related to the improved product quality and I think, as Pat said, we're in the midst of the voluntary recall and those other things. So I think that there are going to be some costs as we go into the third quarter. In terms of the year-over-year gross margin, I think that was around 50% last year in the second quarter, rounding-wise, and we are about 4 points shy of that year-over-year. In terms of the first quarter, I think one of the things that impacts our business is mix. And our strongest product mix from a gross margin standpoint comes from our U.S. OmniPod sales and our drug delivery sales, to the extent that we have a higher growth in other areas. Then, that is not as positive to our gross margin. So I think mix will have an impact as we go forward. In terms of the longer-term goals and expectations for gross margin, honestly, I'm really excited about our opportunities there. I think that we have some real opportunities to have it fixed in front of the number there, as we go forward in future period. But there is work to do to get there. Ben Andrew : Okay. And I guess two other questions, one following on that. I mean, your revenues from Amgen are extremely high margin and arguably would have been steady with Q1. So I'm not sure the year-ago comparison is the same because of that. So I'm just curious where that gross margin goes because we've been consistently looking for that to head higher over time. And then second, Pat, kind of a big picture question for you, what would it take for you to put a Bluetooth transmitter in the OmniPod? Thank you. Michael Levitz : Well, I speak to the gross margin question first. I would say that our direct business is where we have the highest gross margin and our distributor less so. And our distributor business in the U.S. is stronger than our distributor business internationally. So to the extent that our mix changes, it can have a real impact on the gross margin numbers. So our international distributor business is, as I said, on the lower end and that impacts us in a particular period. Patrick Sullivan : I would say on your second question, we have the capability of putting a Bluetooth capability in the pod. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Suraj Kalia from Northland Securities. Your question please. Suraj Kalia : Good afternoon, everyone. So Patrick, first and foremost, congrats on the progress. A lot of things going on behind the curtain. So I didn't want to diminish what you guys have accomplished in six months. Let me belabor a point, Patrick, if I could. I know this has been asked twice before, at least forgive me if I don't understand this correctly. If attrition rates are the same, utilization the same, again, you have added new reps and the patient starts are up 20%. I'm somehow not \u2013 I wanted to ask the same question about reconciling with revenues, and I'm also trying to understand did the ASPs changed, any directional color would be helpful so that we can model it appropriately moving forward. Patrick Sullivan : The ASPs have not changed. The attrition rate remains at 9%. And new patient starts were up 20%. I can't \u2013 I can't reconcile your model at this point, but perhaps we can take it offline. Suraj Kalia : Fair enough. And Patrick, in terms of the quality issues you mentioned that were \u2013 that's a corrective recently, what specifically were the quality issues and would this impact gross margins moving forward? Thank you. Patrick Sullivan : Could you repeat that? I'm sorry. I missed the first part of that question. Suraj Kalia : So at least what I heard on the call, Patrick, was there were some quality issues that were remediated because of some initiatives you all have taken. I'm just trying to understand what specific quality issues were remediated, and at the same time, does this cost add an additional cost to your cost line item? Thank you. Patrick Sullivan : Yeah. I think the quality issues that I was referring to relate to the product issues associated primarily with the launch of the new OmniPod insulin delivery system back in 2013 and 2014. Those issues remained. They were product performance issues during \u2013 into 2013 and 2014. Those issues have largely been remediated. But I would say there's always, in any disposable product, or any product, for that matter, there's always sustaining engineering efforts that companies undertake to continuously improve the performance of the product in the field. And that's where we're in right now, the sustaining engineering portion of supporting that product in the field, and we'll always be making improvements. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Haynor from Feltl & Company. Your question, please. Ben Haynor : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Can you just remind us when the destocking impact was done with in the U.S. OmniPod business? Shacey Petrovic : Sure. Most of that occurred in Q1 and some \u2013 the remaining occurred in Q2. So, it's now behind us as we look towards the second half of the year. Ben Haynor : Okay. Great. And then what level of the new patient starts do you believe would be required to return to double-digit growth in the U.S. OmniPod business, and what else \u2013 what other factors go into that? Shacey Petrovic : I couldn't give you an exact number of what the new patient starts need to be to drive that. But I would say that the combination of increasing new patient starts and increased utilization or reduction in attrition by the existing base I think could clearly get us into that realm. Ben Haynor : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Tao Levy from Wedbush. Your question, please. Tao Levy : Great. Thanks. So maybe I'll start with a quick clarification on some of the expenses. In the press release, there's the $3 million charge, and that, I assume, is different than the gross margin impact that you were talking about? Michael Levitz : This is Mike. I'm just trying to look in the press release. The $3 million charge in the press release, are you referring to consisting primarily of severance related to recent management change. Tao Levy : Yes, exactly. Michael Levitz : Yes. And you're saying that was different than the $2.5 million? Tao Levy : Oh, no, no. That's not my question. So that's different than the gross margin that you're talking about... Michael Levitz : Yes. Tao Levy : ...the $2.5 million. Michael Levitz : That is correct. Tao Levy : Okay. So there's $5.5 million of really onetime charges, I guess, in the quarter. Is that right? Michael Levitz : Yeah. $2.5 million was [indiscernible] warranty charges, we believe, are non-recurring and the $3 million was related to the severance. There was a good amount of management transition, as Pat described. Tao Levy : And that $3 million, where is that in the OpEx? Is that in G&A? Michael Levitz : Yeah. The majority of that would be in G&A. Tao Levy : Okay. And then just \u2013 so when I look at the $200 million that you're talking about in terms of OpEx guidance for the year, are you taking any of those \u2013 are you taking that $3 million out or does that include that? Michael Levitz : I've had to include all of the different charges I described. It would be kept. The $200 million, as I said, was OpEx, so it would not include the [ph] scrap and warranty because those are in the gross margin line obviously. But in terms of OpEx, it includes all of the severance and related things that would be within our operating expense category. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line \u2013 is a follow-up from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Your question, please? Robbie Marcus : Hi. Thanks for the follow-up. This is Robbie Marcus again. Maybe just touching on the OpEx again, Pat, when you started you said you were going to do an incremental $15 million spend and now we're at $200 million versus $155 million at 2014. And in this quarter, it was the biggest loss since second quarter 2011. So, maybe help us understand exactly where is this significant increase in spend going to and is it onetime in nature or is this going to continue to grow in 2016 and beyond? Michael Levitz : This is Mike, I'll answer and Pat can obviously add any color to it. I think the \u2013 our view is we really want to build for a sustained growth and profitability in the future. And what we're finding is that there are opportunities for investments that are, in our view, very straightforward in terms of the value proposition. Those are in \u2013 and I think what Pat described earlier is describing expense growth in sales and marketing specifically because that was the initial area of focus. And I think we're seeing the fruit of some of those investments that Shacey described. But what we're also seeing now is that there are opportunities from an innovation standpoint. Whether that's related to the new PDM or whether that's related to artificial pancreas solutions or other areas in drug delivery. Where we believe there is going to be a real payoff, we want to make those investments. So, we are not in this for the short term, we believe that there are some really exciting opportunities. Patrick Sullivan : Yeah, Robbie. I would just add to that. We did add $15 million, as I described at the JPMorgan Conference back in January, to the sales and marketing line item budget. But I think as going through the year here, it's \u2013 I came to the realization that we really need to continue to build the infrastructure to support $1 billion business opportunity that we see five to six years from now. And I think that the level of spend that you described back in 2011 and 2012 or earlier in the company's history did not provide for that foundation to be put in place across the organization, in engineering, manufacturing, R&D, quality regulatory, et cetera. And we're building that foundation, our expense profile will \u2013 shows that, but it's upward getting to $1 billion in revenue five or six years from now. And there's a very clear path to get there. Michael Levitz : And I would also \u2013 this is Mike again. I would just add that we're not just focused on the revenue. I think that, as I say, there are a number of opportunities in margin expansion and operating leverage. So, I think that \u2013 I look forward to the opportunity to be able to speak with you, our investors, about our longer-term views. And that's something that we want to get on the schedule here after we've wrapped up our strategic planning efforts. So that, you can better understand where we see the opportunities going forward. Robbie Marcus : All right. And maybe just a follow-up on Ben's question before on gross margin. So we have 49.5% gross margin this quarter adjusted for the onetime items, Street models are kind of at 53%, 54% for the rest of the year, going to may be 55% next year. Is that too aggressive in your view given the new quality standards, or do you think you \u2013 are those still achievable? Patrick Sullivan : Well, I guess I would just comment on where we see things as opposed to commenting on the Street's expectations. But as I say, I believe that we've got four points that are nonrecurring in nature, but given the mix profile and the opportunities here, I think, in the near term, I think that those numbers you described are higher than what we're expecting in terms of the \u2013 this year. As I look out forward, as I say, I expect us to be reaching about 60%, but that \u2013 that's going to take us some time to get there. And so \u2013 yeah. That's how I see the gross margin coming together at this point. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Anthony Petrone from Jefferies. Your question please. Anthony Petrone : Great. Thanks. Maybe, Pat, just to drill down on $1 billion of revenues over time. Is there any maybe outlook as to how much of that comes from drug delivery over time and maybe how much is from maybe even the core type 1 market? And maybe another iteration to that second question there is, can you review for us where you see pump penetration broadly in the U.S. as it stands today and maybe where you think it can go over the next three years. Patrick Sullivan : Well, I would say that the aspirational goal of hitting $1 billion in revenue five to six years now is one that we have as an organization and are more focused on. I don't think I'm prepared today to give you the breakout of where that could come from. I think that there are tremendous opportunities in drug delivery. There's tremendous opportunities increasing our international OmniPod business, as well as our domestic OmniPod business with the improvements in the product roadmap that we've outlined in front of us. So I think there's a \u2013 we see a clear path to get there and I think we hope to share that with you in a not too distant future. Shacey Petrovic : I think the other part of the question was regarding the market for [indiscernible]? Anthony Petrone : Yeah. Pump penetration into type 1s in the U.S. Is there any update there where that is currently? Shacey Petrovic : I mean there's a number of different sources then they all come out slightly differently but it's approximately 30% to 35% of current type 1 users use pump therapy. And we do see that growing over the horizon. Patrick Sullivan : I would say from my perspective, everybody that has type 1 diabetes should be on insulin delivery system principally the OmniPod. I think we got the best drug insulin delivery system on the market. But I will tell you the impediments to that market adoption, that widespread market adoption, I believe are the lack of clinical benefits and economic benefits that have not been provided to the insurance carriers who were paying for these therapies. So I think that we have a \u2013 we've been working a lot on putting together clinical evidence as well as economic benefit and marketing that to the clinicians and to the insurance carriers. From my perspective, that's the largest obstacle to a very widespread adoption of the technology broadly as a marketplace. So I think we're working to fix that. And I think that given the benefits of pump therapy, everyone should be on pump therapy. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew from William Blair. Your question, please. Ben Andrew : Thank you. I got two. Let me just do it, a touch of math. So if the Amgen revenues are very high gross margin, so you sell it to them for $75 or $80 with volume. Your cost on those should be about the same, if that's correct. That would suggest the $25 million in guidance you would generate upwards of $20 million of gross margin from the Amgen partnership, is that even in the right zip code? Daniel Levangie : This is Dan. So I don't think we're going to confirm pricing to Amgen. You could imagine that's not something we would do, and the device is different than the insulin delivery device and you would expect it to cost a little bit more to make that device than our OmniPod device they're delivering. Ben Andrew : Okay. That's fair. And then, I guess the other question is, Pat, coming back to my other one, do you need to redo manufacturing to put a Bluetooth transmitter in the OmniPod? Patrick Sullivan : We have the capability to put a Bluetooth low-energy device in the OmniPod device itself. Yes, we can do that. Another question \u2013 you would have to make a manufacturing change obviously to do that to incorporate into product, but it's not difficult to do. Operator : Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Pat Sullivan. Patrick Sullivan : Great. Thank you. Before the call ends today, I would really like to reiterate that we are very pleased to report second quarter revenue results coming in ahead of our expectations. Our focus on driving growth is beginning to yield positive results and validates the recent organization and operational changes we've made. While we've got work to do, we strongly believe our revenue results demonstrate our success in executing our key initiatives and our game-changing OmniPod technology can win in the market with a proper focus and execution. We are still in the early stages of a transition. Our senior leadership team is now having a very early and significant impact. I'm incredibly proud and energized by what I'm seeing from the new team and from all the employees at Insulet who work tirelessly every day to raise awareness about our product and to drive results. We're in a clear path to growth and with positive remaining \u2013 and with very positive momentum heading into the second half of the year. We look forward to sharing with you our further progress and reporting our results at future conference calls. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

Wald - The Benchmark Co. LLC Operator : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Insulet Corporation's Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference call over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please begin. Deborah R. Gordon - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Communications : Thank you, Suzanne. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2015 earnings call. Joining me today are Patrick Sullivan, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Shacey Petrovic, Chief Commercial Officer; Michael Levitz, Chief Financial Officer; and Dan Levangie, President, Insulet Drug Delivery. The replay of this call will be archived on our website. Our press release discussing our third quarter results and full-year 2015 guidance, as well as a document that provides our quarterly revenue composition, are also available in the IR section of our website. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to be materially different from any future results implied by such statements. Such factors include those referenced in our Safe Harbor Statement, in our third quarter earnings release, and in the company's filings with the SEC. With that, let me turn the call over to Pat. Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Deb. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I will start off today's call with a brief review of my first year at Insulet and how we are positioning the Company for long-term sustainable growth. I will then comment on our third quarter performance and provide a brief overview of the current state of the business. Next, Mike will review our third quarter financial performance in more detail and update you on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Shacey will then discuss the exciting commercial progress we're making on many of our key initiatives, and then we'll open up the call for questions. First, let me provide a brief review of my first year as CEO. When I joined Insulet in September of last year, what initially impressed me was the incredible innovation and elegant design of the OmniPod for Type 1 diabetes patients. I was also somewhat surprised by the relatively small competitive share that the OmniPod insulin delivery system had in the marketplace. My early conclusion was that there was tremendous market opportunity for the Company to significantly increase adoption of our technology for both the Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes patient populations, and to improve the lives of patients living with diabetes. As you know, there are approximately 1 million patients in the United States currently using multiple daily injections, where 70% of our patients come from. Shacey will explain why we believe all of these patients should be using our OmniPod technology. I also concluded there is an equal, if not larger, opportunity to leverage the OmniPod technology in our drug delivery business. And over the past 12 months I have focused on three key areas. First, establishing the right product positioning of the OmniPod System to capitalize on its unique tubeless features with patients, physicians and payors. I spoke to you early in my tenure about the need for clinical data and evidence for physicians and payors, and Shacey will provide you with our significant progress in this particular area. Secondly, we quickly focused on putting the right team in place to fully capitalize on our tremendous opportunities before us. We have recruited a highly talented and experienced executive team to manage every function of the organization. We are building the organization for long-term sustainable growth. And finally, with the right team in place, we focused on developing a winning strategy for both our diabetes and drug delivery businesses to set us up for long-term growth. This strategy included establishing product development roadmaps for both of our business and to capitalize on the diabetes and drug delivery opportunities. I was very excited when I joined Insulet a year ago, and I'm even more excited today, and confident at the conclusion of my first year that we have the right product, the right team and a winning strategy for our long-term success. And certainly our third quarter revenue results are confirmation of the successful execution of this strategy. Our new commercial team drove terrific third quarter revenue results across all of our business. All four realized year-over-year revenue growth, and three of the four exceeded our revenue expectations. Third quarter revenue of $87.3 million grew 16% year-over-year and was $4 million higher than the midpoint of our guidance range. I think it's abundantly clear that the impact of our new commercial leadership and marketing initiatives have created a strong positive momentum in the marketplace. And as Shacey will describe in her remarks, we are making great strides in significantly increasing our patient base and improving our customers' OmniPod experience. Our third quarter U.S. OmniPod revenue was a record $50 million, representing a year-over-year growth of 12% and almost half of our increase over guidance. In the third quarter, our U.S. new patient starts, which as you know is the early indicator of revenue growth in our recurring revenue model, were up almost 25% year-over-year and almost 10% sequentially. And these new starts represented the highest in the company history. We continue to see strong demand for the OmniPod System in treating U.S. pediatric patients, where the OmniPod has a significant advantage over other tubed options. In the third quarter, we saw an increase of approximately 30% year-over-year and 15% sequentially in this patient population, with these new starts also representing an all-time high for the company. Our international OmniPod business experienced strong growth as well, with revenues up 9% year-over-year to $13.5 million. As a reminder, this growth rate has been and continues to be impacted on a comparison basis with the levels of inventory that ran through the distributor channel last year. While last year's higher distributor inventory occurred both in the U.S. and internationally, the increased international levels were weighted more heavily in the back half of last year. Our third quarter revenue results this year were strong and reflect true end-user demand for both our U.S. and international operations, and we fully expect this strong revenue momentum to continue. The results from our drug delivery business are also strong, with third quarter revenue of $7.1 million, slightly higher than our expectations and flat sequentially. And as a reminder, our second quarter drug delivery results had approximately $2 million in revenue from a delayed shipment from our first quarter revenue. So when you level-set the results, based on forecasts from our customers, this business has trended up sequentially from the beginning of the year and we expect the trend to continue. In fact, on Amgen's earnings call last week, their head of commercial operations stated that their Neulasta Onpro kit, which includes a device based on our OmniPod technology, continues to gain adoption in the marketplace since its commercial launch earlier this year. He also stated the Onpro kit achieved 19% unit share of the U.S. Neulasta units in the third quarter, and that share keeps growing. The continued adoption of the Onpro kit will result in increasing the revenue stream for our drug delivery business. In addition to our two commercial agreements we currently have in place with Amgen and Ferring, we now have an additional six development collaboration in place with pharmaceutical customers. Each of these agreements is similar in nature to the development process we engaged with Amgen, and each represents the potential to contribute significantly to our future revenue growth. In addition to growing the number of agreements we have in hand, we continue to respond to the market feedback in further refining the OmniPod System for use in non-insulin drug delivery. In fact, at last week's drug delivery conference in Vienna, we unveiled two such developments. One, a larger-volume OmniPod device which will provide increased compatibility with volumes of biologic therapies under development by a number of our potential pharmaceutical customers. The second is a product configuration we call the Remote Patient Manager, which allows Bluetooth-enhanced communication capabilities of the drug delivery device. This includes confirming dosing, timing, completion of dosing, as well as tracking patient compliance. Both of these product line extensions are being developed in response to market-driven requirements, and feedback on these product concepts was extremely strong at last week's exhibit. While our near-term revenue will be generated from our current commercial agreements, we are creating a very strong foundation in drug delivery to support long-term, high-margin revenue growth and significant value creation. Our Neighborhood Diabetes business grew 8% year-over-year in the third quarter, generating revenue of $16.7 million, also ahead of our expectations. Finally, driven by our commitment to outstanding product quality, and as previously communicated to you, we increased our product quality standards and expectation. As part of our enhanced quality processes we identified certain lots of OmniPod that had a reported incidence of between 1% and 2% in which the pod's needle mechanism failed to deploy or there was a delay in deployment. The affected product was manufacturing starting in July and shipped in September, with about 10 days' worth of product in the field. Once we recognized this issue, we adjusted our manufacturing processes and implemented additional inspection steps to eliminate future potential occurrences, and we implemented a voluntary field safety notification earlier this week. As you can imagine, I am obviously very unhappy about the impact of this situation, first and most importantly on our customers, and secondly our P&L for the quarter. The voluntary field safety notification was absolutely the right thing to do, and we will continue to raise the bar to provide our customers with the exceptional experience of using OmniPod for their insulin delivery needs. We will never compromise our customer satisfaction and product quality. After a year with Insulet, I can tell you I am even more excited than ever about the tremendous opportunities before us. We see a very bright future with accelerating revenue growth, product innovation, and renewed and strengthened customer satisfaction. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike. Michael? Michael L. Levitz - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you, Pat. As I review our third-quarter 2015 results, unless otherwise stated, all of the commentary regarding changes will be on a year-over-year basis. As Pat mentioned, our revenue in the third quarter increased 16% to $87.3 million, compared to $75 million last year, with growth in all four of our product lines and better than expected revenue in three of our four product lines. The primary drivers of this growth were in the U.S. OmniPod and the drug delivery businesses. We are pleased with our continued strong progress on our growth initiatives. Our consolidated gross margin in the third quarter was 41%. This includes a nine-point unfavorable impact in the quarter related to nonrecurring costs totaling $7.7 million. That's associated with products subject to the field notification that Pat mentioned. Excluding these costs, our gross margin in the third quarter was directly in line with our expectations. Let me walk you through the $7.7 million of nonrecurring costs. As Pat mentioned, in the third quarter we produced product that did not meet the higher quality expectations we have established. We identified the issue and responded in a timely fashion, adjusting our manufacturing process and implementing additional procedures. Approximately three weeks' worth of product had not been shipped and remained in our inventory as of September 30. We have decided that the inventory on hand will not be sold to customers, and accordingly we have recorded a full reserve for the inventory, which totaled $6.4 million. In addition, we accrued for the cost of replacing the shipped product that we expect to be returned. We also incurred incremental costs in the quarter due to inefficiencies in our production process as we identified and rectified this product issue. These costs, together with the inventory reserve, decreased our gross profit in the third quarter by $7.7 million, representing approximately nine points of gross margin. In addition to the inventory on hand as of September 30, we procured an incremental $1 million of inventory at the beginning of the fourth quarter, which is being reserved in full, and the $1 million will be reflected as a charge to cost of revenue in our fourth quarter results. We do not expect any further impact to gross margin related to this issue. Our operating expenses in the third quarter totaled $51.4 million compared to $40.9 million last year, increasing 26%, in line with our expectation. As we have discussed previously, we have been strategically investing in our commercial organization to extend field sales coverage, customer support, and marketing to improve access, customer experience and overall retention. In addition, we have been expanding the infrastructure within our drug delivery organization. And in the third quarter we began incorporating the operating expenses of our Canadian distribution business, which we acquired in July, including amortization of the intangible assets resulting from that acquisition. The amortizable intangible assets total just over $2 million, half of which we will expense in 2015. Also as expected, we increased development spending during the quarter due to our expanded investments in innovation, such as integration with the continuous glucose monitor, the artificial pancreas project, as well as improved user interface, to drive accelerated growth and market expansion. As we previously communicated, these investments include variable spend with contractors as we accelerate these very important projects. Lastly, our general and administrative expense was approximately 9% lower in this quarter. That's in line with our expectations. Please note that in the third quarter of last year our G&A expense included non-recurring charges of approximately $7 million, primarily related to the transition of former management. And that compares to approximately $2 million in non-recurring charges this quarter related to our review of historic revenues, as well as our July product recall. Our third-quarter net loss was $18.9 million and our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $145.5 million. Now turning to revenue guidance. As Pat mentioned, we are very pleased with the success so far of our commercial initiatives and expect the positive momentum coming out of the third quarter to continue. We are therefore raising the low end of our revenue guidance by $5 million and guiding to a range for the year of $310 million to $320 million of revenue. This includes increasing our drug delivery business revenue guidance for the year to a range of $25 million to $30 million, up from our previous guidance of approximately $25 million. This increase is based on forecasted orders that we have today. The drug delivery business continues to grow and represents a very exciting opportunity for us. The high end of our total Company guidance of $320 million continues to assume even more upside, should revenue from this product line continue to outpace our expectations. Excluding the impact of the non-recurring charges I just described, we expect our gross margin for the year to be in line with last year's results. And we also continue to expect operating expenses for the full year to approximate between $195 million to $200 million, and that's reflecting the commercial and product development investments we've previously discussed, to provide a foundation that we intend to leverage as we drive continued strong growth in our business over the coming years. With that, I will turn the call over to Shacey. Shacey Petrovic - Chief Commercial Officer : Thanks, Mike. I am very excited to join today's call and share our commercial progress. We have an extraordinary opportunity with such an innovative and differentiated product, and OmniPod is really building momentum. As Pat mentioned, we have the right product; we have a new, energized team; and we are focused on a winning strategy. This is driving record growth in revenue and record new U.S. patient starts. This year we've had two key areas of strategic focus. The first is to retain our patients through delivering an outstanding new customer experience, and the second is to grow patient and clinician demand for OmniPod. I will first discuss our strategy of improved patient retention and customer experience. We want to get our patients off to the most successful start possible, to ensure that they have great outcomes and they can enjoy the freedom that OmniPod offers for many years to come. To this end, we've made significant improvements in our new patient training program. Specifically, we've improved our new patient training and we've invested in the resources we use to help our patients become confident with their OmniPod from the very beginning. When I joined Insulet earlier this year, I found that less than half of our new patients were being trained by Insulet-employed clinicians, and in the initial training we provided our patients through third-party contracted clinicians, it was anything but standardized. We have changed that approach dramatically. We increased our field clinician team in order to deliver training to more of our new patients. And I am excited to report that our team increased the number of patients we trained by 50%, using our new tools and our standardized approach. Early indications are that this new approach is driving a better patient experience and increased new patient retention. We've also identified opportunities to optimize our internal support processes to improve the new customer experience. Our service levels in the U.S. have improved dramatically, including faster research and delivery of benefits information, higher conversion rates of qualified leads to new patient starts, and improvement on our average conversion time. Ultimately, this focus on enhanced training, service and the customer experience is demonstrating improvements in new patient retention. It is early days, for sure, but the improved new patient retentions trends are very encouraging. We've also made great progress on our second strategic priority, which is to create more clinician and patient demand for OmniPod. Our sales force expansion is complete and it's clearly driving growth, which is evident by the strong revenue performance this quarter. Our team is developing growing clinician appreciation for the unique benefits of OmniPod. We have our field team focused on the highest potential accounts through more effective targeting. They are delivering a compelling message on the clinical benefits of OmniPod and are generating record-breaking U.S. physician referrals and new patient starts. To continue to expand the awareness and use of our OmniPod, we are building stronger clinical evidence to demonstrate to healthcare practitioners and to payors the unique advantages of OmniPod. We have been pursuing clinical data projects in three areas. The first, we want to demonstrate improved outcomes and quality of life associated with OmniPod. The second is to illustrate, in a credible way, the economic value proposition of OmniPod. And the third is to explore innovative models of care that highlight the unique advantages of OmniPod in certain settings and certain patient populations. I am happy to report that we have made impressive headway on the publication front. We now have several clinical studies in process that will demonstrate the clear clinical differentiation of OmniPod. The first of several manuscripts was submitted for publication this quarter, and we expect at least two more to be submitted for publication before the end of this year. We have also worked with a healthcare economics firm to model the impact of OmniPod on a payor's population of patients. This model has been validated and will be used by our market access team to demonstrate the healthcare economic value proposition of OmniPod. We are fortunate to have these efforts bolstered by two highly credible studies published this year. One was an observational study in The British Medical Journal demonstrating reduced morbidity and mortality in patients on continuous insulin infusion therapy in more than 18,000 patients, and the other, a study in The New England Journal of Medicine, showing reduced mortality with better glycemic control offered by continual insulin therapy, also looking at tens of thousands of patients. There is a growing body of compelling evidence demonstrating that continuous insulin infusion improves outcomes, it reduces morbidity and mortality, and it should be the standard of care for patients with Type 1 diabetes. This evidence will help to drive continued robust clinician advocacy for OmniPod, improve access for our technology, and protect and potentially expand reimbursement for OmniPod. We are looking forward to having several exciting peer-reviewed publications demonstrating OmniPod's positive impact on A1c control, its unparalleled ease of use, and the improved quality of life that OmniPod offers our patients. The OmniPod revenue results this quarter are without question driven by the three key elements that Pat mentioned. I'm very proud of our accomplishments during this year and this quarter, and I echo Pat's earlier statements that we have the right product. OmniPod is a truly differentiated and innovative delivery system which we are aggressively supporting with a comprehensive publication plan. We have a new, talented and energized commercial team focused on educating clinicians, patients and payors about the significant advantages of the OmniPod System. And we have them focused on a winning strategy, delivering an outstanding customer experience to ensure successful treatment of our patients over the long term. These are exciting times at Insulet and I really am delighted to be a part of the team. I will now turn the call back to Pat. Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Shacey. I continue to be pleased with our early results we are generating from these initiatives that we put in place since the beginning of the year. And I'm also very excited about the efforts underway which Shacey outlined to further expand the use of OmniPod System and leverage our market insights to deliver an outstanding customer experience in our diabetes business. I'm also equally excited about what we are doing in drug delivery, with six agreements and our commercial success with Amgen, and the foundation we are putting in place there for future growth. We have a very strong team. We are focused on accountability and ensuring a positive experience for our customers, our shareholders, and our employees. With that, operator, let's turn the call up for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of James Francescone of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. James Francescone - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, good afternoon, and thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to get some additional perspective on the manufacturing hiccup in the third quarter. What gives you confidence that you have solved the issue completely, that you are not going to see impacts in further lots? And what changes have you made to the process to ensure better quality going forward? Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, I think what I will start with is why it happened, and then I can go into why I believe it won't happen again. So, first of all we made a change that was cut into the manufacturing lines in July to improve the product performance as part of the sustaining engineering effort that every company goes through. And that changed product passed all existing testing and release criteria that we had in place. But the performance in the field identified a failure mechanism that we had not seen in production, and we have improved our processes and inspection procedures to address that issue. I think, furthermore, as we think about why we will ensure this won't happen again, I would just reiterate that I am very unhappy, from both a patient and financial perspective, with this occurrence. But I think, to the positive, we identified the issue quickly, we took corrective action, and we contained the impact to customers. As many of you know, we hired Mike Spears from Covidien Medtronic, and he has been here now 100 days, with 16 years of quality and regulatory experience to help increase the capability of the organization. With Mike's guidance we are tightening up our processes and procedures to improve product and customer \u2013 improving the customer experience as well as the quality, and we're putting in place the foundation for long-term sustainable growth. And I guess, you know at the end of the day, I don't think we could ever say there's a zero chance it would never happen again. But I would say that with the right people, the focus on processes and procedures, it is possible to significantly reduce that risk substantially. And I can tell you that I am very focused on the manufacturing and quality organization to do the best that I can to ensure this never happens again. James Francescone - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And does the change to the process or procedure have any impact on the structural cost to manufacture the product? Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: There was no change to the structural cost to manufacture the product. James Francescone - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Then maybe just one more on gross margins. If I look, even if we had back $7.7 million in nonrecurring costs, we're going to get up to a margin that's just short of 50%, which is obviously down year-over-year, and down even relative to the first and second quarters, as product mix should be a favorable tailwind, as drug delivery ramps up. So, can you offer any broader perspective on why, even as mix is in your favor, we are not seeing advancement on the gross margin line? Michael L. Levitz - Chief Financial Officer : Hi, this is Mike. I'll answer that question. So first of all, in terms of comparisons, I just want to make sure we're talking about the right thing. So our gross margin this quarter, when you pull out the specific $7.7 million that we just discussed, is higher than where our margins were in the second quarter. You said it was lower; I just want to be clear. But regardless of that, when we look at year-over-year comparisons, there are a couple of other factors that come into play in our gross margins. First of all, there's about a point of gross margin that were impacted by royalties. As I described previously in some public comments, there was a renewal fee that was paid from a few years ago that had been amortizing into the company's revenue, and ended at the beginning of this year \u2013 actually the end of last year. And so that created \u2013 and that's essentially \u2013 that royalty business was essentially all margin. And so that was about a point, as you look at this year versus last year, for Q3. In addition to that, as previously described, we had a price decrease, according to the contract with our international distributor. And that also resulted in a reduction. We do not expect further price decreases there, so that does impact us on a year-over-year comparison. But we do not expect it to impact us going forward. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Tao Levy of Wedbush. Your line is open. Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Yeah, hi. Good afternoon. Michael L. Levitz - Chief Financial Officer : Hi. Shacey Petrovic - Chief Commercial Officer : Hi, Tao. Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: So, maybe we could start with \u2013 since you guys did put up a pretty healthy U.S. new patient number, any changes to attrition rates that you've seen now that you have access to a greater amount of data? Shacey Petrovic - Chief Commercial Officer : Sure. Tao, this is Shacey. I would say that we have early indications that we are making an impact on the attrition of new patients. But it's been a few months and we really want to monitor the trend for a bit more before calling it a significant win. But as I said before, small improvements in attrition can really drive significant value for our business over the long term. And we're focused on providing the best customer experience possible. And so I think that's going to drive significant value; it's just early days at this point. Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Got you. And what are your thoughts on being able to, at some point, move the \u2013 I guess, the selling of the OmniPod in the diabetic setting towards more of a pharmacy benefit manager type area? Shacey Petrovic - Chief Commercial Officer : Well, we're evaluating pharmacy as an attractive potential channel for us. Obviously, we have a unique product configuration that makes us well suited for that channel, where our competitors aren't. And we've seen other successes like Dexcom's in that channel, so we do have an active exploration, I would say. But we are early days for that as well, and we'll certainly provide more detail as it becomes a more viable pathway forward for us. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Brooks West of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Hi, thanks for taking the questions, and congratulations on a really strong quarter. Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Brooks. Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Shacey, I wanted to maybe push you a little bit more on the attrition rates. What's an appropriate goal? And where do you think, over time, you want to see that number? You've been talking about 9%. Can you take that down a couple of points over time? Shacey Petrovic - Chief Commercial Officer : Well, first of all, I would say \u2013 and I know Pat would echo this \u2013 that, you know, the appropriate goal is 0%. We want to deliver an outstanding customer experience. And so, really, our goal is to retain all of our patients as happy, loyal, long-term patients for OmniPod. That said, 91%, a fairly high customer loyalty number and retention, if you look at it across other industries. We believe it's reasonable to think about reducing that 1% to 2% over the next year. And that drives significant value for us. Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Great. And then another question on drug delivery. I get a lot of questions on the sustainability of the Amgen business. And I know you guys have basically a six-month rolling order, but can you talk about what might be \u2013 and I realize you have limited visibility \u2013 but what might be stocking, what might be sustainable for that business? And then with the six new agreements that you're talking about, is anything approaching the scale of that Amgen business going forward? Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So, with respect to stocking versus actual utilization, on their most recent conference call they talked about 19% of the doses of Neulasta administered in the United States were given using the OmniPod device. So that's kind of where we are. Purchases \u2013 or revenues that we generated in addition to that would represent stocking. We think that that's going to continue to grow. That's our second full quarter of OBI, or the OmniPod device delivering Neulasta in the market. So I think we're on a really accelerated conversion ramp here. And our objective would be to convert every dose in the United States of Neulasta to be administered with the OmniPod device. We think that's about 1 million doses. Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): And there's no reason it shouldn't be. Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. With respect to your second question, we talked about six additional agreements that we have in hand. I'd say three of those agreements are with very large pharmaceutical partners. Each of those companies would be ranked in the top 15 pharmaceutical companies in the world. Each of those agreements, we would expect to have a magnitude equal to or greater than the agreement that we have in place with Amgen. The other three agreements are with smaller companies, earlier-stage development agreements. Potentially very large, lucrative agreements for us, but it's a little early to predict. But I'd say we've got a range of opportunities here, some as large as what we think the Amgen opportunity can be, some smaller. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Robert J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. This is actually Robbie Marcus in for Mike. Congrats on a good quarter. Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Robbie. Robert J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. So, one thing I noticed that you didn't give a whole lot of time to in the prepared remarks was the pipeline. So I was wondering if you could take a minute and just lay out your current thinking of the new PDM approval. Are you still going to be able to submit that next year, or is that slipping into 2017? And can you give us an update on your integrated pumps with CGM, both just the display on the PDM, but also more of your artificial pancreas type of pumps, and where that sits right now? Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. I'll take that one. This is Pat. We're on track to submit our Phoenix PDM product to the FDA in the middle of next year, and we would expect to have that on the market or approved by the end of next year. And we are on track and working with Dexcom for the integration of their G5 sensor with the OmniPod device. That said, I think what obviously everyone is seeing is a move to the phone. And Shacey has done some work from our customers to really understand the interest that they have in seeing the pump settings, as well as the Dexcom CGM results, on an iPhone or an Android phone. Shacey Petrovic - Chief Commercial Officer : Yeah. I would say, Robbie, that our market research demonstrates that patients really want to see this information ideally on their phone, rather than their pump. And I think that makes a lot of sense for a number of reasons, not the least of which is, if you look at Tandem or Animus today, their integration is already somewhat obsolete, because Dexcom is launching G5 and they are both integrated with G4. And so we see this desire for the patients to have this information on their phone, and we are evaluating ways, working with Dexcom to evaluate ways to accelerate CGM integration, and maybe using mobile as a way to do that. So, I would say stay tuned at this point. But it's something we are clearly aware of, in terms of our patients wanting to have it. The question is, can we get it where they want to have it? And that's what we're working on. Robert J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And what about your artificial pancreas program? Is there any update there, because we're going to have Medtronic 640G, 670G out pretty soon. Tandem is moving into trials. Is there any update on your front? Shacey Petrovic - Chief Commercial Officer : I mean, Patrick comment, but I would say that the program is very active. We've identified our algorithm partners. We have early clinical and development pathway and pipeline meetings on a regular basis. We are very excited. We believe that our product is the most innovative and the most differentiated. And if we can combine that with an AP offering, we know that it's going to be something that patients want. So at this point I think it's a little early for us to comment on next steps and specifics, but know that it's an active investment and active project here. Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And I would just echo that we are committed to an artificial pancreas product offering. I believe we have the best product configuration and footprint for the artificial pancreas use, and we are committed to get there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Plovanic of Canaccord. Your line is open. William J. Plovanic - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great, thanks. Good evening. Can you hear me okay? Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Got you. Thanks. William J. Plovanic - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. Thank you. One of the questions I continually ask, and I just wonder if you would update, how should we think about \u2013 it was a solid quarter. But how should we think about utilization? Is this quarter in the U.S. indicative what normal utilization for a patient is, i.e., whatever it is, 7 to 8 pods a month? Is that how we should think about the business on a go-forward basis? Shacey Petrovic - Chief Commercial Officer : I would say that utilization doesn't really change, quarter to quarter. So, utilization this quarter is consistent with where it's been, previous quarters. Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I would also say that there has not been the noise in this quarter that we've had historically, in inventory levels and all the other, I'll call it chaff, running through the results. And therefore, this is a very clean quarter from a end-product use by the customers quarter, so you don't have that other noise. So yes, I would say this is a good quarter to use. William J. Plovanic - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: So this is the normalized. So use this as our base rate as we go forward? And then how should we think about \u2013 you had a good new patient number. How much of that was new reps versus existing reps, in terms of driving that total growth year-over-year? Shacey Petrovic - Chief Commercial Officer : The expansion is definitely driving the increased new patient starts. And we did also focus a portion of the field's time on retention, so it's a bit difficult at this point to compare rep productivity. But we are very pleased with the results. Clearly, they are making a terrific impact. The message is resonating and we are excited about the growth that was delivered this quarter. Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: They are doing a great job. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jayson Bedford of Raymond James. Your line is open. Unknown Speaker : Hi, guys. This is Mike Hall (41:12) in for Jayson. Can you hear me okay? Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Got you, Mike (41:14). Unknown Speaker : Thanks. Okay. Nice job in the quarter, by the way. I was hoping you can give us some segment-specific color in terms of your assumptions for the fourth-quarter guidance? I know you gave us the drug delivery number, but we were particularly interested in the U.S. business, given the strength in the third quarter. Michael L. Levitz - Chief Financial Officer : Sure. This is Mike. So, we expect growth for the second half of the year to be in the low to mid teens for both U.S. OmniPod and international OmniPod. So, mid-point of the guidance is around $51 million for U.S. OmniPod, so between $50 million and $52 million, and between $14 million and $16 million for international. So pretty much in line with where we were before, but we are definitely encouraged by what we are seeing with all of the positive momentum. And Neighborhood we expect to be north of what we said before, but not by a lot, so midpoint probably around $15.5 million to $16 million. Unknown Speaker : Okay. Great, thank you. And then can you give us an update -- I'm sorry if I missed this, but an update on obtaining Medicare coverage for the OmniPod? Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, this is Pat again. As I have stated in my previous conference calls, the Medicare coverage for me is my number-one priority, and continue to work the avenues that we have discussed in the past. I would say we're making progress, but we're not there yet. And I think confident that the two approaches that we're taking with Medicare coverage are the right approaches. It's just hard for me to predict exactly when we might achieve Medicare coverage. But I can tell you that I'm all over it. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson of Robert Baird. Your line is open. Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah, thanks. Good evening guys. Just a couple of follow-up questions here, more just on the expense side, I guess. It looks like R&D kind of came back from $12 million to $10 million this quarter. Is this kind of about the run rate we should be looking at here, over the near- to intermediate-term? Or how should we be thinking about that line item? Michael L. Levitz - Chief Financial Officer : This is Mike. So, I think it's fair to say, and I think I've said before, that I expect \u2013 or we expect R&D this year to be north of \u2013 to be in the low teens, low to mid teens. And so I think it was a little bit lower this quarter, but it really is \u2013 it's timing- and project-specific. As things continue to ramp up on the artificial pancreas, that has some impacts here as we look forward, where it would be a little bit higher. But as I said in my remarks, we have a variable spend that we brought in to ramp up these projects, that we can then ramp back down. So, longer-term we expect R&D to be more in line with a 10% rate, long-term. But I think this year, next, it's going to be north of that as we accelerate these important projects. Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): All right. That's helpful. And then just going back to the drug delivery question that was asked earlier, I think Amgen said 8% in the second quarter, 19% in the third quarter. Even if I take that up to 25%, 30% -- a good, healthy number in the fourth quarter \u2013 the revenue contribution to you guys on the sell-through to the patient basis -- I keep coming back to somewhere around $15 million or so, mid-point of guidance this year, $27 million; bump up $2 million maybe for the Lutrelef contribution. Is there anything else contributing within the drug delivery category that I'm missing there? Are any of these early trials or early discussions generating any clinical trial revenue? Anything there, or is it all just \u2013 is the rest of that the inventory build? Michael L. Levitz - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. You are not missing anything, you're just low. Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Ferring is the other. Michael L. Levitz - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, he mentioned Lutrelef. You got Lutrelef in there, but you're just low. We are very comfortable with the guidance we just gave. Operator : Okay. Your next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy of Jefferies. Your line is open. Raj S. Denhoy - Jefferies LLC : Hi, good afternoon. I wonder if I could start with the international business. I'm curious if you think the run rate that has been established in the international market is where we should expect, or whether that business could trend back up to the 40%-ish growth we've seen in years past? Shacey Petrovic - Chief Commercial Officer : We are expecting the international business to be consistent with the run rate that we saw this quarter. This quarter reflected, really for the first time in a couple of quarters, I think, true end-user demand. And obviously Ypsomed has talked positively about the growth in their patient install base, and they are our largest international distributor. Raj S. Denhoy - Jefferies LLC : Okay. So generally, if you think about inventories in your channel, your distributor channel broadly, how do you feel about that level? Do you feel that there's another either reduction or perhaps an expansion in the inventories distributors are carrying? Or are we pretty much right-sized at this point? Shacey Petrovic - Chief Commercial Officer : No, we are right-sized. Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We are right-sized. We're done. Shacey Petrovic - Chief Commercial Officer : Yeah. Shacey Petrovic - Chief Commercial Officer : Yeah, I would say we definitely have. We've seen strong utilization from most of our targeted high-volume physicians. And we have a number of programs, including our Pod Promise program, which we have positioned to help us regain support and advocacy from physicians who may have had patients who had challenges with quality in the past. So I think ultimately physicians \u2013 the message that we have really clinically differentiated OmniPod, and the programs that we have rolled out have been very well received by clinicians and patients. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda of Leerink Partners. Your line is open. Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC : Yeah. Hi, guys. This is Puneet in for Danielle here. Can you hear me okay? Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Gotcha. Loud and clear. Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC : Excellent. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on a solid quarter. Pat, you had talked about earlier, there are certain studies in publications \u2013 and thanks for giving color on that \u2013 that you could potentially take to the payors and really drive reimbursement for this. If you could help us understand, are there certain trials or studies that you want to \u2013 that you want to start into having had \u2013 looked at, what the data that you have, or you feel confident that what you have is good enough to go and take it to the payors? Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think what we initially have right now is sufficient to take it to the payors. But as I, I think, talked about last year, the first and foremost is to take the data that we have in-house, to develop that into data that can be published into the marketplace, peer-reviewed journals. And Shacey mentioned \u2013 I believe that was the one that was submitted for this quarter, that will be the first indication that we will have in published information. In addition to that, Shacey has been working on \u2013 the clinical team has been working on additional studies to show the clinical and economic benefits of OmniPod. And those studies or publications are in various processes of bringing to the clinical community. And we will continue to do this. This is not a once \u2013 do it once and you're done; it's a continuous process, and we'll continue to provide publication and clinical support to provide the patients, clinicians and payors to make the case of the \u2013 the use of OmniPod is cost effective. Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Thanks for that. And just a quick follow-up on that, in your experience, how do you see the endocrinologist responding to this type of data? Would they \u2013 would this change their behavior in terms of prescribing? How sensitive are endocrinologists as a group, as a group of clinicians, to this type of data from publications? Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think all clinicians, for the most part, are absolutely interested. They are data hounds. They love to see the data. And I think the studies and the work that we've done specifically targeting endocrinologists on the benefits of OmniPod will be very helpful. And Shacey, we've already done some already, targeting for physicians. But we've already started that process, and the initial indications are very positive of their receptivity to clinical data. That's what doctors are interested in : how is this beneficial for my patient? Why does it make sense for me to provide this therapy to this patient? If you show them that you can increase their \u2013 reduce their A1c levels, get their glucose more in tighter control, that's a real strong selling message for clinicians. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Ryan Blicker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi, this is Ryan Blicker in for Doug. Thanks for taking my questions. Starting with a follow-up on the pipeline, you talked about two products in your drug delivery pipeline, including one with higher volume and one with Bluetooth capability. These features clearly have potential within your diabetes products as well, for Type 1 and intensive insulin-using Type 2 patients. Have you made any development progress integrating these features into your diabetes products? Shacey Petrovic - Chief Commercial Officer : I would say for, let's see, the large-volume pod, for example \u2013 that would be designed to address patients who have larger insulin requirements, like Type 2 patients or very insulin-resistant Type 1 patients. And there's really two ways you can go after that. You can go after that with a larger reservoir, larger pod, which I think works very well for Dan's side of the business and patients who are wearing the pod for short periods of time. But it might not work as well for patients like our diabetes patients, who have to wear the pod every day. And the other way to go after that patient population really is with concentrated insulin. And that's what we believe the patient would prefer and will provide a better patient experience. And so, that's where we're focused in terms of addressing patients who have larger insulin-requiring needs. The second piece of your question was regarding the Bluetooth technology, and this benefit for compliance. I would say we absolutely are looking at that as a potential way to offer CGM integration and other integration and data management for the patient. So both of those will be leveraged. I guess the Bluetooth will be leveraged, as the larger volume will be gone after in a different way. Ryan Blicker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. And on that concentrated insulin point, with the Eli Lilly agreement I think you're referencing, can you give us an update on progress there and how we should be thinking about that over the next 12 to 24 months? Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. I think the good news there is that Lilly just enrolled their first patient this month. So that clinical trial is on track and on progress. The majority of that trial is basically being run by Lilly because it requires the recruitment of patients, and we are on track with that and very excited about bringing that opportunity to market. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew of William Blair. Your line is open. Benjamin C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking the question. Just one follow-up to the Bluetooth question, Pat. What does it take from a manufacturing standpoint to incorporate a Bluetooth chip in, so that you can start to lever comms over to a phone? Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We have the capability in our manufacturing processes to do that with not a lot of change. It's a design change you make to the motherboard of the product, et cetera. But it's \u2013 we have that capability from a manufacturing engineering perspective to do that. Benjamin C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC: Right. So is that something that you can start to push your data to a phone? And what sort of regulatory path would it take for you all to do that and ultimately maybe even control the OmniPod from a phone? Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's something we are clearly evaluating. We have done some \u2013 a fair bit of work on that product concept. I guess it's a little too early for us to comment specifically about that, but we are focused on that. Because that's where the market's going, obviously, right? As Shacey talked about. People want to see \u2013 they don't want to see things on your pump display; they want to see it on their phone. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Suraj Kalia of Northland Securities. Your line is open. Suraj A. Kalia - Northland Securities, Inc.: Good afternoon,, everyone. Congratulations on a great quarter. Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Suraj A. Kalia - Northland Securities, Inc.: Patrick, let me start out with you for the first question. And I'm just \u2013 Patrick, SG&A right now is around 48% of sales. And what I'm trying to understand is, there was some mention about patient retention on the back end. Is the issue more about capturing the incremental patient, or is it more about patient retention? I guess where I'm headed is, given where SG&A is, where do you think the levers are, on the front end or the back end, to squeeze out a few more bps on the SG&A line-item? Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I would say in terms of the importance of your existing installed base of patients versus new patient starts, both are important. I think what you need to do is to gain new patients through your efforts in new patient starts. And I think Shacey, as she describes, the team's doing a great job with that. But once those people get on the product, it's also very important to retain them. And the more patients you can retain over time, you can continue to grow your installed base and provide the technology to everyone, not only the new patient starts but the installed base. So both efforts and activities are very important to the long-term, sustainable business that we are developing here. In terms of the bps, Mike speaks in bps. I don't speak in bps. Michael L. Levitz - Chief Financial Officer : This is Mike. I'll just add a few comments to that. So we have talked about the investments that we have been making in the commercial organization related to both of those items. One being the sales force and the support in clinical around new patient starts. Because the new patient starts we add each year \u2013 I mean, this is driving \u2013 not a one-time benefit for us but a multiple-year benefit, as people stay on the product. So each new patient start has a tremendous amount of value if we can retain them. That said, new patient starts represent just still a small part of our installed base in any given period. So retaining that installed base and having those folks continue on the product has a dramatic impact on the bottom line and the top line, and really about us achieving our mission. So, I think, we are investing in both of them because, in terms of our drive towards not just top-line growth but overall growth in the bottom line, reaching new patients and retaining those patients, it's a critical part of what we're trying to do. Suraj A. Kalia - Northland Securities, Inc.: Fair enough. And Patrick, you have assembled a team together that initially, when you all came on board, there was some level of criticism that there was lack of diabetes experience. The numbers certainly suggest that you guys have put those doubts to rest. I guess Patrick, now that you have approximately three quarters under your belt, are you in a position to say, you know what? As an outsider, for me the key issues I saw \u2013 let's say predominantly they were quality control, or patient retention and clinician training, or \u2013 what have you, so far, identified that was missing? And the reason I ask is, just trying to see the sustainability of the current trajectory. Thank you for taking my questions. Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I would say that there was some criticism of bringing in a team that didn't have a lot \u2013 diabetes experience. I would counter that argument by saying that if you look at insulin in its totality, we have got great and deep customer \u2013 or diabetes experience with our CSNs in the field that are talking to diabetes clinicians. Each and every day we have a medical director that's a well-known and regarded endocrinologist, Howard Zisser. And even to the board of directors; one of our directors is from the Joslin Clinic. But what I have brought in here, I think, is a winning and organized group of people that have very high standards of performance, that focus on the right things and drive execution to perform and to provide long-term, sustainable growth. So that's our strategy. That's the people that we brought in place, and I think from my perspective, you can take it to the bank that this is \u2013 the trajectory that we are on is one that we are going to continue to drive for, now and into the future. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Jan Wald of Benchmark Company. Your line is open. Jan D. Wald - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the call, and congratulations on what looks to be an excellent quarter. I guess I have a couple of questions left. On the drug delivery programs that you have, you mention that you now have at least two configurations for the devices that you're going to sell into that business. Do you see those as being the primary ones, or is this kind of a special-purpose thing that you are going to have to do for each customer as you go forward? In other words, I guess, do you have a platform or a couple of platforms that you are going to be able to use in this business? Or is it a special-purpose device every time you have a new customer? Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think the overall platform to think about is the basic OmniPod platform, which is a disposable patch pump that's very easy for the patient to apply and to wear over a period of one, two or three days. So that's kind of the overall platform that we think about. But for each of these drug delivery opportunities, there will be some level of customization required. And I'll go back to our Amgen agreement and our product that we provide to Amgen to deliver Neulasta. Again, that looks very much like the OmniPod product that's used to deliver insulin. But it's customized; it delivers, after a certain interval of time, after it's been administered to the patient, it delivers the drug over a specified interval of time, a certain volume is administered. And then the device shuts down and alarms and tells the patient they're done. So there's that level of customization that we see is likely in each of these opportunities that we have at hand. Jan D. Wald - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Okay. I guess my question was, now you have a large bolus, you have a smaller bolus. Is that \u2013 I guess, one of the things is, from a cost perspective and from your gross margin perspective, the less number of platforms you have that you can modify in the way that you were just talking about, the better. And I guess what I hear you saying is that the OmniPod is the thing you are modifying; that's the base from which you are modifying all the time, I guess. Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's correct, yes. Jan D. Wald - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Is that the right way to think about it? Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. If you look at the larger-volume product that we just unveiled this past week, that looks very much like the original OmniPod System. Operator : And this concludes today question-and-answer \u2013 pardon me, just one moment. We are going to have one more question from the line of Tao Levy of Wedbush. Your line is open. Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you for allow me to follow up. So, just two quick clarifications. One, the recall that took place, is that going to have any impact in your revenues for the fourth quarter? Michael L. Levitz - Chief Financial Officer : This is Mike. You're referring to the July product recall? No. Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Yeah, the charges that you were taking. And I think, wasn't there something that happened in September? Michael L. Levitz - Chief Financial Officer : The July product... Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The field safety notification that you talked about, the product... Michael L. Levitz - Chief Financial Officer : Oh, in terms of the impact on revenues, no, it will not have an impact on revenues. There will be an impact on cost of goods sold, or cost of revenue... Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: ...but not on revenues? Michael L. Levitz - Chief Financial Officer : ...but not on revenues. There's about $1 million of products that we are reserving that were procured in October, in the beginning of the fourth quarter. And therefore, as we reserve it, that ends up being a fourth-quarter charge, as opposed to the third quarter. But there will not be an impact to revenue. Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then just last question. Maybe it would be helpful, and I don't know if you can provide this, but any sense in terms of the amount of inventory level that a large pharma company selling a biologic would want to carry? I don't want to mention any names, any pharma names. So maybe you can answer it that way. A year's worth of inventory? Is that what they are comfortable with? Is it six months? Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think you need to ask them. That's not our area of expertise. The pharma companies are the folks that manage their inventory. It's obvious that they have a large pipeline that they need to fill when they launch a new pharmaceutical product, so there's significant inventory requirements to get that pipeline, that distribution channel full, in order to launch the product. So, each of these agreements, when they become commercial reality, will require stocking to take place. But again, I'd refer you to the pharma companies to get a better sense for the magnitude of that. I will continue to come back to the fact that we started at zero in February, and today we are at 19% conversion of the doses of Neulasta administered in the United States. It's a terrific trajectory that we're on, and we see that continuing going into the future. Operator : And this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I now turn the call back over to Pat Sullivan for closing remarks. Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, operator. Before we conclude today's call, I'd like to publicly congratulate the Insulet commercial team for their spectacular performance this quarter. For the marketing team who put together a great customer-driven marketing messages and programs, the sales team who executed to deliver a record third-quarter new patient starts, and the clinical services team who put together an outstanding diabetes training and support for all of our customers. You guys are on a roll. Keep up the good work, and thank you for a job well done. Thank you, operator. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day. You may all now disconnect.",

LLC Operator : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Insulet Corporation's Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President- Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Deborah R. Gordon - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Communications : Thank you, Liliana. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2015 earnings call. Joining me today are Patrick Sullivan, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Shacey Petrovic, President of Insulet Diabetes Products; Michael Levitz, Chief Financial Officer; and Dan Levangie, President, Insulet Drug Delivery. The replay of this call will be archived on our website. Our press release discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results and first quarter and full year 2016 guidance are also available in the IR section of our website. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to be materially different from any future results implied by such statements. Such factors include those referenced in our Safe Harbor Statement in our fourth quarter earnings release, and in the company's filings with the SEC. With that, let me turn the call over to Pat. Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Deb. And good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll start off today's call with a brief review of our performance and our view of the business and our market opportunities today. Following my remarks, Mike will review our financial results in more detail and discuss our outlook for 2016, and then Shacey will provide an update on our commercial progress before we turn the call over for questions. 2015 was a year of dramatically improved performance and significant accomplishments, specifically our fourth quarter revenue and full year 2015 revenue results, the recently announced sale of Neighborhood Diabetes business, the team's continued progress on our key commercial initiatives, our recently announced partnerships with Glooko and Eli Lilly, our Digital Insulet strategy on our path to the artificial pancreas product offering and the dramatic growth in our Drug Delivery business. We've made significant strides in our key areas of focus during 2015 and as we enter 2016, our momentum is stronger than ever. I remain tremendously excited about our business and the market opportunities and continue to be confident that we have the right products, a winning strategy and a really energized team that has positioned the company for long-term sustainable and profitable growth. In the fourth quarter, all four of our product lines once again grew year-over-year revenue and our results exceeded expectations. Fourth quarter revenue was just over $100 million and grew 38% year-over-year, $9 million higher than the midpoint of our guidance range. And for the year, we generated revenue of $324 million, a 12% increase compared to 2014. We again set a number of performance records within our U.S. OmniPod business. Our fourth quarter U.S. OmniPod revenue reached a record of $53 million, representing year-over-year growth of 21%. New patient starts in the U.S. during the quarter were up just over 20% year-over-year, representing the highest number of patient starts in the company's history. In addition, new patient starts within the pediatric population in the United States were up approximately 30% year-over-year, also hitting another all-time high. And as you know, these new patient starts are an early indicator of revenue growth in \u2013 the revenue growth in our recurring revenue model and these growth rates set us up for continuing strong revenue growth going into 2016. Our International OmniPod business also delivered strong growth with revenue up 16% year-over-year to a record of over $15 million. The results from our Drug Delivery business are very strong with fourth quarter revenue of nearly $15 million. As you know, a large portion of our Drug Delivery business includes sales to Amgen and last month, they reported that the sales of the Neulasta Onpro kit, which includes our OmniPod technology, continues to gain adoption and after only one year on the market achieved approximately 25% share of the Neulasta doses in the United States. We are thrilled with our Drug Delivery results and our relationships we have with both of our existing commercial partners, as well as all of our other Drug Delivery partners. Finally our Neighborhood Diabetes business generated revenue of just over $17 million in the fourth quarter. The recent sale of Neighborhood Diabetes to Liberty Medical enables us to focus our operational and financial resources on driving accelerated growth of our innovative OmniPod and Drug Delivery products. Liberty Medical is positioned to make investments in Neighborhood to further develop and scale their business. Divesting Neighborhood Diabetes also improves our overall company revenue growth rate and gross margin profile. I'd like to thank the Neighborhood employees for their hard work and commitment to Insulet, and wish them continued success as part of Liberty. I'd like to now make a few organizational announcements that we're making here. First, Shacey Petrovic will assume the role of President, Insulet Diabetes Products. Shacey joined us a year ago as Chief Commercial Officer and led the realignment of our commercial operations, including sales, marketing, managed care, customer care, international and strategic partnerships. Under her leadership, Insulet achieved record-breaking commercial results, reset the product development roadmap and established and energized a collaborative culture. Second, I'd like to also welcome Chuck Alpuche who joined us earlier this month as Senior Vice President of Global Manufacturing and Operations. Chuck is a senior PepsiCo veteran and comes to our organization with more than 30 years of global manufacturing operations and engineering experience. Chuck had responsibility for the international supply chain for PepsiCo, with responsibility for over 300 plants and has made over 120 trips to China. We're thrilled to have Chuck onboard and we are confident that his extensive operational expertise will be extremely viable in helping us refine our global manufacturing footprint, and identify opportunities to significantly improve manufacturing operations and supply chain effectiveness. This is one of the many steps we are taking across the organization to achieve operational excellence, and to ensure we achieve profitability in the near term. Before I'd turn the call over to Mike, I like to speak briefly about what we believe is the tremendous market opportunity before us, and the importance of the OmniPod, elegant and differentiated insulin delivery system. Diabetes is a growing global epidemic. There are 20 million people worldwide living with type 1 diabetes. Most are managing with multiple daily injections, with their lives depending on navigating the minefield of carb counting, skin pricks, injecting themselves or their children and challenging unpredictable blood glucose levels. These patients, particularly if they are not well controlled, have alarming rates of comorbidities like blindness, heart disease and a higher rate of death. We are convinced that the OmniPod is the best insulin delivery system available to help these patients improve their glycemic control and significantly improve their quality of life, live longer and healthier lives. In addition to the large population of type 1 diabetes patients, the incidence of type 2 diabetes towards that of type 1 was a substantial subset of type 2 patients requiring administration of daily insulin to survive. These people typically require more insulin than the average type 1 patient and many would benefit from the OmniPod if they could hold more units of insulin in their existing OmniPod reservoir. We're partnered with Eli Lilly to complete development and clinical work to obtain regulatory approval for use of their concentrated insulins, U200 and U500 in our OmniPod, which would effectively increase the capacity of the OmniPod reservoir. This will ensure that all people living with insulin-dependent diabetes, regardless of their daily insulin dose requirements, can experience the freedom and proved glycemic control the OmniPod provides. As Mike and Shacey will discuss in detail, we look forward to a very exciting 2016 of key initiatives in full swing and revenue that we expect to grow by approximately 30% compared to 2015. We are growing \u2013 we are highly focused on maximizing the future potential of our OmniPod technology, and our senior leadership team is executing our winning strategy. And our commercial team are developing \u2013 delivering very strong results. I am very pleased with the momentum we see in our diabetes and drug delivery business opportunities and I'm confident we have the right foundation in place to enable the company to deliver long-term sustainable profitable growth. I'll now turn the call over to Mike. Michael L. Levitz - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you, Pat. I'll first review our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results and then introduce our 2016 guidance. Please note that our 2015 results include Neighborhood Diabetes. However, effective January 1, 2016, the Neighborhood results will no longer be included in our continuing operation, and our forward-looking guidance will reflect this change. To assist you with your modeling and for clearer year-over-year comparisons, we've provided pro forma 2015 financial statements in our earnings release, which exclude the Neighborhood business as if they were divested on January 1 of last year. In addition, we have posted to our website a schedule of the pro-forma revenue for each quarter of 2015 reflecting this divestiture. Please also note that as I review our results, unless otherwise stated, all of the commentary regarding changes will be on a year-over-year basis. We are very pleased to report fourth-quarter revenue growth of 38%, with revenue reaching over $100 million in the quarter, compared to $72.5 million. We saw growth across all of our product lines and the primary growth drivers were the over 20% growth in U.S. OmniPod sales and the significant growth of our Drug Delivery business, which delivered revenue approaching $14 million in the quarter from less than $1 million one year ago. This brought our full year 2015 revenue to just over $324 million, an increase of 12%, even with the low shipments in the first half of 2015, as our OmniPod distributors significantly reduced their inventories to steady-state levels from their higher inventory levels in 2014. Our reported gross margin in the fourth quarter was 45%. This is five points lower than the same period last year, and primarily reflects costs directly and indirectly attributable to the voluntary Field Safety Notification we discussed with you in detail last quarter. The decrease also reflects our increased investment in product quality and related policies and procedures that stand behind our products. For the full year, our reported gross margin was 46%, that's approximately four points lower than 2014 due to the costs I just described related to the Field Safety Notification, as well as additional scrap costs we described to you in the first half of this year. Excluding these items, our adjusted gross margin for the year was in line with our expectations of approximately 50%. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $69.4 million and just under $209 million for the full year. The fourth quarter expenses included approximately $12 million non-recurring expenses, of which $9 million represented a non-cash impairment charge associated with the sale of Neighborhood. Excluding these items, operating expenses were directly in line with our expectations of $195 million to $200 million for the full year 2015. And we ended the year with a cash balance of almost $122 million. Let me now walk you through our outlook for 2016. We are extremely pleased with our revenue growth in 2015 and our 2016 revenue guidance reflects our expectation of continued strong growth in the coming year. For the full year of 2016, we anticipate revenues will be in the range of $330 million to $350 million, compared to pro forma 2015 revenue of $264 million. At the midpoint, this represents growth of approximately 30%. We expect the strong revenue growth will be driven by U.S. OmniPod growth in the mid-teens on a percentage basis, International OmniPod growth of approximately 50% and Drug Delivery growth of approximately 75%. The percentage growth in International is higher than historic and expected future trends due to a lower base for comparison resulting from reductions in distributor inventory in the first half of 2015. For the first quarter of 2016, we expect revenue in the range of $77 million to $80 million, compared to pro forma first quarter 2015 revenue of $48 million. That represents growth of approximately 65% at the midpoint. We expect strong U.S. OmniPod revenue growth of approximately 25% for the quarter. We expect our International revenue to be in the range of $13 million to $15 million, which represents strong year-over-year growth even excluding the favorable comparable. On the Drug Delivery side, we expect revenue of approximately $15 million, up significantly from last year, due largely to the strong adoption of our Pod for Amgen's Neulasta drug for cancer treatment. We expect our 2016 gross margin to improve to the low-to-mid-50% range. We expect 2016 to be a year of significant commercial success in revenue growth, gross margin improvement and continued investment in building our foundation for long-term growth and profitability. With the sale of Neighborhood Diabetes earlier this month, we will record additional charges in the first quarter related to the divestiture. My comments regarding profitability exclude any such non-recurring items. In 2016, we plan to continue our ramped up R&D investments in the areas that Shacey will share with you shortly. Even with these strategic investments in our future, we expect to improve our operating leverage in 2016. Looking beyond 2016, we continue to target gross margins to 60% or higher over the next few years and expect improving operating leverage, based on the timing of our development initiatives, our expanded field sales force reaching their full productivity, and as we begin to leverage the strong foundation that we've been building in support of our continued growth objectives. As such, we plan to deliver positive EBIT in 2018 and significant improved profitability over the longer term. In summary, we are very pleased with our successes in 2015. We believe strongly in the long-term growth and profitability of our business and we are excited about the opportunities to leverage our unique offerings with OmniPod and Drug Delivery to drive significant value for our shareholders, and make a real difference in quality of life for patients that use our products. I will now turn the call over to Shacey. Shacey Petrovic - President-Insulet Diabetes Products : Thanks, Mike. 2015 has been a year of tremendous progress here at Insulet. We have an enormous market opportunity that we have been successfully converting through improved commercial execution, our laser-beam \u2013 and our laser-beam focus on new patient retention with terrific results. Also, we've defined and launched an exciting product development roadmap internally claimed Digital Insulet. This is paving the way for innovative mobile capabilities and putting Insulet in the vanguard of research, development and commercialization of an artificial pancreas. These efforts have resulted in a quarter \u2013 another quarter and ultimately a year of record revenue and new patients starts, early progress toward improved patient retention, along with exciting tangible headway on the longer-term strategic roadmap. First, I'll touch on our market opportunity, and how we're converting the market through first-rate commercial execution, robust clinical differentiation and improved market access. OmniPod has many advantages over tube pumps. The improved freedom and quality of life, the glycemic control that users get, because they don't need to disconnect from their insulin and its ease of use over other delivery methods. And given these significant advantages, we are convinced that OmniPod should command a larger share of the pump market. But our true opportunity is much larger than the pump market; in fact it's three times as large. It represents the population of patients today that rely on multiple daily injections. This is more than 2 million people living with type 1 diabetes and insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes in the U.S. alone. It's a $6 billion domestic market opportunity and likely more than double that internationally. Today, this is the population of patients from which more than 70% of our new users come. And more than half of these users tell us that they would not convert to pump therapy if they had to be tethered to a conventional pump. That is extraordinary. The majority of our new users tell us that they would not have converted to a pump if it hadn't been for OmniPod. Our investment in increasing the footprint of our sales force has driven an expansion in our prescriber base and also improved utilization among our targeted accounts. Our sales reps and field clinicians are doing a great job, building awareness and advocacy of OmniPod unique advantages, through a focus on improved clinical outcomes and quality of life associated with OmniPod. We also made impressive progress on our goal to clearly differentiate OmniPod through robust clinical data. As of the start of this year, we had submitted six abstracts or conference presentations and three manuscripts for publication. These clinicals demonstrate OmniPod's positive impact on glycemic control, quality of life and other key benefits and we're not stopping here. In 2016, we will deliver these publications and continue to grow the body of evidence that demonstrates that OmniPod is the best delivery system for people living with insulin-dependent diabetes and that OmniPod is the best platform for future innovations. In Q4, we also expanded our market access team, with a focus on improving access for our U.S. patients. We believe it is important to demonstrate OmniPod's value proposition for payers and our new market access team is doing just that, using compelling data and the healthcare economic model that we developed last quarter. The early efforts of this team paid off in 2015 with expanded Medicaid coverage in New Jersey, in Texas and in managed Medicaid access in Florida. Great execution across sales, market access, marketing and customer care drove the record new patient starts and record revenue that we reported for Q4 and the full year. We've also remained laser-focused on patient retention for our new users, by providing new and significantly improved programs, resources and support. And now with the recent launch of Insulet Provided Glooko, we provide them with a best-in-class data management system. Our customer demand for Insulet-provided Glooko has exceeded our expectations and this new solution is really opening the door for many accounts that were previously reluctant to proactively offer OmniPod. It's also providing a vehicle for accounts to identify more patients who could benefit from OmniPod. These retention efforts have paid off and by the end of the year, we significantly improved our new patient retention rates. We're not resting here, our active OmniPod users are precious to us and we want to ensure that we give all users, not just our new users, a best-in-class experience. In 2016, we will take our learnings from our new patient retention program and expand our efforts to positively impact our entire OmniPod customer base. One of the primary drivers for existing user retention is product quality or reliability. And in 2015, we made great progress. Our customer experience and the quality and reliability of OmniPod have never been better. But we know that here our work is never done and in 2016, we will continue to raise the bar for our customers. Our customer care team drove meaningful improvements in 2015. This meant that we answered our customer's calls more quickly. We significantly reduced the turnaround time from patient referral to product shipment. We delivered an enquiring patients benefit investigation much more rapidly. And ultimately, we improved our conversion rate from qualified leads to new patients. We spent the last year analyzing our customer base, particularly in the United States, in an effort to provide a more accurate assessment of our OmniPod installed base, and for us to gain insight into customer behaviors and opportunities for us to provide the best possible support. As you know or many of you know, this can be challenging, because about 40% of our U.S. users obtained their OmniPod through a third-party distributor. And throughout the year, patients will change distributors based on insurance plans or other factors. Taking all of this into consideration, we estimate our worldwide installed base was approximately 85,000 users at the end of 2015, with just over two-thirds being U.S. customers. This is an increase of approximately 15,000 customers over the installed base at the end of 2014. Please note that our installed base estimate for 2014 has been revised and at the end of 2014, we now believe we had 70,000 users with approximately 70% being in the United States. As always, this is directional in nature, primarily because we have a little less insight into the distributor component of our customer base. We are very pleased with the 20% plus growth in our worldwide installed base in 2015 and we expect this trend to continue on an annual basis for 2016. Rather than provide specific growth metrics on a quarterly basis, we'll give you quarterly updates and color on how we're progressing towards this annual view. Finally, I am thrilled with how our team is refining and executing on our product development roadmap. With the recently announced expansion of our concentrated insulin development program with Lilly, we will effectively double the reservoir capacity of the pod, with no changes to the form factor that everyone loves. And with concentrated insulins in our pod, we double the size of our addressable market. U200 and U500 enable OmniPod to help more people living with insulin-dependent diabetes with a three-day pod change. Our U500 program is on track with approximately a third of patients enrolled in the study plan to wrap this year and U200 is off to the races. Our current plan has both of these hitting the market in the next two years to three years. We've also made great progress on our artificial pancreas program. Insulet will lead a transition to digital and we will launch the most differentiated, innovative artificial pancreas system to the market. OmniPod's tubeless platform, automated cannula insertion and the potential to migrate the functionality of our handheld PDM through a phone are our really true differentiators that will position Insulet to deliver the most unique AP product on the market. We have completed comprehensive market research that clearly and enthusiastically showed us that our customers want fewer devices to carry around. They want more capability on their mobile phone and they are frustrated by the obsolescence of CGM integration that they've seen with other pump companies in our space. As a result, over the last several months, we built internal capabilities and we've worked closely with partners such as Dexcom, Glooko and others to rethink our next-gen PDM program and to prioritize our mobile digital strategy. Thanks to these efforts, we will be launching our first patient app in the first half of this year. This app will enable patients to order products, access training resources and is really designed to continue to enhance our OmniPod user experience. In addition, later this year we will submit a 510(k) for our Bluetooth PDM and mobile app that will display key real-time data on a customer's mobile device, including CGM integration with Dexcom's G5 sensor. In fact, this will enable CGM integration in a manner that ensures that our users will always have the latest and greatest CGM sensor with the latest and greatest OmniPod. In 2015 and particularly in Q4, we took significant steps in the development of our artificial pancreas device and program, including a pre-submission meeting with the FDA, the completion of our clinical and product development roadmap and the selection of our algorithm partner. We are thrilled to announce that we've entered into an agreement with Mode AGC to license what we feel is the most robust artificial pancreas algorithm available. The algorithm is based on over two decades of clinical research conducted at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Frank Doyle, one of the algorithm's inventors, recently appointed Dean of Harvard's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences will continue to serve as advisor to Insulet as we collaborate to commercialize our system. We've spent the better part of last year incorporating the algorithm into our unique platform and we expect to be in clinical trials later on this year. We are working diligently to bring a truly differentiated, artificial pancreas system to the market that will help us make good on our mission to make diabetes a smaller part of patients' lives. While our team is pleased with the Q4 revenue performance and our success growing our installed base with record new patient starts, we really are just getting started. The progress we made this year on our strategic roadmap will ensure that we continue to deliver our best-in-class customer experience, that we drive significant conversion of this enormous market opportunity, and that Insulet leads our market with an exciting digital strategy, paving the way for innovative mobile capabilities and a groundbreaking artificial pancreas system. 2015 was a great year here at Insulet and 2016 is on pace to be even more exciting. I'll now turn the call back to Pat. Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Shacey. With that operator, let's open the call up for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Brooks West of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Unknown Speaker : Hey, guys this is Tom (28:12) on for Brooks. Congrats on a great quarter. Shacey Petrovic - President-Insulet Diabetes Products : Thanks. Unknown Speaker : So, two quick questions if I may. And the first one, I was hoping you could maybe talk about utilization just in the U.S. diabetes business. And maybe how the impact is being felt in patients just from the focus on quality control and the manufacturing process. And if you're seeing any kind of difference in reorder rates or maybe a little bit higher utilization from that. Shacey Petrovic - President-Insulet Diabetes Products : Sure. Tom (28:54), this is Shacey. I haven't seen differences in utilization rates that are material this year in 2015. We have seen in new patients as I mentioned a higher reorder or retention rate. But in our total patient data, the utilization rates remain pretty steady. Unknown Speaker : Okay, great. And then just one quick follow up. There was an announcement from one of your major partners in the Drug Delivery business, that they announced an agreement with another manufacturer of on-body devices for drug delivery (29:19)? Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Dan, would you like to take that one? Daniel J. Levangie - President-Drug Delivery Division : Yeah. Sure. I'm not sure I heard the end of the question. Could you repeat the question? My line broke up. Shacey Petrovic - President-Insulet Diabetes Products : I think we may have lost Tom (29:47). Daniel J. Levangie - President-Drug Delivery Division : Okay. Well, I mean \u2013 I think the question was related to the announcement by Amgen with respect to Unilife. And here's what I'd say about that. And \u2013 in my mind \u2013 in our mind, Amgen is doing what it needs to do for its business, it's evaluating technology. It's a technology leader as a company, and the interesting thing is the overwhelming majority of drugs that are manufactured by Amgen are delivered by devices. And so, I think this is just an example of Amgen being Amgen and evaluating technology that's out there. As it relates to our agreement with Amgen on the Onpro kit for Neulasta, it really has no impact on that relationship, and in fact, our relationship with Amgen continues to strengthen. This \u2013 just this quarter, we launched a new engagement team model, where we've got teams from both companies that work together very closely \u2013 on a monthly basis they're in contact. And every quarter, we have a multi-day business review meeting that really ties the two teams together and develops our strategy for going forward. So, I think the announcement by Amgen this week was Amgen being Amgen. Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Dan. Next question, operator. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Tao Levy with Wedbush. Your line is now open. Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Hi, good afternoon. Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi Tao. Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Hi. So I guess, there are two questions. The first one, in your guidance, are you including the recent reimbursement decision out of France in that outlook? Shacey Petrovic - President-Insulet Diabetes Products : Yes. Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. And we started talking about your next generation PDM, the Bluetooth-enabled, how small can that PDM become? If all the display functionality gets transferred onto the smartphone \u2013 on the patient's phone. Do you need much \u2013 or does that PDM need to be as big as it currently is? Shacey Petrovic - President-Insulet Diabetes Products : Yeah. Well, I think Tao, you're asking the same question we're asking and some of that will depend on our conversations with the FDA and how much capability they will enable us to put on the mobile platform, but you're thinking the way that we're thinking about it. That we can make the mobile environment more and more rich and sort of feature-up the app and then be able to feature-down the PDM. We know that patients interact with their phones every minute and that they don't want to take their pump off their waist or go searching for their PDM. So, our goal is to make them less \u2013 or I guess enable them to be less and less reliant on that PDM, but we don't have a sense today exactly of all of the capabilities that we'll be able to put on the mobile app. We are having those discussions with the FDA today. Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot and congrats on a good quarter. Shacey Petrovic - President-Insulet Diabetes Products : Thank you. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Michael Weinstein from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Robbie J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. This is Robbie in for Mike. Congrats on the good quarter. Unknown Speaker : Thanks. Robbie J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I wanted to maybe touch on the Drug Delivery business, because that number came in well above not only the Street's number, but also your guidance and what IMS scripts are pointing to if you do the math off of what on-body sales are and how much you get per pod. So, can you help us fill in the gap? Are you maybe getting a different ASP than the 70% to 75% \u2013 $70 to $75 per pod you talked about in the past. And is that changing next year at all? Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Danny, do you hear that question? Daniel J. Levangie - President-Drug Delivery Division : Yeah. I got that. First of all, I don't know that we've confirmed any price on the \u2013 to our partner Amgen and would not want to do that, number one. Number two, I just think, the revenue is a reflection of the increased uptake of the product at the \u2013 in the month of December, I think the conversion rate was roughly 27%. So, we're feeling really good about the adoption rate of the product in the marketplace, and I think the revenues are a reflection of that. Robbie J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. So, you would say, there is not a lot of stocking in that number, that it's a true reflection of commercial sales? Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, I didn't say that \u2013 as we've said in the past, we build product and ship product to a forecast that's provided to us by our partner. We don't have a specific visibility into end-user used versus what's stocking. Some of it is obviously stocking. But I think, if you need more information on that, I'd direct you to Amgen. Robbie J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then, maybe turning to your comments about EBIT positive in 2018, that was great to get a timeline. I want to see, one, is that EBIT positive in the insulin business as well or for the company as a whole? And what level of sales do you need to get to for your insulin business to be EBIT positive? And is, can you get there with what you have now in the Insulet framework or do you need to add on to that as well? Michael L. Levitz - Chief Financial Officer : Robbie. This is Mike. First of all, we only run our business as one business. So, any comments we make about EBIT or profitability are purely related to that. We share resources across our business and make strategic decisions in that fashion. So, what we talked about in terms of the EBIT guidance, I talked about improved gross margins. We've made significant investments in our product, performance and our team. We've seen the commercial success that we've talked about and where Shacey talked about the strong growth, that we're seeing across the business, (36:17). So, all of those things together, the revenue growth, the improvement in gross margins and the ability to leverage our operating foundation that we've been building. I mean, we've been talking about the fact that we've been building it now because, we believe in the future of the company. And the improved operating performance purely reflects that. Robbie J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Appreciate it. Thanks again. Michael L. Levitz - Chief Financial Officer : Sure. Operator : And our next question is from the line of James Francescone with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. James Francescone - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, thanks for taking the question guys. I wanted to touch on gross margin first. If you look at the gross margin in the quarter 45%, obviously down from last year and down from where you've been early in the year. I understand there are some issues, in terms of the product field action and the investments that you're continuing to make in quality. But we maybe would have expected a little bit stronger gross margin number given the upside in Drug Delivery, which you've described as meaningfully higher than the corporate average. So, can you help us maybe quantify a bit some of the puts and takes that were \u2013 that were working against you on the gross margin line in the quarter? Michael L. Levitz - Chief Financial Officer : Sure. This is Mike. As I said a few moments ago, the principal thing was related to the Field Safety Notification, and there were \u2013 the direct costs and there were indirect costs of that. We scrapped a significant amount of inventory at a time when we had \u2013 and we're seeing in the future dramatic demand. And so, ramping up our supply chain manufacturing from a standstill there, created some additional inefficiencies in the quarter. And those continue a bit into the beginning of 2016, but we're really pleased with the progress that we've made, and now we feel very confident of where we are, and you can see that reflected in our gross margin expectations for this year of low-to-mid 50s. So, yeah, there were some challenges in the fourth quarter. They were principally related to the Field Safety Notification that we \u2013 that we did and we talked about in the past. But I think we have a \u2013 we have a very bright future ahead of us and we're making, we talked about the introduction of a new leader in manufacturing operations, where we're placing a lot of resources there, because we really believe in this product and we want to strengthen our not only product quality, but our ability to leverage the cost of that product. James Francescone - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Got it. And then second, just on international guidance. The guidance implies, you're doing kind of $13 million, $14 million, $15 million a quarter in the back half of the year \u2013 sorry, back half of 2015. The guidance seems to imply that \u2013 that run rate of $14 million, $15 million a quarter is going to be about the same run rate that you're looking for in 2016 as well. So, I mean how do we think about that in light of the new territories that are coming online, and the underlying growth of that business? I mean, is that a conservative outlook, or is there something else that's kind of working against growth there where sequential trends would be kind of more flattish is you're guiding? Michael L. Levitz - Chief Financial Officer : This is Mike again. I guess, I see us providing some pretty strong growth, we're talking about growing that business at approximately 50% year-over-year. So, there is a significant amount of growth built into this plan. So, we'll continue to give guidance as we go through the year. I would not say that our guidance is overly conservative or overly aggressive. We want to give you a plan that we believe in, and that we stand behind. But, is there upside to this plan? Absolutely. But, negative things can happen too, and that's why we give guidance with the best information we have available, but there aren't any major headwinds or roadblocks that we're concerned about, in fact, we're very excited, I mean being able to deliver 50% growth in that business, I think is tremendous, and reflect our excitement about that space. Shacey Petrovic - President-Insulet Diabetes Products : And James, it may be helpful to know that any new country within the scope of \u2013 Insulet's (40:25) business for example, is going to be relatively small contributing to the whole. So these new countries while they're just getting started over the course of 2016 are going to be relatively smaller contributors. James Francescone - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Well, thanks for taking the questions. And congrats on some great numbers. Shacey Petrovic - President-Insulet Diabetes Products : Thanks. Michael L. Levitz - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Unknown Speaker : Hello, good afternoon. This is Mike (40:51) calling in for Jayson. Thank you for taking the questions. First thing I wanted to ask about was the artificial pancreas development. Just logistically, the new algorithm, where does that sit within the product? Is it within the smartphone app, is it within the pod, is it in the PDM? So, where is that captured? And then, I know you're conducting first-in-man trials this year, but when do you begin a pivotal? And then lastly, based on your conversations with the FDA, do you think you can start with a basal management product or do you need to start with predictive low-glucose suspend before you can get into basal management. Shacey Petrovic - President-Insulet Diabetes Products : So, those are all great questions, Mike (41:32). So let me see if I can take them one at a time. I think, the first one was about where the algorithm resides. And the algorithm will reside partially in the pod and partially in the cloud. That's the way that this system is designed today and were intended to be designed today. The second question I think was about when we'll be in pivotal. So, we will be in on-body trials later today and \u2013 or, I mean, later this year and we intend to be in a pivotal in sometime in 2017, probably towards the end of that year. And then, I think the last question was regarding how much capability the FDA will support incorporating into our first system as opposed to that step-wise approach. And \u2013 again, we're \u2013 we've had one pre-step meeting with the FDA, which will probably be one of many, but our intention is to offer more than predictive low-glucose suspend and they supported that proposal. Unknown Speaker : Okay. Very helpful. And then, just a quickie. Any new commercial agreements for the Drug Delivery business signed in the fourth quarter and any other revenue streams that might be new that are assumed in the 2016 guidance? Daniel J. Levangie - President-Drug Delivery Division : Yeah. We continue to have the sixth ongoing development agreement we've talked about in the past. We didn't add any new ones in the quarter. And there is no new commercial revenue generating arrangements in place in the guidance for 2016. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Danielle Antalffy, Junior, with Leerrink Partners. Your line is now open. Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC : Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. And I didn't know I had a senior, so that's interesting. But, congrats on a great quarter. I was wondering Shacey, if you could follow up on some of the commentary around the Glooko partnership and what would it take for FDA to get comfortable with allowing only the iPhone for insulin data? How far off are we \u2013 do you think we'll ever get there? And what gets us there? Shacey Petrovic - President-Insulet Diabetes Products : Okay. Danielle, thanks. I think \u2013 so, the first question regarding Glooko, as I mentioned, we're really excited with the early launch of that product. We were in a sort of limited market release with it, sometime in December. And we knew that customers were going to really appreciate the improved data management, the retrospective analysis and some of the better tools and insight that it gives to both patients and secure teams to enable them to make better decisions regarding their diabetes care. But in fact, we were kind of blown away by the demand as we got out into full market release, and we are rolling this out much faster than we anticipated. And what we see, our kind of two big advantages, our previous data management system was probably not as \u2013 it was not very competitive, in terms of features and it's provided some technical challenges to our accounts. And so, this certainly has addressed all of those concerns and then offered improved reporting, improved ease of use and improved insights. And what that means is that there were accounts that were not proactively offering OmniPod, because of the challenges associated with our previous data management system. And now they are proactively offering OmniPod. And then in accounts where they were offering OmniPod and Glooko is giving them some tools to identify patients who could benefit from better glycemic control with OmniPod. And so, it's really doing both things, helping us go deeper and helping us go into more accounts, which is really exciting. And then the other comment or the other question regarding iPhone or a phone control of insulin delivery, and when the FDA will be comfortable with that. I think, it's the million dollar question, I don't really have the answer to that, except to say that in our early discussions regarding the artificial pancreas and our desire to sort of move more and more capability to the phone, it struck me that they were much more comfortable with the plan to have a backup PDM. So, I think, I think that they are understanding, as we are, what our patients want, in terms of more and more functionality on their phone. But of course there are safety and security concerns, and a backup PDM really helps resolve some of those concerns. Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC : Right. That does makes sense. And then, just a quick question on Neighborhood, what happens to the OmniPod business that was running through Neighborhood now. Do you guys just bring that back in-house or how does that work? Michael L. Levitz - Chief Financial Officer : Danielle, this is Mike. So, we will continue to sell Neighborhood Diabetes was purchased as you know by Liberty and we know Liberty very well, and we'll continue to sell to those patients through Liberty. What we did to make it easier from a modeling standpoint is we put on our website a breakout of revenue, historically this past year \u2013 as reported and then just so you can compare year-over-year, what it would have been, had we divested Neighborhood at the beginning of the year. And so, you can see the breakout of the OmniPod revenue that went through Neighborhood that will be \u2013 we expect to be part of our continuing business, and that will now be reflected in the U.S. OmniPod line, now it's about $2.8 million in 2015. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Kyle Rose of Canaccord. Your line is now open. Kyle Rose - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Can you hear me, all right? Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Got it. Kyle Rose - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Fantastic. So, I just wanted to see, if we can dig into \u2013 and get a little more color on some of the comments made about improving retention rates and attrition. It sounds like you're making big strides on the new patient retention rates, and you're going to focus in 2016 on transitioning that to some of the existing patients. Just wanted to see, if you could give us a little more color around the improvement that we saw over 2015? What's the breakdown in attrition from a new patient versus an underlying existing patient? I mean, I think that we've used a 9% blend in the past. How should we think about that, and then what were the improvements like over 2015, and how should we think about that improving in 2016? Shacey Petrovic - President-Insulet Diabetes Products : Sure. So, the new patient improvement or the new patient retention rate is actually approximately the same as the whole. We don't really break it out. But we \u2013 it enables us to do sort of a retrospective analysis. So, when we ship a patient products for the first time, we ship them a starter kit, which is 90 days' worth of pods and the PDM. And so, what we started to track with the implementation of our new strategies was the \u2013 how many of these patients placed their second reorder. So, we could start to evaluate that four months after a new patient came on board. And what we saw with the implementation of some of these new strategies and support and programs was that we virtually halved our attrition rate with new patients. So, we really saw a dramatic impact there, but remember that new patients is only ever 10% of our total patient volume in any given time period. So, relative to the whole it's not a huge impact. As we look to 2016, our goal will be to take some of those really effective strategies and then also use our new patient app to really help drive ongoing improved performance, and a lot of that comes from as I said product quality and reliability, which we're doing really great with. And then also just with training, support, ongoing support for those patients and just a better customer experience, and we're working very hard at that also. Kyle Rose - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Okay, great. I appreciate the color there. And then just a follow up on the new patient additions in 2015, just wanted to make sure my math is correct, but you get the two-thirds of the underlying patients \u2013 the global patient base in 2015, and 70% of the underlying patients are based in 2014. I guess \u2013 my math kind of says that implies 8,000 net additions in the U.S. year-over-year in 2015. So, I guess \u2013 one, am I on track with that math? But then two, on the OUS side when you think about 2016 guidance, how much of that 50% growth year-over-year comes from going direct in Canada, and how much of that comes from improved pricing that you'll see from a direct business versus distributor? Michael L. Levitz - Chief Financial Officer : This is Mike. I'll answer that last question first. And maybe turn it over to Shacey for the installed base piece. With regards to Canada, I think we've said in the past and it remains true that of our international revenues, our European distributor represents about 75% of that. And of the remaining 25%, Canada is the most meaningful part of that in \u2013 most of that remaining 25%. So that said, when you look at \u2013 just do the math with that \u2013 Canada, we're excited out being direct there. It's a great business, but it really is a very small part of things and really doesn't move the needle a whole lot frankly relative to our overall trends and guidance. Shacey Petrovic - President-Insulet Diabetes Products : And I think in terms of the installed base, you're, I think, directionally correct. We're a little bit over two-thirds in the U.S. today. You're pretty close. Next question? Operator : And our next question is from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Michael, I wanted to ask a question on gross margins, just so I understand and I'm on the road, so I haven't pulled the restated ex-Neighborhood filings yet. But, I think you were talking about a gross margin in 2016 in the low-to-mid 50% range. Ex-Neighborhood, what was it in 2015? And could you adjust that for us with some of the costs you had that you excluded in 2015, kind of what's the baseline we should be building off of 2015 going into 2016 on the gross margin line ex-Neighborhood? Michael L. Levitz - Chief Financial Officer : Well, this is Mike. So, if \u2013 when you get an opportunity, if you look at the press release, when you're not on the road, the pro forma figures that we've shown here for 2015 would equate to a 50.5% gross margin on a pro forma, that's an unaudited obviously number. But, we wanted to give that indicative of, as you start to look year-over-year. So, I think it's fair to say with our expectations in the low-to-mid 50s that we expect the margins to be definitely better than they were last year, because last year included a number of different manufacturing challenges and write-offs of product. We talked about the Field Safety Notification and some of those other items, and we said they were non-recurring in nature. And so, we believe that to be the case, and so our guidance reflects having a much cleaner view this year and not having some of those same issues. I would love to say there's upside and we are driving to improve our gross margins. And I think that \u2013 and you can tell by our guidance that we expect over the coming years or next few years to be 60%-plus gross margin, that we believe there are some definitely real opportunities there. The challenge if you want to call it that is they don't happen overnight and that's what our guidance reflects for 2016. But, we're really excited about our opportunities for gross margin improvement over the next few years. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Fair enough. And I did see that 50.5% number. I guess my question was does that include the costs \u2013 that 50.5% includes the costs on the Field Safety recall and what have you? Michael L. Levitz - Chief Financial Officer : Yes. The numbers in that table there basically take our reported numbers and the adjustments that are made are to pull out the effect of Neighborhood as if it had been divested. So there were no other adjustments to those figures. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open. Ryan Blicker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. This is Ryan Blicker in for Doug. Thanks for taking my questions. So starting with the U.S. OmniPod business. You obviously had some great patient starts in 2015, as well as some one-time headwinds I would say during the year. Considering how you expect to start out the year in that business and all of the positive qualitative commentary you provided, is there any reason why that business doesn't grow a bit faster than mid-teens in 2016? Michael L. Levitz - Chief Financial Officer : Well, this is Mike. Since I gave the guidance, I'll refer to that. I think that growing mid-teens, we've \u2013 Shacey gave guidance on a number of different commercial areas, including I think 20% growth in \u2013 20%-plus growth in new patient starts again. So, that's to say that we expect continued success commercially, and that's reflected in our guidance. But, the reason we talked about new patient starts more as an indicator of future opportunity and in any one period, they don't represent a significant amount of the revenue impact. And so, mid-teens revenue growth, I think we believe is pretty strong. Are there opportunities to beat those numbers? Sure. There are definitely opportunities to beat that. I mean, I know that our entire team is very excited coming out of last year, and with what we expect for this year, and we believe that's reflected in our guidance. But, there's always challenges that can crop up. And so, when we give guidance, we wanted to be something that we believe reasonable, and would love to do better than that. Ryan Blicker - Cowen & Co. LLC: It's early in the year. Shacey Petrovic - President-Insulet Diabetes Products : Yes. Ryan Blicker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then, just one on Drug Delivery. The full-year guidance seems to imply that you stay around this Q4 run rate for all of 2016. Can you just give us a sense of how much visibility you have into that throughout the year? And you gave us some sub-commentary on your evolving relationship with Amgen, but any additional color would be helpful, and what gives you confidence there? Thank you. Michael L. Levitz - Chief Financial Officer : Well, I'll speak to the financial impact aspect and Dan can speak to the relationship. From a financial standpoint, we've talked in the past about \u2013 we take orders from Amgen, and they give us a view into the future. And as you can see, by the significant growth we're talking about for the year, it's a very strong future and we're really excited about it. But, what we try and do is to levels that, you know, manufacturing and other things, is so that we can get manufacturing efficiencies and consistency of supply. And so, what you see reflected in the guidance is that level set. Again, as I've said before, is there upside to that \u2013 absolutely. As a continued adoption and everything else that would be great. But we \u2013 it's early in the year, as Pat said, so. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen we have... Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: (57:02) Go ahead. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one question. And our next question is from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair. Your line is now open. Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in at the end here. Pat or Shacey, can you talk about the manufacturing of the OmniPod going forward? Do you need to change any physical features of the product to support kind of where you're going with AP or with Bluetooth over the next two to three years that would entail kind of redoing manufacturing lines or things of that sort? Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We got a shoe horn that puts you in here at the end. But as it relates to manufacturing, we just brought Chuck Alpuche on board, a very experienced manufacturing operations executive from PepsiCo and we are going through the process of developing the long-term manufacturing strategy. Right now, we have as you know lines in \u2013 four lines in China that are up and operational, I would say, they're going to be continuing for a very long period of time as we get into the product development and the artificial pancreas we are going to have to have different modifications or maybe modified some, one or several of the lines as that product ramps up. We're taking all of that into account as we continue to develop the long-term manufacturing and footprint of our manufacturing operations around the globe. Operator : And that is all the time we have for questions. I would now like to turn the conference back to Pat Sullivan. Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Great. Thank you, operator. Look at overall, I am \u2013 I continue to be very pleased with where the company stands today and I'm very excited about where we're headed. 2015 was a year in which we reenergized and refocused the organization, strengthening \u2013 strengthening our talent, realigning our sales team and executing a winning strategy to position Insulet for long-term, sustainable, profitable growth. I feel great about all that we've accomplished in 2015, and look forward to maximizing the potential of our innovative and differentiated technology. We entered 2016 with strong momentum and our entire team is looking forward with enthusiasm and confidence to the continued innovation and long-term sustainable growth for the company that lies ahead. Thank you for listening again today and we will see you at the end of the second quarter. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

Kyle Rose - Canaccord Genuity, Inc. Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC Ryan Blicker - Cowen & Co. LLC Christian Moore - Jefferies LLC Operator : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Insulet Corporation First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Deborah R. Gordon - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Communications : Thank you, Valerie. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2016 earnings call. Joining me today are Patrick Sullivan, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Shacey Petrovic, President of Insulet Diabetes Products; Michael Levitz, Chief Financial Officer; and Dan Levangie, President, Insulet Drug Delivery. The replay of this call will be archived on our website. Our press release discussing our first quarter 2016 results and second quarter and full year 2016 guidance is also available in the Investor Relations section of our website. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to be materially different from any future results implied by such statements. Such factors include those referenced in our Safe Harbor statement, in our first quarter earnings release and in the company's filings with the SEC. With that, let me turn the call over to Pat. Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Deb. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. I'll start off today's call with a brief review of our Q1 performance and recent business highlights. Following my remarks, Mike will review our financial results in more detail and discuss our second quarter and full year 2016 guidance. Shacey will then provide an update on our commercial progress before we turn the call over to questions. Following our significant accomplishments and improved financial performance in 2015, we carried our positive momentum into the start of 2016. We are successfully executing against our long-term strategy, delivering strong results in the first quarter and making progress toward our 2016 goals. We continue to drive improved results with first quarter revenue ahead of expectations. We advanced our key commercial initiatives and made progress with our Digital Insulet strategy and artificial pancreas program. These initiatives will dramatically improve the quality of life for those living with diabetes. We are also keenly focused, along with Eli Lilly, on our concentrated insulins product development and clinical work, and we experienced dramatic growth in our drug delivery business. Now, I'd like to take the next few minutes to highlight some of the key financials for the quarter. Revenue from all of our product lines continued to grow year-over-year and our results exceeded our expectations. Revenue for the quarter was just over $81 million, about $2.5 million higher than the midpoint of our guidance range. This represented growth of about 69% compared to last quarter's revenue from continuing operations. First quarter U.S. OmniPod revenue was just under $51 million, representing 28% year-over-year growth and higher than our expectations. Our international OmniPod business delivered strong than expected growth, with revenue of more than $15 million. We are well on our way to growing our 2016 worldwide installed base by the 20% we have previously guided to and growth within the pediatric population continues to be strong. And lastly, our drug delivery business produced revenue of just over $15 million, in line with our expectations. As you know, a large portion of our drug delivery business includes sales to Amgen for their Neulasta Onpro kit, which includes our OmniPod technology. This product continues to gain remarkable adoption in the United States and we just learned from Amgen's online presentation that the Neulasta Onpro kit now represents approximately one-third of the U.S. Neulasta business that improves patient compliance to achieve maximum benefit of Neulasta. Amgen also expects Neulasta growth throughout the United States in 2016. I'd now like to take a minute to remark on the recently announced appointment of our Senior Vice President of Advanced Technology and Engineering. Aiman brings a wide breadth of technology leadership and experience to the senior leadership team. His experience in emerging technologies will accelerate our unique product position. Aiman comes to our organization with over 30 years of engineering and research and development experience and, importantly, significant software and advanced technology proficiency. He will leverage his experience in mobile technology, data and analytics and software to accelerate the success of our technology roadmap. He previously worked within the Mobile Healthcare division of Qualcomm and served for 25 years at General Electric, including with their healthcare division. We are absolutely thrilled he joined our talented leadership team to drive innovation and maximize the future potential of our OmniPod technology. During the first quarter, we made solid progress in resolving the quality and regulatory issues we encountered in the second half of 2015. We completed all activities related to the recall and Field Safety Notification, and we requested closure from the FDA. Our new QA and R18 did a great job in resolving these issues effectively. Our operations team also made great progress in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our supply chain and manufacturing operations. As an organization, we are laser focused on continuously improving the quality of our products to ensure the best possible experience for our customers. We look forward to a very exciting 2016 as our team executes a winning strategy. I am thrilled with the momentum we have experienced in our diabetes and drug delivery businesses and remain confident we have the right foundation in place to deliver long-term sustainable and profitable growth and increased value for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike. Michael L. Levitz - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you, Pat. I'll review the first quarter 2016 results and then introduce our second quarter guidance. Please note that our prior year reported results included Neighborhood Diabetes, a business we divested in February of this year. Please refer to our first quarter earnings release and the financial data schedule on our investor relations website, which aids in year-over-year comparisons of our business. As I review our results, unless otherwise stated, all commentary regarding changes will be on a year-over-year continuing operations basis, which therefore excludes Neighborhood Diabetes for all periods. We're very pleased to report the first quarter revenue growth of 69%, with revenue of over $81 million compared to $48 million. All three of our product lines contributed meaningfully to this increase. While we had an easier revenue comparison resulting from low shipments in the first quarter of 2015, our result this past quarter demonstrated significant growth, driven by the success of the ongoing commercial initiatives within our U.S. diabetes business, the volume growth in our international business, and a dramatic growth we've seen within our drug delivery business largely due to the success of Amgen's Neulasta Onpro kit, which was approved by the FDA just before the start of last year. Our gross margin was 54%, in line with our full year expectations of low to mid 50% range. Gross margin of the first quarter of last year was higher than this quarter end and higher than historic levels. The gross margin this quarter reflects the increased sales to our largest international distributor, which generally have a lower gross margin than the rest of our business. Operating expenses increased to almost $52 million compared to $36.5 million last year, primarily due to 2015 investments that we made in expanding our sales force, customer care, product development and building the foundation for continued strong growth from our commercial strategy. We ended the quarter with the cash balance of approximately $112 million compared to almost $123 million at the end of 2015. I'd like to now walk you through our outlook for 2016. We are reaffirming our previously announced full year revenue guidance of $330 million to $350 million, driven by continued strong growth across our product line. This compares to 2015 revenue of $264 million and represents growth approximately 30% at the mid-point. As a reminder, we expect this strong growth to be driven by U.S. OmniPod growth in the mid-teens on a percentage basis, international OmniPod growth of approximately 50% and drug delivery growth of approximately 75%. We believe the mid-point of our guidance range is realistic and represents our current outlook for the year, while the high-end of our range is achievable, should we experience better-than-expected growth within our U.S. and international diabetes business. For the second quarter of 2016, we expect revenue in the range of $81 million to $84 million, compared to approximate $61 million. This represents growth of over 35% at the midpoint. We anticipate strong U.S. OmniPod revenue growth in the mid- to upper-teens on a percentage basis for the quarter. We expect our International revenue to be approximately $15 million, which represents strong year-over-year growth even excluding the favorable comparable. On the drug delivery side, we expect revenue of approximately $15 million, up significantly from last year, due largely to the continued strong adoption of Amgen's Neulasta Onpro kit. Our drug delivery guidance is based on steady quarterly shipments to meet our partner's forecasted annual demand. We look forward to providing you additional color on our progress and our long-term outlook as the year progresses. I will now turn the call over to Shacey. Shacey Petrovic - President-Insulet Diabetes Products : Thanks, Mike. As we shared with you on our last earnings call, we have an enormous market opportunity before us that we are converting through improved commercial execution and a laser focus on patient retention. We are also making significant progress on our Digital Insulet product development roadmap and our artificial pancreas program. This first quarter was a success, both internationally and in the United States, and we are on track to achieve our objectives for the year. Strong commercial execution is driving market adoption of OmniPod across the globe. Our continued focus on patient retention, clinician advocacy and market access is on track to drive 20% growth in our installed base in 2016. These efforts will be bolstered by a growing body of clinical evidence, demonstrating the economic value proposition of OmniPod and the improved clinical outcomes it delivers for our users. In fact, we are pleased to announce that we have two manuscripts accepted for publication, demonstrating OmniPod's positive impact on glycemic control for individuals living with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. We are completing ongoing studies and submitting additional publications as the year progresses. We will be showcasing these studies and other data at the American Diabetes Association Scientific Sessions in June. Our longer-term growth strategy leverages innovative product development to accelerate OmniPod's market penetration. In Q2, we will launch the first step in Digital Insulet, our non-regulated OmniPod customer mobile app. This app will be available on iOS and Android devices and it will provide training tools, easy product ordering and interaction with customer care, along with other key support resources. It is designed to help improve patient retention and it will be regularly updated with additional features to deliver a great OmniPod customer experience. Later this year, we plan to submit a 510(k) for a separate mobile app and Bluetooth-enabled PDM. This app will act as a secondary display for key PDM data on a customer's mobile phone. Information such as a user's insulin-on-board, current basal profile and blood glucose readings will be at our customers' fingertips. This PDM mobile app will also provide integration of OmniPod data with Dexcom G5 data on a customer's mobile phone. This development project is on track and we plan on a submission by the end of this year. We are also working on our updated PDM and Bluetooth Pod program, with the goal of delivering increased mobile connectivity and ultimately our first product with automated glucose control or artificial pancreas functionality. We recently announced our algorithm partnership and we're executing an aggressive development program. We expect to be in clinical trials later this year and we plan on being in the market in late 2018. Providing our customers with an increasing array of mobile features and a terrific customer experience will help accelerate growth this year and next, and will be followed closely by the first product offering from our artificial pancreas program, a highly-differentiated product offering to drive significant market expansion. We are also working with Eli Lilly to get their concentrated insulins, both Humalog U-500 and Humalog U-200, each approved for use in our pods. This will ensure that people who have higher total daily insulin requirements, such as those living with Type 2 diabetes, can benefit from a three-day pod change. These projects are underway and really making great progress. The U-500 product development work is complete and the clinical trial is over half enrolled. The U-200 development work launched recently and the team is focused on product and clinical trial design work and leveraging everything that we've learned from the development of the U-500 OmniPod system. Concentrated insulins in the pod will be a reality in the next two years to three years and they will double the addressable market for OmniPod. As our recent financial and commercial results have illustrated, we are increasing awareness of OmniPod. We are growing clinical efficacy for OmniPod and we are building an innovative product pipeline to accelerate our penetration in both the Type 1 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes market. The progress we've made to support OmniPod's truly differentiated market position is exciting and we are on track to drive continued conversion of the huge market opportunity before us. I'll now turn the call back to Pat. Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Shacey. With that operator, let's open the call up for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from James Francescone from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. James Francescone - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, thank you for \u2013 thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to touch quickly on guidance for the full year and the second quarter relative to what we saw in the first quarter numbers. Typically there's been pretty nice seasonal sequential step-up from the first quarter to the second quarter and you actually got a pretty modest increase of the 2% embedded in the guide for 2Q. So, how should we be thinking about that? Should we be biased more towards the high-end of the guidance range or is there some reason why this seasonal sequential tick-up from 1Q to 2Q that we've seen in the past wouldn't be as pronounced this year? Michael L. Levitz - Chief Financial Officer : This is Mike. I would just say that, we're talking about for the year, significant growth, 30% year-over-year growth at the mid-point. We're really excited about the direction that we're going in. We just gave that guidance a short time ago and we're really pleased with where we've been in the first quarter, but we think we've got a lot of opportunities to divest in the year. We just didn't want to move on our guidance at this point, because we're \u2013 it's still early on. But we've got real upside in the diabetes business, both U.S. and international. But our guidance balances upside with what some potential risks are. But coming out of the first quarter, we are really excited and we've got really strong momentum. James Francescone - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. And then just second on operating expenses. As we rebased the models after the Neighborhood divestiture, can you help us think through what the trend on OpEx through the year might look like? Michael L. Levitz - Chief Financial Officer : Hi, this is Mike again. What I would say, you know, we haven't given guidance for OpEx by quarter or for the year, but what I have said is that the growth that we're seeing in OpEx is largely reflective of the full year impact of investments that we made in 2015. So with that in mind, I think it's a reasonable position to look at where we exited 2015 from a run rate standpoint. We do expect an increase this year compared to last year, other than just the full year impact, but it really is largely that full year impact. So we expect improved operating leverage this year, even with the investments that we're making in the different areas that Shacey described in R&D and the full year impact of investments we've made in other places. So, I think if you look at the first quarter results compared to the run rate there from Q4, we're essentially in line when you pull out the items that we described as non-recurring in the fourth quarter. James Francescone - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Perfectly clear. Thanks, Mike. I'll get back in queue. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy from Leerink. Your line is open. Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC : Thanks so much for taking the question and congrats on an excellent quarter. I was wondering if you could touch on two things. Number one, new patient adds were strong again in the quarter. I was wondering if you could give some color on what's driving that. I mean, obviously, you guys have been building rebuilding out the sales force, how much is execution versus just your standard easier comps year-over-year? And then the second question is on the drug delivery, I was wondering if you can give any color on how much is due to stockings? Sorry if you've commented on the prepared remarks and I missed it. Thanks so much. Shacey Petrovic - President-Insulet Diabetes Products : Sure. Danielle, this is Shacey. In terms of what's driving new patient adds, I'm not sure if we gave color into that. But we're on track to deliver the guidance in terms of the installed base. So we're guiding to a 20% increase in our installed base. And in the United States, one of the contributing factors is that we anticipate somewhere around the 20% increase in new patient adds this year as well. What's driving that really is commercial execution in the U.S. And so that is primarily driven by account targeting from the stronger clinical messaging and from better pipeline management internally, so that our sales team can really focus their selling time in the field on converting clinicians to recommend OmniPod for their patients. And then the other thing I would say is there is a growing body of clinical evidence that just continues to support the value of using CSII are Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion Therapy \u2013 Pump Therapy for patients. All of that is working in our favor. And we're excited about the results of Q1, it's just one quarter, but things are strong. Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And Dan, the other is on the \u2013 you got it. You just did such an eloquent job last quarter, I thought I'd... Daniel J. Levangie - President-Drug Delivery Division : Yeah, so with respect to question about Amgen's' use of the product, I think they just reported that at the end of the quarter, the Onpro kit accounted for about a third of the doses in the United States. And so they are in a much better position to answer the question as to how much of their purchases from us during the quarter represented stocking versus utilization. But we do know utilization is roughly a third of the doses in the U.S. or being administered using the Onpro kit. Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Operator, next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next comes from Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. I apologize. I may have missed it, but new patient starts, it sounded like Danielle heard it but I did not. I know last three quarters, it was up 20% year-over-year, did you give a number for this quarter? Shacey Petrovic - President-Insulet Diabetes Products : Mike I just answered Danielle's questions. I don't think I gave it in my opening remarks, but we do expect in the U.S. that new patient starts will grow approximately 20% in 2016 versus 2015 in the United States. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And what was it this quarter? Shacey Petrovic - President-Insulet Diabetes Products : We don't give it quarterly. So just to let you know that we're making progress and we're on track. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : You guys gave every quarter, last year right? Shacey Petrovic - President-Insulet Diabetes Products : I think it was just because it was a new management team, a lot of moving parts from the business last year with some of the inventory management challenges and so we wanted to give that granularity. So, what we wanted to do this year and what I indicated last quarter was that we will guide you to our annual objectives and guidance for the installed base and new patient starts and then let you know if we're on track or if for some reason we're changing that guidance. So, the message is, we're on track, things look good. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Let me just \u2013 quick follow up then. So two questions. One, with \u2013 we can do the math on Amgen. We have a pretty good read how much every quarter is underlying demand versus the reported sales. Do you think just with the math and how much you're reporting this year in sales, do you think Amgen revenues grow after 2016? Daniel J. Levangie - President-Drug Delivery Division : Yeah. Our assumption would be that there would continue to be growth opportunity in 2017. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : In the U.S., I mean, first of all just talk about U.S. opportunity, because the max-out in the U.S. opportunity is about $50 million. Daniel J. Levangie - President-Drug Delivery Division : I'm not sure how you got to that answer. As they just reported, they're about a-third of the doses converted as we speak. So you could assume, if you assume the straight line trajectory from where we started to where we are today, I think that would get you around 50% probably at the end of the year. I think that leaves another 50% for 2017. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : In terms of revenue, because there's the stocking revenues. I'm differentiating between patients. Daniel J. Levangie - President-Drug Delivery Division : Yeah. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So talk about reported revenue, because you're reporting obviously \u2013 a significant chunk of your revenues right now are stocking. So that's going to create comparison for you for 2017, that's what I'm asking. Daniel J. Levangie - President-Drug Delivery Division : Yeah. Well, let me just say, I would expect growth in 2017. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : All right. Thank you guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tao Levy of Wedbush. Your line is open. Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys. Maybe I could ask on attrition rates, as I play around with the model, you know, in order to get to your guidance in the second quarter, without boosting new patient adds significantly, you know, your attrition rates need to come down quite dramatically. Is that what you're seeing in the field or is that something that's incorrect in my model? Shacey Petrovic - President-Insulet Diabetes Products : I guess I would suggest you look at your model. Nothing substantively has changed in terms of the attrition rate. And so we're feeling good about certainly the initiatives that we have in place to support a reduction in attrition over time and an improvement in retention this year. But no, we're not expecting attrition to increase in Q2. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is Jayson Bedford of Raymond James. Your line is open. Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Just wondering if you could talk about the international business and if new reimbursement in France had any outsized impact on the business in the first quarter? Shacey Petrovic - President-Insulet Diabetes Products : Hi, Jayson. No, I don't \u2013 certainly Ypsomed prepared for their market entry into France this year, and they did that in Q1. But in any new market entry in Europe, it's a really small component of the whole. So, while they prepared for entry into France, I don't think it had a substantive impact on the international revenue performance. Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. So this is a pretty clean number. There wasn't any stocking at all in there? Shacey Petrovic - President-Insulet Diabetes Products : That's right. Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then just secondly on the guidance, and talking about the high-end of the annual guidance, you kind of inferred that the upside would stem either from the international or the U.S. diabetes business. So is it fair to assume that your drug delivery number here is pretty much locked in, meaning I realize it's growing well, but you're not really expecting any upside from that going forward? Michael L. Levitz - Chief Financial Officer : Jayson this is Mike. I would say that the guidance, as we've stated, is \u2013 the high-end of the guidance is reflective of upside in the diabetes business. And the upside in drug delivery would be incremental to that if it occurs. But we're early in the year. We're really pleased with how Amgen is doing and the growth in the adoption of the product. But at this point, you know, we've got a view into their demand for the year and that's what we based our guidance on. But... Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And just to add a little bit of color to that, Amgen gives us purchase orders. We ship them product based upon their purchase orders. If they increase the purchase order volume going forward, it will be reflected in our shipments. It's pretty simple. So we don't \u2013 we're not baking anything in. We're using what they provide us to come up with the guidance we provided. And if that changes on the upside, as Dan mentioned, they're expecting to grow (28:03) throughout this year, we'll reflect that in our performance going forward. Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And Pat, your visibility in to that is basically rolling 12 months, is that fair? Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, it's 90-day firm forecast \u2013 90 day firm, and then the rest of it is basically a forecast. Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kyle Rose of Canaccord. Your line is open. Kyle Rose - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great, thanks a lot for taking my question. Can you hear me all right? Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We got you. Kyle Rose - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Yes. So just two questions and then I will hop back in queue. The first is just underlying patient utilization metrics in the U.S. business. I mean, it sounds like no changes to attrition, but just wondered if you could qualify some of the new patient growth. I mean where are you really seeing that come from and then any updates or changes as far as the utilization from those patients? And then secondly, OUS, Ypsomed, I believe they were launching into a number of new countries over the coming year. Just wanted to see how much of the growth, when you think about your growth, is coming from entrance into some of those new geographies versus continued share taking in the existing geographies. Thank you. Shacey Petrovic - President-Insulet Diabetes Products : Sure, Kyle. In terms of your question regarding where are new patient starts coming from? Just like previous quarters, the vast majority, between 70% and 80% of our new patient starts come from people who were formerly using multiple daily injections. So that's where the vast majority of our business is coming from. We really are helping to drive adoption of pump therapy across this patient subset. And then the question regarding Ypsomed and the value of new patient entries \u2013 or new market entries versus existing base, really we're seeing growth in both the existing base and new market entries. And there base continues to grow such that the new market entries and new patient adds is a little bit smaller of a component. But I wouldn't attribute too much to market entries. They've been relatively small, France is a bit figure, and so over time, that's probably going to contribute a bit more. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Ben Andrew of William Blair. Your line is open. Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question guys. Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Ben. Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you. You talked about the Bluetooth-enabled PDM and kind of the plan there to display data and integrate the Dexcom data into the display. What's it going to take from a development standpoint and from a timing standpoint to start pushing data back or commands back towards the OmniPod? So you've talked about manufacturing of Bluetooth- enabled version, etcetera? Does that tie into the 2018 timeframe or can you do something along those lines earlier? Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, as you think about the Bluetooth-enabled pod and a launch in 2018 as Shacey talked about with the artificial pancreas, we're going to be have to be able to push those back. So we would start that programming and start essentially seeding the inventory into the filed with the Bluetooth-enabled pod ahead of the launch of that product. So it would back up and we have that in our development timeline and implementation program. Shacey Petrovic - President-Insulet Diabetes Products : In terms \u2013 oh, I'm sorry. I was going to say in terms of control from the phone to the pod that is still something that we are discussing with the FDA. And so we don't have really good guidance in terms of timing on that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel of Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Ryan Blicker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. This is Ryan Blicker in for Doug. Thanks for taking my question. So, strong gross margin quarter in line with your full year guidance. Is there any reason why gross margin can't increase sequentially throughout 2016 as your mix of U.S. diabetes revenue continues to increase? Michael L. Levitz - Chief Financial Officer : This is Mike. What was talked about on gross margin is our guidance for the year is, as I said, low-to-mid 50% range. We definitely believe we have upside to that. But, as we saw last year, there can be challenges as well as we ramp up the operations. So, our guidance reflects really a balancing act of those things. But, structurally, we don't believe there's any reason why we wouldn't be at our target that we've talked about before of 60%-plus gross margins. In terms of sequentially guiding gross margin through this year, we're really not in a position to do that. And we guide for the year and we guide revenue by quarter. But I think what we've said in terms of our expectations for the year reflects the fact, and Pat mentioned, we're really pleased with what our operations, manufacturing, supply chain team is doing. We've got what we believe to be a lot of opportunity. And those things take time and that's reflected in our guidance. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Christian Moore of Jefferies. Your line is open. Christian Moore - Jefferies LLC : Hey. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. I just wanted to have a quick question on the progress that Medtronic has had with the MiniMed 640G over the course of the last year. Have you seen the competitive landscape change internationally as you both pursue a closed loop product and what do you see playing out for the course of 2016 on that front? Shacey Petrovic - President-Insulet Diabetes Products : Yeah. Internationally, we have not actually heard a lot of buzz regarding the 640G and, obviously, it's not here in the United States. And obviously, we continue to grow our business internationally and take share of the market as well as help grow the overall market. So I guess I don't have a lot of comment on that. In terms of United States in 2016, we see the same dynamics in terms of the market growing. So more people moving to pump therapy and OmniPod taking a greater share of that market. So, we don't see it slowing down our growth in the near term and things are progressing nicely. Christian Moore - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thanks. And then on the drug delivery front, you mentioned the progress of Neulasta, that you're now in one-third of Neulasta deliveries, what kind of capital investment would be required there to serve other partners down the road in order to maintain the strong growth in that segment? Daniel J. Levangie - President-Drug Delivery Division : Well, I think as we've discussed in the past, we have a number of other agreements in hand with other potential drug delivery partners in which there's a development process underway. I think, down the road, we could see potentially see revenue that would come to us as a part of those development agreements. But we haven't given that guidance at this point in time. But, in terms of capital investment by Insulet, we would hope to be able to structure agreements that would offset some of that capital investment or all of that capital investment by having our partners pay for that. Operator : Thank you. Daniel J. Levangie - President-Drug Delivery Division : Did I understand your question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Now that we've gotten through kind of the quarter discussion. One big picture question, Pat. I was hoping you could just talk a little bit about the OmniPod manufacturing process. And we've been seeing \u2013 it's been ten years and we've seen the manufacturing process ramp and productivity obviously improve with volume. But it's hard to drive the cost of manufacturing OmniPod down meaningfully with the current process they use. Can you just talk about any efforts underway to try and rethink the OmniPod manufacturing process and where those may stand? Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. First of all, Mike, I would disagree with you that we don't have an opportunity to drive additional cost out of our cost of goods sold through improved supply chain and manufacturing operations efficiency and effectiveness and certainly with the addition of Chuck Alpuche that came on board in early February. We're already seeing, alluded to in my prepared comments, improvements in our manufacturing operations efficiency. And ultimately, we believe an opportunity to take cost out of the manufacturing process and reduce the cost of goods sold to improve our margins. We see a pathway to do that. We started those initiatives early this year and are making great initial progress. As everyone knows, it takes longer to affect those kinds of changes in the manufacturing process to drive those efficiencies and, therefore, cost out, but I think we've got significant room to improve the cost of goods sold and, therefore, the margins with our existing manufacturing operations. We're also looking at and working on a long-term manufacturing strategy as we look to add additional capacity, which we know we're going to have to do in the next couple of years to have redundancy outside or perhaps inside of China. We have four lines in one location. And certainly, we want to be thoughtful about where and when we put additional manufacturing capacity in place, but that will also have an opportunity to drive the cost per pod down as we increase our volumes and perhaps improve the automation efficiency of the manufacturing process. So I think we \u2013 Mike as talked about a pathway to a 60% gross margin for the business. There's clear line of sight to get there. And part of that will come through improving the margins out the factory. Operator : Thank you. We have question from Tao Levy of Wedbush. Your line is open. Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks for the follow up. So a question on \u2013 two questions. International Neulasta, obviously, you guys are having success here in the U.S. and it's the larger market, but they do sell the product internationally, so just wondering if there's a program there or opportunity over there. And also, I don't know if you commented on operating expense guidance for the rest of the year, for the full year? Thanks. Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. With respect to the Neulasta Onpro kit outside the United States, obviously, that's an Amgen decision. We would be excited, obviously, to launch the product outside the U.S. together with Amgen and to see the rate of success that we've seen in the U.S. But, frankly, that's a decision that's really up to them. We're prepared to support that, but have not made any announcements about that international expansion at this point. Michael L. Levitz - Chief Financial Officer : And Tao, this is Mike. In terms of the operating expenses, there was an earlier question on that. But, just to reiterate, so we don't give specific operating expense guidance. We give revenue guidance by quarter and we give gross margin for the year. But what I have said is that we expect our expenses to increase this year, but that's really driven primarily from the full year impact of initiatives in 2015 related to the expansion of our sales force, customer care, product development initiatives that we put in place, and just overall investments in the underlying foundation for our growth. So, if you look at where we ended last year, when you pull out the things that we identified last quarter into the Q4 run rate that we said were non-recurring in nature, you'll see that Q1 is essentially in line with that apart from just some timing things on some program spend. So there is going to be growth. We are making continued investments here. We're really excited about those investments and Shacey talked about some of those, the concentrated insulins and otherwise, but there will be improved operating leverage this year. And we talked about being EBIT positive in 2018 and that's definitely very real. And as we've talked about in the previous conversations on calls, we would love to beat that. But we really need to drive execution and between all the different movement, the moves that Pat's described and the improvements in gross margin, in cost of goods sold and operating leverage and mix and otherwise, there's a lot of good things that support the pathway to doing the things that we've said we would do. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. I was just going to follow up. Pat, I was just wondering if you could comment on Howard Zisser's departure for Verily and where you are in the process of replacing him? Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. I guess it was about two weeks ago now, Howard informed me that he has taken a job at Google's \u2013 yeah, I forgot the name of the company \u2013 their healthcare company to be in charge of their clinicals. I guess it was Verily. So he informed me of that a couple of weeks ago. He as the part of the company is (42:23) now at Google. We thank him for everything that he's done. He did a great job for us in all of the work he did on the artificial pancreas and he really wanted to see the benefits of his labor and we've done that now with our AGC agreement, and Howard did a terrific job for us. And we wish him well with what he's doing. I think it is a great opportunity for him, quite frankly, in the Google environment. As it relates to replacing him, we are, in the short term, reaching out to our scientific advisors and those in the community to help us on the short term support and we are looking to replace Howard as Medical Director in the future, looking to another, obviously, endocrinologist that can help us get smarter about diabetes and guide us in our product development activities as well as our relations with the other constituencies that we deal with. So pretty excited for Howard and it gives us an opportunity to hire a replacement for him. Operator : Thank you. The last question will be from Canaccord. Your line is open. Kyle Rose - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much for the follow-up. Just wanted to see if you could give us an update on or the status of reimbursement in the Medicare, Medicaid population and then any upside that you could expect to see from there over the course of 2016? Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I continue with CMS coverage for Medicare beneficiaries being one of my top \u2013 if not my top priority. Nothing new to report since we last spoke to you about 60 days ago. We are making progress on the Medicaid front with coverage decisions or our coverage in some key states, Texas, Florida and New Jersey. And we've targeted other states, the higher population states throughout the U.S. for Medicaid coverage that we can go and that goes down one at a time, but we're very focused not only on CMS, but on Medicaid, where, as you know, we have a very attractive product for the pediatric population and focus on providing that to those patients who are on Medicaid. So, stay tuned. I'll let you know as soon as I know. But I think we're making progress. Operator : Thank you. I'll now turn the conference back over to Pat Sullivan. Patrick J. Sullivan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. We are starting 2016, I think, with a very strong momentum and I have to tell you, our entire team is energized and very confident in our continued innovation and long term sustainable growth that lies ahead of us. We have the team in place, functional experts in engineering, manufacturing, quality, regulatory and we're making progress across all fronts. And I'm just very excited about the opportunity that lies before us and its all within our ability to execute. So very excited about it. We'll keep giving back to you every quarter and thank you for participating in the call today and we'll speak to you again as we make progress throughout the year. Thanks for participating. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for our second-quarter 2016 earnings call. Joining me today are Patrick Sullivan, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Shacey Petrovic, President of Insulin Diabetes Products; Michael Levitz, Chief Financial Officer; and Dan Levangie, President, Insulet Drug Delivery. The replay of this call will be archived on our website. Our press release discussing our second-quarter 2016 results and third-quarter and full-year 2016 guidance is also available the IR section of our website. Before we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to be materially different from any future results implied by such statements. Such factors include those referenced in our Safe Harbor statement and our second-quarter earnings release and in the Company's filings with the SEC. With that, let me turn the call over to Pat. Patrick Sullivan : Thank you, Deb. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. First of all, I'd like to begin with a brief review of our second-quarter performance and the recent business highlights. Following my remarks, Mike will discuss our financial results in more detail and provide our third-quarter and full-year guidance. As noted in the press release, we are raising the full-year guidance by $10 million at the midpoint. Shacey will then provide an update on our exciting commercial progress. We will then turn the call over for questions. To start off with, I am just absolutely thrilled with the performance of the Company for the quarter. Our positive momentum accelerated throughout the second quarter, and I have been very impressed with the significant progress our team has made on all our key commercial and operational initiatives across each area of the business. We are building on our foundations and executing our strategy to deliver long-term, sustainable, and profitable growth. While we realize there's still a lot of work for us to do, we continue to grow our top line and invest in the business to deliver innovation to our customers and significantly improve our operational and manufacturing processes while remaining focused like a laser beam on achieving our profitability goal. I'm very confident in our ability to drive long-term shareholder value. As Shacey will describe in more detail later, we had two publications in the Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology as well as six presentations at the American Diabetes Association's 76th Scientific Session of new data demonstrating the benefits of Insulet's OmniPod system for people living with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. We will continue to invest in clinical studies to build the bibliography of scientific evidence demonstrating the clinical and economic benefits of the OmniPod to both physicians and payors. I'd like to take a few minutes to highlight some of our key financial metrics for the quarter. Our second-quarter revenue and gross margin results were both ahead of our expectations. Revenue from all of our product lines continued to grow year-over-year, with total revenue for the quarter of just over $87 million, $5 million higher than the midpoint of our guidance range. This represents growth of about 44% compared to Q2 of last year's revenue from continuing operations. Second-quarter US OmniPod revenue was just over $56 million, higher than our expectations and representing a strong 24% year-over-year growth. Our international OmniPod business also delivered stronger-than-expected results, with revenue of almost $17 million as we are seeing nice growth in our existing markets as well as gaining traction in new markets such as France. We are solidly on track to grow our 2016 worldwide installed base by 20%, consistent with our previous guidance. Our drug delivery business produced revenue of approximately $14.5 million and in line with our expectations. As you know, a large portion of this business includes sales to Amgen for their Neulasta OnPro kit. This product continues to gain remarkable adoption in the United States. On their earnings call last week, Amgen noted the OnPro kit now represents a 40% conversion of their Neulasta business. We are very, very pleased with the adoption so far. I'd also now like to highlight some of our accomplishments in product development and manufacturing. In product development, we opened our new innovation center of excellence in San Diego during the quarter. Our new SVP of R&D, Aiman Abdel-Malek, has quickly built a digital skill set in both San Diego and Boston, bringing on key talent in mobile applications, data analytics, algorithms, and user experience. We are thrilled with the impact he and his team are having on our innovation roadmap, and we will debut a truly differentiated and connected system at next year's ADA -- and, following that, a best-in-class artificial pancreas system. Aiman has built a very impressive and exceptional and experienced product development team. During the second quarter, we made significant improvements in our manufacturing operations and also in our global supply chain and logistics. Chuck Alpuche, our new SVP of Global Manufacturing and Operations, and his entire team have made remarkable progress. The first indication of this progress is the achievement of 58% gross margin in the second quarter, up over 7 percentage points versus Q2 of last year. We are absolutely on track to significantly improve our gross margins, and we believe we have a clear line of sight to over 65% over the coming years. This change will be driven by several initiatives, including, number one, significantly improving the operating efficiency in the factory. Since just the first of this year, we have increased the daily production volume in the factory by over 50% and, at the same time, reduced scrap rate by over 50%. That accomplishment is simply just stunning -- increasing the volume by over 50%, reducing scrap by 50%. As a result, by the end of this month, end of August, we will produce more pods in the first eight months of this year than we produced during all of 2015. Number two, improving the supply chain by implementing new arrangements with our existing and new suppliers to provide for redundancy and reduce cost. And, third, improving logistics to reduce product landed cost. As an example, we ship all assembled product from China by air freight, much of it expedited and at very premium price. As a direct result of the 50% increase in our daily production volume I just spoke about, we are already building inventory to support the implementation and be on the ocean by the end of this year. We estimate that this change alone, when fully implemented, could add 1 percentage point of gross margin. And I just use this as a single example of an opportunity to improve our gross margins. There are other initiatives we are evaluating, but this is a very rich target environment of opportunities to improve our gross margin. We have prioritized those opportunities and are executing a plan to significantly improve our gross margin -- and, again, have a clear line of sight to 65%. But it will obviously take time and continued investments in our manufacturing operations. Our manufacturing and operations team is truly exceptional, and they are doing a terrific job. The numbers just simply speak for themselves. We look forward to a very exciting second half of 2016 as our team continues to execute on our winning strategy. We are building the foundation for long-term sustainable growth in all areas of our business. We have the strategy and, most importantly, we have a talented team dedicated to successfully execute the strategy. We look forward to sharing details with you later this year during an investor day November, where we plan to provide more color on our diabetes R&D roadmap, our product pipeline, and our key commercial, our operational and manufacturing initiatives, and our pathway to profitability. With that, I'll turn it over to Mike. Michael Levitz : Thank you, Pat. I will review the second-quarter 2016 results and then introduce our third-quarter guidance and update our full-year guidance. Our prior-year results, for comparative purposes, exclude Neighborhood Diabetes, which we divested this February. As I review our results, unless otherwise stated, all commentary regarding changes will be on a year-over-year basis. We are very pleased to report second-quarter revenue growth of 44%, with revenue of $87.3 million compared to $60.6 million. All three of our product lines contributed meaningfully to this increase. Our results this past quarter once again demonstrated significant growth, driven by the success of the ongoing commercial initiatives within our US diabetes business, rapid volume growth internationally, and dramatic growth in drug delivery. While we had an easier year-over-year comparison within our international business resulting from the lower shipments in the second quarter of 2015, on an apples-to-apples basis the growth in this business was substantial and exceeded our expectations due to strong end-user demand across our international markets as well as early success we are experiencing in France, where OmniPod was launched during the second quarter. We are also very pleased, as Pat said, to report our gross margin increase to 57.8%, up from 50.4%, again exceeding our expectations as our investments in improving manufacturing and supply chain efficiency and effectiveness, as well as improving the overall product quality, are already beginning to pay off. As a result, we believe that our gross margin this quarter represents a new baseline for our business and is indicative of what we expect to realize during the second half of this year. We expect this will result in gross margins for the year in the mid-to-upper 50% range, up from our earlier expectations of the low-to-mid 50% range, based on the significant progress made to date on our operational initiatives. We are also confident in achieving our longer-term stated goal of 65% gross margins and look forward to continuing to update you on our progress. Operating expenses increased to $52 million compared to close to $45 million last year, primarily due to the investments that we made in 2015, expanding our sales force, customer care, and product development in support of continued strong growth from our commercial strategy. On the growth in both revenues and gross margin, our operating loss improved to $1.3 million compared to a loss of $14.1 million just a year ago. We are pleased with our progress to date on our strategic initiatives as we continue to invest to drive business growth in the near- and longer-term while remaining focused on driving the pathway to profitability. We ended the quarter with $111 million in cash and investments compared to $123 million at the end of 2015. I'd like to now walk you through our outlook for 2016. Given our better-than-expected second-quarter revenue and the strong momentum in our commercial business, we are raising our full-year revenue guidance and now anticipate achieving revenue in the range of $345 million to $355 million compared to our previous range of $330 million to $350 million. This compares to 2015 revenue of $264 million and represents growth of approximately 33% at the midpoint. We expect this strong annual growth to be driven by growth across our business, with US OmniPod growth in the upper teens on a percentage basis, up from our previous guidance of midteens; international OmniPod growth of approximately 65% -- that's up from our previous guidance of 50%; and drug delivery growth of approximately 75% or roughly $60 million in annual revenue, consistent with the guidance we provided previously. We believe the midpoint of our guidance range is realistic and represents our current outlook for the year, while the high end of our range is achievable should we experience better-than-expected growth, primarily within our international diabetes business. We are very excited about the trends in our business, and our expected top-line results reflect the continued positive results from our investments in and execution of our key commercial initiatives. For the third quarter of 2016, we expect revenue in the range of $88 million to $91 million compared to $71.4 million, representing growth of approximately 25% at the midpoint. This is driven by OmniPod revenue growth in the United States in the low teens on a percentage basis and international growth of approximately 25%. While year-over-year comparisons in the first half of this year were impacted by distributor ordering patterns in 2015, those ordering patterns stabilized by the end of the second quarter last year. And therefore, the growth expectations for the third quarter are directly in line with increasing end-user demand. We also expect drug delivery revenue to reach approximately $15 million in the third quarter -- that's over twice as much as last year -- on continued strong adoption of Amgen's Neulasta Onpro kit. Our drug delivery guidance reflects steady shipments throughout 2016 to meet our partner's forecasted annual demand. We look forward to providing you additional color on our progress and on our long-term outlook as the year progresses. I will now turn the call over to Shacey. Shacey Petrovic : Thanks, Mike. As we shared with you all on our last two earnings calls, we have a large and exciting market opportunity before us. And thanks to continued commercial focus and execution, we are retaining and converting new OmniPod users at unprecedented rates. And as Pat stated, we are on track to grow our US new users and our global OmniPod installed base by 20% this year. Q2 was another successful quarter with record-setting new patient starts, and we are well on our way to achieving our objectives for the year. Our strong commercial execution is driving market adoption around the world through targeted clinical messaging on the significant benefits of OmniPod, particularly from multiple daily injection users; through robust adoption in the United States of our best-in-class data management system, Insulet Provided Glooko; through increased focus on our new user training, customer support, and an exceptional customer experience; and, finally, through high growth rates in our international markets. I'll briefly expand on each of these. Our team continues to reach payors and high potential endocrinology accounts with a simple clinical message, OmniPod improves glycemic control, it enhances quality of life, and it provides an unparalleled freedom for people living with insulin-dependent diabetes. In June this message was buoyed by a strong clinical presence at the American Diabetes Association's Scientific Sessions and also by the publication of two compelling OmniPod clinical studies. At ADA, there were six presentations that demonstrated the benefits of OmniPod, including data from a large, retrospective study evaluating patients with both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. This study demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in A1c levels, reduced hypoglycemic events, and reduced total daily dose of insulin three months after starting OmniPod -- compared not only to previous MDI therapy but also, remarkably, compared to tubed-pump therapy. These results were published in the Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology. The data has strengthened our discussions with payors and, in fact, was highlighted in the American Journal of Managed Care Healthcare News shortly after its publication. Our new data management system, Insulet Provided Glooko, is also driving increased OmniPod adoption. We now have more than 1,000 clinics enrolled and new enrollments daily. This important tool enables clinicians to identify candidates for OmniPod and helps customers and their care teams make informed decisions regarding their OmniPod settings and diabetes management. Clinics who are up and running with Insulet Provided Glooko typically increase their OmniPod prescriptions at least twofold, thanks to the system's ease of use and robust functionality. Our team remains laser focused on providing a fantastic customer experience. Progress continues on programs to differentiate OmniPod through exceptional customer service, support, and the best new user training. This quarter we launched two initiatives focused on these goals. The first is a partnership with Joslin Clinic to provide our clinical service managers with advanced diabetes educator training. Insulet's clinical team is the first in our industry to complete this specialized certification program on managing diabetes, pattern recognition, and other factors critical to our successful onboarding with OmniPod. We are thrilled with the early feedback on the impact of this program for both our clinicians and their OmniPod patients. And second, as we previewed last quarter, we launched our first OmniPod mobile app, and it's now available on iOS and Android devices. We've had over 4,000 downloads, and we continue to see steady increases in utilization and in reorders placed through the app. And just this month we launched our pediatric app at the Children with Diabetes Friends for Life conference in Orlando. So more to come throughout the year on that, but very early reviews have been terrific. Finally, this quarter we experienced exciting growth in Canada and Europe and higher-than-expected demand in France. Physicians in France have told us that there is pent-up demand for OmniPod, and that is beginning to increase the already significant growth in our international business. The growth that we've seen so far this year, even in markets like Europe, with more automated insulin delivery competition, illustrates OmniPod's unique value proposition. If people living with diabetes prioritized automation and control features, we would see more people on pumps today. But across the United States and Europe, less than 30% of people living with Type 1 diabetes use pumps. Our customers tell us that this because traditional pumps are overly complex, with onerous learning curves; because they don't want to be tethered to a pump; and because as pumps have added features, they've also added alerts and alarms, which can result in a frustrating user experience. So while we think that increasing automation has the potential to add value in the market, it's only if it comes with less complexity for the user. The reason why OmniPod appeals to MDI users and why we help attract people onto pod therapy is because we have a simple, easy-to-use, discrete device that offers improved control without having to deal with up to 42 inches of tubing and an overly complex user interface. This is why we are focused on the big picture and not the pump market share. We target that the more than 70% of the market that has not adopted pump therapy. This is the market segment from which our new users come. 70% to 80% of our new customers are previous MDI users, and more than half of them tell us that they would not have come to pump therapy if not for OmniPod. For these people, OmniPod offers freedom, discretion, flexibility, and a much improved user experience over other delivery options. So we see great momentum across our commercial OmniPod business, and I am proud of the tangible progress that our team has made so far this year. We've also made great headway on our innovation roadmap. The new OmniPod customer mobile app is the first step in Digital Insulet, and we are encouraged by the adoption rate and the enthusiasm that our users have for more data and functionality on their mobile phones. As we've discussed, this mobile app will be followed by our next step in Digital Insulet, which is the launch of our Bluetooth-enabled PDM pod PDM mobile app. The team is working diligently to deliver an innovative new system, and we are looking forward to debuting this exciting platform at ADA in San Diego next year. This Bluetooth system will enable users to view key PDM information on their mobile phone and will enable integration with Dexcom's G5 data via a mobile app. All of this work on our mobile platform is also being leveraged to deliver our artificial pancreas system. We continue to make exciting progress on our AP program. We held our investigators' meeting last month, and we are working with the FDA to finalize our clinical trial protocol. But we expect to be in on-body clinical trials later on this fall. We're also working with Eli Lilly to get their concentrated insulins, Humalog U500 and U200, approved for use in our pod. This is a considerable growth opportunity for us, as it effectively doubles our addressable market by enabling us to better serve both Type 1 and Type 2 individuals with higher daily insulin requirements. We are making great progress with both of these projects. In fact, we're more than halfway done with clinical trials for U500; and the U200 development work is progressing as planned, with the product and clinical design work well underway. These innovative product launches fuel attractive growth for OmniPod over the next few years and position Insulet to accelerate growth and further over the horizon. And more importantly, they enable us to continue to significantly improve the lives of people living with diabetes throughout the world. Our team's efforts for the past year are beginning to pay off with substantial growth and transformation in 2016. There is a clear path to profitability as we continue to innovate and increase both the recognition and the adoption of OmniPod. We are really excited about our accomplishments to date, but our work has only just begun. We will continue to drive market access, awareness, and adoption of OmniPod to ensure that all people living with insulin-dependent diabetes can benefit from our truly remarkable technology. I'll now turn the call back to Pat. Patrick Sullivan : Thanks, Shacey. Operator, we'll now open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy from Leerink Partners. Danielle Antalffy : Thanks so much for taking the question, and congrats on a really great quarter. It's great to see. I was wondering -- I don't know if, Shacey, you can comment on this, but is there any way to parse out from a new patient add perspective -- strong numbers in the quarter; how much is coming from new physicians prescribing versus sort of same-store kind of sales? Shacey Petrovic : Sure, yes, it's a good question, and we watch it carefully. In fact, we saw both an expansion of prescribing physicians as well as an increase in depth or utilization among our prescribing physicians. So I would say actually the depth may have contributed a little bit more, but we did see both breadth and depth increase so far this year. Danielle Antalffy : Okay. And any sense of what is driving that? I know you have a few things going on right now. You sort of revamped the sales force; you've got the partnerships with the Omnipod Podder. So I guess -- and the remote monitoring, and things like that. So I'm just wondering, what's driving that, and how sustainable is it? And what might be the right growth outlook for the business over the medium to long term, now that you are seeing such better performance so far year to date? Shacey Petrovic : So on the first part, what's driving this, clearly, our sales force is really hitting its stride after the expansion that we completed in 2015. In fact, we see efficiency back to pre-expansion levels or even slightly above that. So that's starting to really pay off for us. We see, obviously, the clinical data that was presented at ADA having a nice halo effect on support and adoption for OmniPod, and same thing with increased access. And so, as you all know, I think, we expanded our market access team. We doubled that team earlier this year, and they're having some success in terms of driving Medicaid access across the country. So all of those things are adding to more physicians prescribing more. And I think in terms of depth, Insulet Provided Glooko is really helping with depth and getting more utilization out of clinicians who were already prescribing a little bit of OmniPod. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tao Levy from Wedbush. Tao Levy : Congratulations on a very nice quarter. So the question I had, what type of visibility do you have into your distributors -- just to make sure this phenomenal quarter is really driven by end users? And also, if you could comment on pediatrics and kind of how that performed in the quarter versus non-pediatric patients? Thanks. Patrick Sullivan : I'll answer the distributor question, Tao. It was absolutely, positively a cleaning quarter. There was no stocking in any of the channel anywhere in the world. Shacey Petrovic : Nor will there be. Patrick Sullivan : Ever. Shacey Petrovic : In terms of pediatric, population is still our fastest-growing patient population and still a great contributor this quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of James Francescone from Morgan Stanley. James Francescone : Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to clarify point. The gross margin target in the long-term of 65% -- you didn't quite frame it like this, but as recently as last quarter we were talking about 60%. So we've added 5 points to the GM outlook in a quarter. Is that correct? Michael Levitz : This is Mike. Yes, that's correct. To be clear, what we've said before is we said 60%-plus was our target. But we felt we needed to prove our way there. As Pat mentioned, we brought in a new team in operations. We made a lot of effort, a lot of investments in that space just a few short months ago. And our expectation was that it was going to take a good amount of time to really see the benefits. And we are pleased that we are seeing the benefits sooner. And based upon what we are seeing and the opportunities, some of which Pat laid out, we believe not only that this is sustainable at this level, but that the opportunities that are ahead of us are meaningful and actionable. And so Pat laid out a few examples of those. And there are others that we are evaluating that we believe give us a clear line of sight to the higher target of 65% and beyond. James Francescone : Okay, that's helpful. And then further on down in the P&L, you have managed to add a lot of revenue over the past four or five quarters while sales and marketing has been essentially flat, maybe even down a little bit. Can you help us -- you know, maybe comment on, one, why you've been so successful at adding revenue without adding a whole lot of cost? And then, two, how does that play out in the future? I mean, are we getting close to a point where we need to reinvest a bit in sales and marketing to continue to fuel that growth? Michael Levitz : This is Mike. I'll answer first, and if Shacey wants to add anything -- so we mentioned in the past that we added the -- we significantly increased the sales force ahead of revenue a year ago, in the middle of 2015. And we said that we expect it takes about a year for the reps to get up to the, you know, efficiency. We also made investments in customer care and other areas, all of which hit in the sales and marketing line ahead of when the revenue would come. And now the team has been on board for a year, has settled in, and are performing as we had hoped they would and expected that they would. So therefore, I think it is fair that we expected this kind of leverage off of that team. That said, we don't believe that we are done investing. But it's success-oriented investing. And Shacey mentioned the investment we made in the managed care team; you know, market access is an important area for us. We do expect that the level of expenses will reflect continued investment, and really -- but it's success-oriented, and it's driven by initiatives that we believe will meaningfully impact the top line and ultimately the profitability goals, as Pat said. Shacey, I don't know if --? Shacey Petrovic : Yes, the only thing I would add to that -- actually, just maybe echo what Mike said. Both customer care in terms of the pipeline management and supporting customer retention as well as the urgency of the reps is really paying off. And then we saw the managed care team, the market access team have some success really this year, too, with additional Medicaid wins. And so those things all kind of conspire together to drive revenue growth with the investments that we had already made last year and earlier this year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Mike Weinstein : Thank you. I'll add to the congratulations on the quarter. I want to focus on the gross margin improvement and really want to connect the gross margin improvement to the inventory build, because when I look at your inventory levels, it looks like they increase 75% from 1Q to 2Q and 100% since the end of the year. So that, I would assume, would seem to explain the vast majority of the gross margin improvement this quarter. So the question is, one, is this new level of inventory level the right level to assume going forward; and, two, is it correct in the longer-term to extrapolate off this 2Q gross margin? I understand that you're trying to make this transition on your freight, on your shipments of product from China to the US. But we saw this big gross margin benefit this quarter from inventory ramping up dramatically. I just want to make sure that we are thinking about this correctly. Thanks. Patrick Sullivan : I don't think you're thinking about this correctly. At the end of last year, we -- as a result of the field actions that we took and the recalls that we conducted, we basically went fairly low on inventory as a result of those two market actions. So we were low on inventory at the end of last year and built that inventory up to essentially the same level that we had previously to the -- you know, to the recall that we had in the third quarter of last year. So I would say all of what you're seeing here is improved efficiencies in the factory. I mean, a 50% daily volume increase in daily volume is terrific, and reducing scrap by 50% is terrific. And it's not due to changing inventory levels at all. Patrick Sullivan : I'm just looking at historical inventory levels, and this is just -- this is a lot higher than we've ever seen before. It's 70% higher than what we've seen historically. Michael Levitz : Mike, this is Mike Levitz. I will say that the improvement in gross margin this quarter -- I would echo what Pat said -- is not related to us building inventory. So in terms of your first question about the gross margin levels, as I said in my earlier remarks, we expect that this is the new baseline for our business. And we also raised our target because of what we are seeing operationally -- both our target for this year and our expectations for this year and also our longer-term target. In terms of inventory balance in your second question about, you know, is this the -- what we should expect at the inventory level, one of the things that we have been doing, first of all, is what Pat said, which is rebuilding the inventory to levels that we are comfortable with for regular -- I mean, we've got dramatically growing demand. And so we need to make sure that we have the supply for that. But in addition to that, Pat talked about one initiative to drive gross margin improvement, and that being the move from air freight to ocean freight. And in order to do that, essentially you have a warehouse on the water, if you will, that you need to stock for. So as we make that transition to driving these gross margin improvements, we do expect that we will be building inventory for that initiative. But I think that's a specific initiative, and that's the basis for the build as we go into the upcoming portion of the year. And now, obviously, we have upcoming product launches and other things that we've been talking about. Patrick Sullivan : And just -- Mike, when you think about this, it's basically last year -- at this time last year we had about 30 days on hand, and just right now we have about 30 days on hand of finished goods inventory. We had to dip down in the back half of last year due to the Field Safety Notifications and the recall, which took us to lower inventory levels then. And now we're building back up and now getting to where essentially we were last year at this point in time. Looking forward to the end of the year, we want to have another month of inventory that we're going to have, so that we can go to the ocean and generate a point of gross margin as a result of that savings. Mike Weinstein : Okay. Is there inventory guidance, if you would, for the rest of the year? Michael Levitz : No, there is not. Mike Weinstein : Okay. I'll jump back in queue. I have some other questions, but I want to let some others jump in. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brooks West from Piper Jaffray. Brooks West : Shacey, you mentioned patient retention in your prepared remarks. I wonder if you'd give us updated thoughts on attrition rates. And I've asked this question in the past -- you know, you have set line of sight to maybe aspirational 7%, 8%. Just wonder if you've got updated thoughts on attrition rate, given the progress you have seen in the business? Shacey Petrovic : Yes, so we continue to make progress on new patient retention. And then the bigger nut for us in terms of the value it drives the organization is total retention for the installed base. And that just takes a little bit longer to see full results because of the year lagging. But the results are looking pretty encouraging halfway through the year. So that certainly seems to be contributing to the strong quarter we had this quarter, because our reorders -- which is one thing that we look for to signal retention -- were strong. So making progress on that longer-term goal of reducing attrition by 2%. Brooks West : Great. And then, Pat, we've talked about this privately, but I wanted to ask you the question on the call. We get questions -- and these are framed as concerns -- about your European distributor. That contract is coming up for renewal. And without tipping your hand, I wonder a couple of things, when does that contract come up, and when might it be renegotiated? If you were to have to take that geography direct, I'm wondering if you could talk conceptually about what that would entail, and then the kind of cost benefit versus -- you know, the margin you would receive versus the money you'd have to spend to do that. Thanks. Patrick Sullivan : We have been -- we are very pleased with the relationship we've had Ypsomed, to be specific on the contract that expires mid-2018, and we will get together with Ypsomed probably early next year to talk about the agreement. We would love to continue the relationship with Ypsomed going forward. But we are evaluating all of our options and opportunities to provide patients in Europe the best delivery system that we possibly can. I think it's premature for us to talk about what an alternative plan would be, because we're not in that frame of mind right now. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew from William Blair. Ben Andrew : Maybe talk a little bit about, Shacey, what the bottleneck is now? Because obviously you guys have broken through with new patient adds, retention, productivity of the reps. Where are you seeing the constraints on the business? And is the mix of patients changing in terms of where they are coming from, whether MDI or existing pumpers? Shacey Petrovic : Those are great questions, Ben. I would say the mix is not changing. So we still see, depending on the quarter, anywhere from 70% to 80% of our new users coming from multiple daily injection patients, which is why we are focused so heavily there. In terms of the bottlenecks, when we think about when we might expand sales force, for example, we think about things like market access -- so Medicare, continuing to increase Medicaid access are two things that could really make a difference for our business. And then I would say the other piece of it is really about the insulin capacity of the pod. And it's one of the reasons why we've invested in the concentrated insulins is because it enables us to serve people who have higher insulin requirements, daily requirements. And so that opens up -- as I said, it doubles our potential market. So those are really, to me, the two big areas. I think we're going to continue to see great growth. We certainly have a lot of opportunity in front of us. Today, when we think about market share, we think of market share of total people in the United States living with Type 1 diabetes. We probably have a 4%, maybe approaching 5%, share. So even with some of the market access opportunities before us in concentrated insulins, we have a lot of runway and, I think, a lot of great growth ahead of us. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. Jayson Bedford : Nice job on the progress; you guys are doing a good job. Just a couple questions. In the US, is there any way you can give us a new patient growth number in the quarter? Meaning -- it's tough to get to your US number without a new patient add number that implies growth well north of 20%. So I'm also a little surprised you're not lifting your expectation for 20% growth in new patients in the installed base. Shacey Petrovic : Well, we did have a record growth number, as I indicated, but it's in line with our forecasted expectations of 20% growth. And the reason, Jayson, we don't give it is because it just seems like it could be misleading. At the end of the day, the numbers only represent 10% or less of our revenue in any given quarter. And so because of the recurring revenue model, really retention contributes as well as new patient growth. And so it's not a great indicator. But it is an indicator of where things are going in the future, and for that we are really excited. We had a record growth in terms of new patient starts. And we are on track for 20% growth year-over-year of our US new patients as well as our installed base. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy from Jefferies. Raj Denhoy : I wonder if I could ask just a couple of broader questions. You know, we saw United Healthcare decision -- I think it was this quarter. Obviously, it didn't impact you, but I'm curious your thoughts on the possibility for similar types of programs, some other payors -- how that might impact your business going forward? Shacey Petrovic : Sure. So you're right; the United Healthcare decision didn't impact OmniPod. But earlier this year we had increased our -- the size of our market access team, mainly because we knew we were going to be arming them with really solid clinical data that they could go to the payors with. And so we've had discussions with all of our major payors. And we don't see this as a trend. We don't anticipate that other large payors are going to be taking Omni's preferred provider arrangement. Patrick Sullivan : And we believe that the choice of what insulin delivery system a patient chooses should be a decision made by the physician, not the insurance company. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen and Company. Ryan Blicker : Hi, this is Ryan Blicker in for Doug. Thanks for taking my questions. Thank you for all the color on the gross margins and the exciting initiative you have ongoing. Can you give us a sense of how you're thinking about the time frame for your new 65% gross margin target, and maybe how sensitive this target is to drug delivery revenue? For instance, I know this isn't your expectation, but if for some reason drug delivery revenue did not grow in 2017 and 2018, do you still think that level of gross margin or something close to it is still achievable? Michael Levitz : This is Mike. So as one of the previous questions referenced, our prior stated goal was 60%, and now we have raised it to 65%. And when we laid out the 60% goal, that was over a multiyear period of time. And the same is true with the 65% target. What we have said is that we have clear line of sight to it. But these activities take a lot of work, and they take time. They take continued investment. In terms of the impact of drug delivery on that particular metric, I wouldn't say that it has an outsized impact on it. The initiatives Pat have described and that we've talked in part about before are really operational in nature and not related to mix. There are puts and takes on the mix side. Our international business, and principally our distributors, I should say; not as much international business -- but our international distributors tend to have a lower contribution margin, whereas drug delivery tends to have a higher. So there is somewhat of an offset as we've seen outsized growth in both of those areas. So mix is -- I wouldn't say it's not a contributor at all, but it's not the driving force behind us achieving these targets. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Suraj Kalia from Northland Securities. Suraj Kalia : So, Patrick, a lot of the questions have been asked. Let me see if I can dig into a couple of other areas. I'm sure you saw the recent CRL letter for Novartis's Neulasta biosimilar. One would think the CRL and the delay thereof at least would provide a temporary positive environment for Amgen and, thereof, to you guys. I guess where I'm headed with this, Patrick, is, does your contract with Amgen -- is it exclusive? Does it prevent you all to talking with other players? And does that flow through other areas, also, whether it's Lilly or any other players in terms of biosimilars? Patrick Sullivan : Dan, would you like to take that one? Dan Levangie : Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. I would say we'd rather not comment on specific details of our agreement with Amgen. I would echo your sentiment, however, that the CRL that was issued for the Neulasta biosimilar -- we see that as very good news, frankly, for our business. You know, the adoption of this combination product since February of last year has really been dramatic and above expectations, and we see that continuing going forward. It's really remarkable convenience for these patients who are undergoing chemotherapy. So we think the runway has been plectant, and there is a degree of excitement, both at Insulet and at Amgen, that we've got a longer runway to convert the market. So we're working together to achieve that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Robert Baird. Jeff Johnson : Congratulations on the quarter. Shacey, I was hoping I could ask you a couple pipeline questions. On the AP front, can you put any goalposts out there as far as maybe timelines for IDE, pivotal timing, things like that? And then, would it be a combined kind of PlGF and hyper combined study, or are you going to go stepwise? I think I have asked you that question before, but just want to confirm that. And then my last question on that whole side would just be -- Pat, from a manufacturing standpoint, are you doing anything going forward to make sure you're maybe manufacturing under class III protocols, and you would be able to upgrade, let's say, the next-generation system that will be integrated with G5 to a G6 with just a software push or anything? Any changes there on the manufacturing front that will kind of facilitate these upgrades over time? Patrick Sullivan : Yes, very good question on the PMA requirements. I am very familiar with PMA requirements. My previous company was -- we got four PMAs approved in 23 supplements. So very much up to speed on what the requirements are. Mike -- Michael Spears, our VP of Quality, has a goal this year to provide a plan that we will start implementing next year to get all of the quality systems up to PMA standard in time for the launch of the -- in of time for the FDA inspection of the facility as well as the quality system to be able to launch the AP system on time. So we know what we need to do, and we've got to put in a plan in place to do it. And we'll just make it happen. Shacey Petrovic : And in terms -- I think you asked about the AP milestones. Our IDE, as I mentioned, the on-body trial is our first IDE. And we expect to be entering that later on this fall. We're very excited. We've got a terrific group of investigators, really the best of the best, working on this with us. So we're excited about being able to make quick progress there. And in terms of functionality of our system, we don't want to give too much away, but I think I have said to you before that we definitely will have more than predictive low glucose suspend. We're not anticipating taking that sort of incremental step. We really want to bring value to the market when we launch. So that's our goal. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Rose from Canaccord. Kyle Rose : I echo the sentiments on the strong quarter, so congrats on that. Just one quick question; a lot has already been asked. But wondered if you could talk through some of the initiatives that you are doing to drive the improvements in retention in the underlying installed base? I understand the focus on the new patients in the beginning, but kind of walk us through how the installed base is different from a longer-term perspective, and what you as a company can control and try to help improve those retention rates? Shacey Petrovic : Sure. There are, really, I think, two primary things that drive retention. And probably the most important driver that we can control is the product quality and our product experience. So a lot of our efforts are focused on ensuring that -- you know, the product quality and product experience have, one, to do with product quality; and then, second, to do with how competent and confident the user is in managing with their OmniPod. The things like the Podder platform, the app, and some marketing -- ongoing marketing, communications, and support that we have to our user base help with the competency and comfort level of the users. And then, as Pat has mentioned many times, we just have a tremendous cross-functional Company focus on product quality and the customer experience that comes from product quality. So we've made great strides on that. I think both of those two things are the main things driving retention. The other piece is market access. So as we gain in Medicaid and even Medicare, when that comes, all of that will help us also continue to improve attrition of the broader installed base -- I mean, retention, rather, of the broader installed base. Kyle Rose : Just one other one, just to circle back on the sales and marketing within OpEx, I understand that you made a lot of investments last year ahead of when you're expecting those revenues to flow through. We are obviously seeing that in the first half. But just when you think about the number in the Q2 here, should we consider that a floor and a base to move from moving forward? Or is there anything one-time in nature that we should -- that would change how we think about sales and marketing line in this quarter? Michael Levitz : This is Mike. There was nothing unusual in the numbers in the quarter. There weren't any unusual expenses or favorability. So I think that it's a fair run rate, but what I would say is there are a number of investments that we are making in terms of new product development. Shacey talked about a number of areas that we are very excited about, and with Bluetooth pods, and the concentrated insulin, and everything else. So there's a good amount of expense that can be variable in nature, depending on the timing of work performed on some of those key projects. So we do expect that there will be continued expense as we go through the year and continued investment. But no, there were no unusual items in the quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Mike Weinstein : We covered a lot of ground. I just wanted to make sure I understood the product that you're planning to introduce at ADA next year. You talked about just the upgraded connectivity. Could you just spend a minute on that, Shacey? Thanks. Shacey Petrovic : Sure. And we'll give more color -- we're planning to give a lot more color at the investor day in November. But what this system involves is a Bluetooth PDM, a Bluetooth pod, and an app that would reside on the user's mobile phone. And that app -- we call it internally our PDM app. So it would display key information from a user's mobile phone, like insulin on board, like last bolus. And that app would integrate with Dexcom's app in order to provide integration of G5 data as well. So what we've heard loud and clear from our users is they want more functionality and more data on their phone. This system will provide that. And the Bluetooth platform gives us a lot of opportunity for continuing and hopefully accelerated product development as we look over the horizon. So we view this Bluetooth platform as a platform for our artificial pancreas and also, frankly, as a platform for our artificial -- I'm sorry, our concentrated insulins launches as well. So I will give you more detail on kind of the specifics of the features of the product in our investor day and as we progress towards the end of the year. Operator : We have a follow-up question from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen and Company. Ryan Blicker : Going back to OpEx, we don't have the exact depreciation number yet, but it does appear as though you were EBITDA-positive in the quarter. Is it fair to expect that that trend will continue through the rest of the year? Thank you. Michael Levitz : This is Mike. As I said, in terms of -- so we talked about our revenue growth for the year, and we've talked about our expectations of gross margin. On the OpEx side, we do expect to be making additional investments through the remainder of the year. We're really excited about our outlook going forward and want to make sure, as we did last year when we decided we were going to make some key investments to drive the growth in the top line, growth in gross margin, ultimately our pathway to profitability, that we will continue to be doing that. So there are a number of initiatives that we've talked about on this call and we've talked about the past, and there is some timing of those things. And so I do expect that there will be continued investment through the latter half of this year. But we're very pleased with our direction in EBITDA, and we're very pleased with our direction in the pathway to profitability. Operator : I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Pat Sullivan. Patrick Sullivan : Thank you, operator. Let me just finish where I started. I am just absolutely thrilled with the progress and the performance of the Company during the last quarter. We are starting to show the impact of all the investments we've made. I must admit, however, that it hasn't been easy. But it's been accomplished by a dedicated team of talented individuals working from dawn to dusk to accomplish our objectives. We have a tremendous opportunity before us but significant work to do. So I'd like to end with a big thank you to all Insulet employees for a terrific job well done. Thank you. We'll talk to you in 90 days. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

(Broker) Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Insulet Corporation Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Deborah R. Gordon - Insulet Corp.: Thank you and good afternoon and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2016 earnings call. Joining me today are Patrick Sullivan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Shacey Petrovic, President and Chief Operating Officer; Michael Levitz, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Daniel Levangie, President, Drug Delivery. The replay of this call will be archived on our website. Our press release discussing our third quarter 2016 results and fourth quarter and full year 2016 guidance is also available in the IR section of our website. Before we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to be materially different from any future results implied by such statements. Such factors include those referenced in our Safe Harbor statement, in our third quarter earnings release and in the company's filings with the SEC. With that, let me turn the call over to Pat. Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: Thank you, Deb, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin with a brief review of our third quarter performance and recent business highlights and then Mike will discuss our financial results and provide our fourth quarter and full year guidance. Shacey will provide an update on our exciting commercial and R&D progress. Dan will then give us an update on our Drug Delivery business. We'll then turn the call over for questions. Before we get started, I'd like to first recognize November as National Diabetes Awareness Month. We're very proud of what we do every day to simplify life for people with diabetes by providing them with an easy-to-use and convenient technology to control their diabetes. We took part in the Closing Bell Ringing Ceremony at NASDAQ on November the 1 to continue to raise diabetes awareness. I'm once again thrilled with Insulet's continued strong performance in all aspects of our business. Our momentum this year remains very strong. And our team is making significant progress on all of our key initiatives in every facet of our business. As a result of this strong performance and our confidence in the future, we are raising our full year revenue guidance $13 million to $363 million at the midpoint, up from our previous midpoint guidance of $350 million, a growth of 38% year-over-year. Our gross margin continues to improve to 58.6%. We're reporting strong and impressive financial results in all product lines for the third quarter. Total revenue grew 30% year-over-year with total revenue of $95 million and $5.5 million higher than the midpoint of our guidance range. Third quarter U.S. Omnipod revenue was nearly $60 million, representing a strong 18% year-over-year growth. International Omnipod revenue of $19 million was stronger than we expected, primarily due to growth in existing markets and significant traction in new markets, particularly France. Our Drug Delivery revenue was approximately $16 million, was also above our expectations. As you know, a large portion of this business includes sales to Amgen for its Neulasta Onpro kit, which continues to gain adoption in the United States. Amgen noted on its earnings call last week that the Onpro kit now represents between 44% and 45% conversion of its Neulasta business and they expect to finish this year around 50%. I'm very proud of the team's tremendous accomplishments. We're growing our top-line and making thoughtful investments in the business, while ever mindful of our profitability goals. We are focused on driving and delivering meaningful innovation to our customers that we believe will leapfrog competition. As Shacey will describe, we had another study published last month demonstrating the significant quality of life benefits of Omnipod. We will continue to invest in clinical studies and publications to continue to build the bibliography of scientific evidence, demonstrating the clinical and economic benefits of Omnipod to physicians, payers and patients. We made significant improvements during the first half of this year and continued in this quarter in our manufacturing operations global supply chain logistics. This improved efficiency resulted in gross margins of 58.6% in the third quarter, up over 14 percentage points versus Q3 of last year and sequentially from last quarter. This performance improvement was due in part to increased daily output with fewer head count as well as reduction in scrap. These improved efficiency drives not only reduced costs but also improve quality of the product. We remain on track to achieve our gross margins of 65% or greater over the coming years and have a clear line of sight to get there. The manufacturing and operations team are doing a great job and executing on our key initiatives of improving; number one, our operating efficiency and yield in the factory; number two, our supply chain by providing for redundancy at a reduced cost; and three, our logistics and distribution efficiencies to further reduce costs. In September, we announced plans to establish an automated manufacturing operation in the United States with production beginning in 2019. This investment will provide redundancy and additional capacity to support our growth. We expect this highly automated operation to be a meaningful contributor to push our gross margins to 65% and higher. We're very excited with this new phase of our manufacturing and operation strategy. And we'll provide you with additional details during our November 16 Investor Day. We'll also provide detail on the technology progress we're making on our innovation roadmap, including our plans to introduce a truly differentiated mobile system at next year's ADA and, following that, a best-in-class automated glucose control system. We will also discuss our pathway to profitability and our long-term plans to achieve $1 billion in top-line revenue. Finally, I'd like to briefly discuss the changes within our senior management team that we recently announced. I'd like to congratulate Shacey on her well-deserved promotion to President and COO. Shacey has made a tremendous impact since joining Insulet in February of 2015 and through her commercial leadership delivered record results. In her new role, Shacey work closely with me to further improve our operational capabilities and capitalize on our new growth opportunities. Her responsibilities will also include the Drug Delivery product line. Also Dan Levangie has decided to retire from his position with Insulet at the end of this year. Dan has been with Insulet for over five years, first as a member of the board of directors and then as part of our senior leadership team. I'd like to personally thank Dan for his contributions to Insulet over the years, particularly his efforts to advance our Drug Delivery business and set us up for continued success. He will remain with the company through the end of this year to assist with an effective transition and has agreed to remain available to Insulet in a consulting role. With that, let me turn the call over to Mike. Mike? Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: Thank you, Pat. I will review the third quarter 2016 results and then introduce our fourth quarter and updated full year guidance. Our prior year results for comparative purposes exclude Neighborhood Diabetes which we divested in February of this year. As I review our results, unless otherwise stated, all commentary regarding changes will be on a year-over-year basis. We're very pleased to report third quarter revenue growth of 33%, with revenue of $94.9 million compared to $71.4 million. All three of our product lines contributed meaningfully to this increase. Our results this past quarter once again demonstrated significant growth, driven by the success of the ongoing commercial initiatives within our U.S. diabetes business, rapid volume growth internationally and strong growth in Drug Delivery. We exceeded the midpoint of our stated guidance by over $5 million, primarily due to strong demand for Omnipod from a growing installed base in the United States and existing markets in Europe, as well as higher-than-expected penetration in new markets such as France, with the remainder driven by continued strong adoption of the Neulasta Onpro system. Our gross margin increased to 58.6%, up over 14 points from 44.2% and higher than our expectation as our investments in improving manufacturing and supply chain efficiency and effectiveness, as well as improving the overall product quality are paying off. The improvement compared to last year reflect $7.7 million of costs in the third quarter of last year associated with products that did not meet our quality expectation, which negatively impacted prior year third quarter gross margin by nine points. The remainder of the year-over-year improvement was due to the supply chain operations improvements that we've made in 2016. We expect our gross margin for the remainder of this year to be in line with the third quarter. And, therefore, we now expect gross margin for the full year to be in the upper 50%s, up from our previous guidance of mid to upper 50%. We're also confident in achieving our longer-term stated goal of gross margin of 65% or higher. Operating expenses increased to $53 million compared to $46 million, half of which was due to increased research and development costs related to our innovation projects. The other half was primarily due to investments in 2015 and 2016, expanding our commercial and operational infrastructure in support of continued strong growth from our commercial strategy. With the significant growth in both revenue and gross profit, we generated operating income of $2.4 million compared to a loss of $14.8 million. We're very pleased with the growth in gross profit and sustainable positive EBIT is within our control, impacted by the level and timing of planned investments. Consistent with what we've said previously to drive near-term and longer-term value creation, we plan to continue to make substantial investments in product development, clinical data, commercial expansion and operating improvement. And, therefore, we do not plan to be in a sustainable positive EBIT position before 2018, though individual quarters may be above breakeven depending on the timing of expenses. We ended the quarter with $283 million in cash and investments, compared to $123 million at the end of 2015. The increase in our cash balance was driven by our successful private placement of 1.25% convertible notes in the principal amount of $345 million, offset primarily by the repurchase of a portion of our existing 2% convertible notes in the principal amount of $134 million, as well as equipment purchases to support our U.S. manufacturing initiatives and an increase in inventory to support our growth and our initiative to move from air freight to ocean freight during 2017. We are very pleased with our financial position coming out of the third quarter and the stability provided as we make these strategic investments in support of our near-term and longer-term growth opportunities. I'll now walk through our outlook for the remainder of 2016. Given our better than expected third quarter revenue and the continued strong momentum in our commercial business, we're raising our full year revenue guidance. We now anticipate full year revenue in the range of $362 million to $365 million, up approximately $13 million at the midpoint from our previous range at $345 million to $355 million. This compares to 2015 revenue of $264 million and represents growth of approximately 38% at the midpoint. The raise in our guidance factors in our strong third quarter performance, our expectation for continued global Omnipod growth in both existing markets and new markets, and the retirement of risk as we're now closer to year-end than when we last gave you guidance, which has resulted in our tightening our fourth quarter revenue range. We expect strong annual year-over-year growth across our business lines, with U.S. Omnipod growth of approximately 20%, up from our previous guidance of upper teens; international Omnipod growth of approximately 80%, up from our previous guidance of 65%; and Drug Delivery growth of approximately 90%, which represents $4 million more than our previous expectations. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $99 million to $102 million compared to $83.8 million, representing growth of approximately 20% at the midpoint. This is driven by Omnipod revenue in the United States of between $61 million and $62 million, representing mid-teens growth on a percentage basis; international revenue of $20 million to $21 million, representing growth of approximately 35%; and Drug Delivery revenue of $18 million to $19 million representing growth of approximately 25%. We look forward to providing you additional color on our progress and our long-term outlook at our upcoming Investor Day on November 16. We also look forward to sharing with you in greater detail our pathway to $1 billion in revenue, gross margin of 65% or higher and the main drivers of our near-term profitability target of being sustainably EBIT positive beginning in 2018 and our longer-term drivers of profitability expansion. With that, I will now turn the call over to Shacey. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Thanks, Mike. Consistent with the first half of this year, we are converting market opportunity at record rate. And in Q3, we continued to deliver strong revenue and new patient growth. We're on track to grow our 2016 worldwide installed base by 20% and generate approximately 20% growth in our U.S. new patient starts, consistent with our previous guidance. The growth we've seen in new users and the significant loyalty in our existing customer base of Podders is driven by Omnipod's truly unique technology and its ability to simplify and improve the lives of people living with insulin-dependent diabetes. This quarter we achieved yet another record-setting number of new patient starts in both the U.S. and international markets. And I'm confident that this momentum will carry us through to a strong finish for the year. The four key drivers of Omnipod's growth have remained consistent throughout the year : first, targeted clinical messaging and a growing body of data demonstrating the benefits of Omnipod, particularly for multiple daily injection users; second, strong adoption of tools like Insulet Provided Glooko and our Omnipod customer mobile app, which improve training and support for our clinics and patients; third, our focus on a world-class customer experience; and fourth, continued strength in our international markets. First, our targeted clinical messaging. We continue to grow our body of clinical evidence supporting the many benefits of Omnipod in addition to the six presentations at the ADA scientific sessions in June of this year and two subsequent publications of compelling clinical studies demonstrating the benefits of Omnipod. Just this last month, Dr. William Polonsky's manuscript, Impact of Omnipod Insulin Management System on Quality of Life, was published in Diabetes Technology & Therapeutics. This study included more than 1,200 current adult Omnipod users with type 1 diabetes. They completed a questionnaire designed to examine perceived changes in quality of life and glycemic control of Omnipod versus their previous insulin delivery system which included both MDI and traditional tubed pump. The key findings of this study are fully impressive. The vast majority of patients reported significant improvements in quality of life, glycemic control and diabetes distress with 73% of study participants reporting an improvement in perceived control over their diabetes and 70% reporting a reduction in diabetes distress. This data is a remarkable testament to the power of Omnipod to reduce the burden of diabetes and to dramatically improve quality of life. The second growth driver, our Digital Insulet program, including Insulet Provided Glooko and our Omnipod mobile app, is also increasing customer satisfaction. Our Omnipod mobile app has been downloaded about 8,000 times. And we now have more than 22,000 Omnipod users using Insulet Provided Glooko, which enables insight into diabetes management for these users and their care teams. These easy-to-use tools are being rapidly adopted because they deliver improved training and support for our customers and clinicians. Third, we remain committed to providing an exceptional customer experience. To continue to raise the bar, we are now measuring and driving improvement on all facets of the customer Insulet interaction, including product support, customer service, and new patient training. I'm very pleased to report strong results with customers rating us a 95% in overall satisfaction with customer care. And, finally, we continue to experience exciting growth in our international markets. And we, once again, experienced higher than expected demand in a number of markets, including France and Canada. The international opportunities for Omnipod are enormous and offer near-term and long-term growth potential. There is widespread clinical evidence and acceptance that continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion provides improved short-term and long-term outcomes versus multiple daily injections. Despite this, across the United States and Europe, less than 30% of people living with type 1 diabetes are using pumps. Market research clearly demonstrates that this is because traditional pumps are extremely complex with steep learning curves and the thought of being tethered to a pump deters people from switching from MDI. So while the insulin pump market is becoming more fragmented and competitive, we remain focused on our MDI customer segment, those people who want the benefits of continuous insulin infusion, but do not want to adopt traditional tube pump. As we've heard this week, there is competitive noise in the marketplace. And while we've observed this dynamic, it appears that this has had a more significant impact on other traditional tube pump companies. In fact, it seems to have had little impact on our leading indicators. And, of course, our business model offers unique protection. Omnipod's target market and value proposition are unique. And there are many reasons why traditional tube pumps, including 670G, are not serious or sustainable obstacles to Omnipod's growth opportunities. As we've stated many times, we are laser-focused on new patient starts coming from multiple daily injection patients, not from patients already using competitive pump. This is the most significant remaining market opportunity and it is the market segment in which simplicity and convenience of Omnipod resonates most clearly. The bottom-line is that in spite of the recent noise in the market, we believe we will continue to grow at 20% year-over-year by converting these MDI patients to a more effective treatment for their disease. Just last week, we held a Scientific Advisory Board during the Canada Diabetes Association annual meeting. A number of distinguished endocrinologists participated to provide feedback and guidance on our product development and clinical strategies. Two quotes from that meeting struck me as encapsulating Omnipod's value. One physician said to us \"if Omnipod had been first on the market, the tubed pump would never have existed\". The second sentiment expressed in a number of ways from these physicians was that people living with the burden of diabetes are not seeking more complex technology. What they really want is less work. Omnipod's differentiated technology along with our exciting product pipelines do just that, reduce burden and simplify life. Along with commercial execution progress, we've made significant progress on our innovation roadmap. And we are thrilled to have an opportunity in a couple of weeks at our Investor Day to unveil some of the exciting features of our new technology platform. As we previously shared, we will deliver a Bluetooth connectivity platform that will provide our customers with more data and functionality on their mobile phones. The first steps along our Digital Insulet pathway were Insulet Provided Glooko and our Omnipod mobile app. And we are strongly encouraged by the adoption rate and the excitement that our users have for this new technology. Our research and development and commercial teams are continuing to work diligently to deliver an innovative new system. And we remain on track to debut this platform at ADA in San Diego next year. We will have more to share with you in a couple of weeks, including a demonstration of the new platform. But, for now, I'll say that we are very excited about offering even more ease-of-use and simplicity for our Podders. This next-gen mobile system is the platform for our artificial pancreas program and the program's first product, our Omnipod Horizon Automated Glucose Control System. We have now completed our first IDE trial and performance of our algorithm was very strong as we predicted. The FDA just approved our second phase IDE, which will evaluate our algorithm performance in adolescents and pediatric patient. We anticipate completing this study before the end of the year. And we are thrilled to have the leadership of our new medical director, Dr. Trang Ly, over this important development program. Trang joined from us Stanford University and she's been involved in research for all of the major artificial pancreas trials and systems. She has a deep expertise in acceleration and successful completion of AP clinical development. She's already making quite an impact on our AP program and really other clinical development programs here at Insulet. We also worked with Lily to complete enrollment for our U-500 clinical trial this quarter. This program, along with its sister program, to deliver Lily's U-200 out of the pod are on track. As a reminder, concentrated insulin with Omnipod is a particularly attractive opportunity for us. U-200 and U-500 effectively increase the capacity of our reservoir and enable Omnipod to better serve people with higher insulin requirements such as people living with insulin dependent type 2 diabetes. Omnipod U-500 and Omnipod U-200 will double our addressable market. Our innovative product development pipeline is making exciting progress and will accelerate adoption of Omnipod over the next few years and will drive long-term sustainable and profitable growth. We're very proud to see the team's hard work over the last two years begin to pay off. It's really an honor and a thrill to be a part of this passionate team that's so well-positioned to provide our shareholders with increased value while significantly improving the lives of people living with insulin-dependent diabetes. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dan. Daniel J. Levangie - Insulet Corp.: Thanks, Shacey. As we reported earlier, we've had another very strong quarter performance in our Drug Delivery business. As reported by Amgen, the Onpro system continues to be adopted by oncologists and oncology clinics throughout the United States and the professional and consumer campaigns being conducted by Amgen are clearly being effective. Third quarter Drug Delivery revenue was $16 million and we believe we're on track for full year 2016 revenue of approximately $64 million. Our business development team in the field continues to make inroads in their discussions with additional Drug Delivery partners. And I'm very pleased with our progress in building a pipeline of projects that will generate growth for our business. As Pat announced earlier, I've made the decision to transition out of my position with Insulet at the end of this year. I've been involved with Insulet now for five years, having joined the company as a member of the Insulet board in late 2011 and transitioning into a full-time operating position two years ago. As I reflect on the last five years, I'm very proud of the progress we've made in establishing Insulet as a growth company serving so many patients with life-saving products. And I look forward to working with Shacey to complete a smooth transition. I'll also be available to Pat and the team in a consulting role as the need for my assistance dictates. I'd like to thank all of our employees, our customers and our investors for your support of our efforts during my tenure with the company. And, with that, I'll turn the call back to Pat. Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: Thanks, Dan. Operator, we'd like to now open the call up for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. Congrats on the quarter and, Dan, congrats on retirement. I feel like you're leaving as I arrived. So I'm trying not to take it personally. But two quick questions here. First, for Shacey maybe or Pat, the quarter guidance and the commentary suggest you're obviously seeing a little impact from this competitive channel dynamics that many are talking about. Are you seeing any impact, Shacey? And is there any reason to believe that your competitive insulation will change in anyway as you get closer to this competitor's launch? And then I had a quick follow-up on profitability. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Okay. So I would say we're really seeing very little impact. There's, of course, noise in the marketplace and customers are doing their research. But I think where we benefited that it's not the same target segment. 670 is very much focused on patients who are willing to wear a tubed pump, well controlled adults who are willing to put the work into get the incremental improvement with that system. And our target patient population, as we've talked about, I think, for many quarters now, is the multiple daily injection user and so we're targeted towards different segments. The other thing I would say is that, as you know, I'm sure, 670 is not approved for people 14 and younger. And it's actually black box in seven and younger. So the pediatric patient population, which is our fastest-growing segment, is not really eligible or appropriate for this technology. And as we get closer to this actually becoming available on the market, I actually would say that in that instance when people start to learn more about the technology, we're probably going to feel this a little bit less in the marketplace. But we are very confident in our growth and our opportunity and feeling good about the finish for this year and 2017. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Very helpful. And then, Mike, I guess I should ask you how it feels to make some money, but I'll ask a serious question. Margins have been, obviously, the investor surprise this year and gross margins, obviously, have been heading higher (29:38). But you've been driving dramatic leverage, right. I think this is the fourth straight quarter where operating expenses continue to fall. So, it sounds like based on your commentary, looking forward I think at some point we have to expect that operating expense growth to tick back up. Is that sort of a same assumption from these depressed levels? And then in terms of gross margins, I'm expecting ratable improvements from here into 2017 and beyond, but obviously not the step function we saw here in 2016. Thanks so much. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: Well, what I would say about profitability, yes, it was wonderful this quarter to be in positive EBIT territory. That's \u2013 as we've said before, we're almost familiar with being. (30:19) And we continue to expect to be positive in EBIT beginning in 2018. And as we've said before, it's within our control to move and be sustainably positive EBIT before then. But the opportunities in front of us with this product are significant. And when you think about the new product opportunities with the U200, U-500, our concentrated influence, which double our addressable market, in addition to the artificial pancreas and then the mobile Omnipod that precedes that, that we'll take more about at our Investor Day in the next couple weeks, these are very straightforward value creation opportunities from our perspective. And we want to make sure we make sufficient investments in the product development, in the clinical support and data, and in the commercial organization, operational organization, to drive that. So we will see an uptick in spending, but really mostly in those areas that I just described. As far as gross margin, we were pleased last quarter to say that we were at the new normal level and we've improved from, there really principally driven by improvements in yield, production effectiveness and efficiency with really driving down the amount of labor we've needed to use. We'll give more clarity around the gross margin improvements, but on the pathway to 65% and higher gross margins, we will be making regular improvements in that. And there are some different drivers along the way that we'll talk more about in a couple weeks at Investor Day, like the U.S. manufacturing and otherwise, but we're not waiting for that. We continue to expect regular improvements in gross margins. Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: Investing for growth. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks so much. Thanks, Pat. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brooks West with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hi. Can you hear me? Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: We got you, Brooks. Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great. Thanks, Pat. Congratulations on a great quarter. I had kind of a follow-up question on the market influence of 670G, maybe looking at it from a different direction. I think there's a perception on the Street that maybe the Omnipod is sometimes looked at as a starter pump on a progression from a patient to a more complex technology. So I'm wondering, Shacey or Pat, if you'd comment on that. And then as you look at your attrition rate and where those patients go after Omnipod, I'm wondering, do you have a sense for are they progressing to a tubed pump? Are they dropping off pump therapy? That would be a helpful clarification. And then I've got a follow-up. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. I would say \u2013 I think that's a great characterization of our technology. We are very much the pump that patients from MDI go to. And we're able to get people to transition from MDI therapy to pump therapy just because of Omnipod's form factor and its simplicity and ease-of-use. And so, I think, that's a great way to describe us. And, in fact, we've got a fairly strong retention rate and loyalty in our customer base. So, remember, in any given time period, we really only have 9% of patients falloff the product. And of those, I wouldn't say we see transition to tubed pumps. When people get used to relying on a system that isn't tethered and gives them that freedom of life and that ability to exercise and sleep and run busy lives with that freedom, they generally don't want to move to a tethered product. Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. That's helpful. And I was hoping you were going to say a lower attrition rate but you still said the 9%. Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: Well, half of that, Brooks, is due to the economics and product performance. And we're making improvements in all of those to really improve the attrition rate. So it's an area we're focused on by improved market access and in our manufacturing to continuously improve product quality. Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. That's helpful. And then my follow-up was on the Lilly. I thought I heard you say that Lilly finished the trial for the U-500. I wanted to make sure if that was correct. And then does that \u2013 we've been speculating on a product timeline to market; it maybe late 2017 or early 2018. Does that fit? I know that's not 100% in your control, but it feels like maybe the trial got done a little bit earlier than we thought. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Well, I should clarify. So thanks for giving me that opportunity. We finished enrollment. So the trial will go actually through the better part of next year. So we really are looking \u2013 projecting this to be late 2018, 2019 in terms of market entry. Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Got it, okay. Thanks so much. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. And I'll add my congratulations. I apologize if I missed this. We have four earnings calls happening at the same time, so it's hard to catch everything. But I just wanted to come back to a couple of your comments. So, one, you said that \u2013 are you on track for 20% growth in U.S. new patient starts this year? Two, Shacey, I thought I heard you say that the bottom-line is that despite the recent noise, we believe, continue to grow at 20% year-over-year. And I just wanted to clarify, we're you talking about U.S. new patients starts next year or were you talking about revenues? Maybe just clarify that? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then just the third item is, could you just talk about the cash raise? Because now you have a lot more cash, obviously, more debt too than you had previously. How much of that is going to the facility investments you're making and is there anything else you're planning on doing with it? Thanks. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yes. I'll take the first two and then I'll punt to Mike for the third one. So, we are very much on track for 20% growth in new patient starts in the United States. And when I was reefing to 20% growth, I just meant global new patients. I wasn't referring to revenue. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: And with regards to the cash raise, so we ended up with a net cash raise of about $180 million, because we used the $345 million of new notes, which were at a wonderfully low coupon of 1.25%. We used a portion to buy back two-thirds of our existing 2% note. So, net-net we ended with $180 the million and we intend to use that for the U.S. manufacturing investment and there's still roughly $67 million of the 2% notes out there. So, there's also the opportunity to consider buying back some of those over time. And as we talked about, there are a number of opportunities across the business to make investments. And we want to make sure that we're not really thinking about the cash when we're doing that. So that's how we intend to use the cash. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Let me just clarify a couple items. So, Shacey, on the 20%, obviously, in light of the activity in all of the diabetes stocks over the last week and really last month or so, just want to clarify your view on the sustainability of new patient starts in the U.S. I don't think people are really worried about outside the U.S., particularly in the back what's happening in France for you guys. So can you just give us your view on the sustainability of the growth rates we're seeing in new patient starts in the U.S.? And then just maybe one last question for Mike and then I'll drop. Just the inventory levels continue to rise here to new levels that we weren't expecting. Could you just talk about where those are headed? I know you're trying to support this transition from air freight to ocean freight but could you set expectations? Thank you. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure, Mike. We believe that the growth is eminently sustainable. I don't know how else to say it. I think there is noise in the marketplace but that's our job to clarify and educate around the noise. And we believe we have a very unique value opposition that's targeted towards a different segment of the market, people that are relying on multiple daily injections today. And that is not an appropriate segment to transition to a product creating this competitive noise in the market. Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: Yes. And I would just add, Mike, that I think as evidence of our confidence in our diabetes business, we are raising guidance $13 million at the midpoint. And that's across all business lines, international, Drug Delivery and U.S. diabetes. So we're very confident of our ability to continue to grow the diabetes business in the U.S. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: And this is Mike. With regards to your question on inventory levels, the growth in inventory is exactly as we planned and as we expected. This is entirely consistent with what we talked about making sure we have enough product for the transition to the lower cost mode of transportation with ocean freight as well as supporting the growth of the business. So in terms of expectations, I really don't \u2013 we don't expect it to grow a whole lot more as we get into year-end. But as we're making these transitions, this is what we believe is the level that we're comfortable at the support of the growing demand. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tao Levy with Wedbush. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Congratulations on a great quarter. Just maybe I could ask about the Lilly program. Is it possible that we can see that data presented at next year's ADA? It seems like it has completed enrollment early. It's 27-week follow-up. Is that in the realm? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: I think it's possible, but it is Lily's clinical trial. So we'll certainly support them in getting this clinical data out into the community as quickly as possible. But it really is their data to collect, analyze, and publish when they see fit. Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. And as a follow-up, you spoke very specifically about the OUS opportunity as being huge. Outside of Europe, is there a strategy in place? Is there a plan that you can go after? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: There is a strategy in place in terms of geographic expansion over the long-term with the business. But our focus in the more near-term is on U.S., Canada and Europe. But I would say even within Europe, we are not by any means fully penetrated or even half the way penetrated into the countries with opportunity in Europe. So, we see a tremendous opportunity just in terms of expansion in Europe. And then beyond that, of course, there are attractive markets across the globe that would benefit from Omnipod. So that's a longer-term plan I would say. But in the near-term, we really see great opportunity for continued growth within the MDI segment here and abroad. And also with our partner, with Ypsomed in Europe and across those markets, both in our existing markets to continue to grow, but also in terms of market expansion across Europe. Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: And do you help Ypsomed on that market expansion in Europe or is that really on their responsibilities? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: It's their responsibility from a commercial standpoint. We do the development work to be able to enter into new markets and the regulatory work to be able to enter into new markets. And, of course, we do market research with key opinion leaders to get input into our product development and clinical plans. But in terms of entering into a market and the commercial activities, that's primarily Ypsomed. Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy with Leerink Partners. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC : Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question and congratulations on an excellent quarter. Guys, I just wanted to ask you pretty high level. Sorry, if I missed this. I'm also on a few earnings calls at once. But just the diabetes market as a whole, I mean a few tough quarters for some of the competitive diabetes companies. J&J called out a difficult quarter in their \u2013 actually specifically in their pump business, but, of course, the strip business, Tandem, also, Dexcom called out some noise around the competition. What are you guys seeing in the market? I mean clearly you guys put up really great numbers. So is this something that you, Insulet, are just immune to or perhaps there are other factors that we're not considering that the market's actually still growing but maybe there are issues with those specific companies. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Danielle, I would say that we are somewhat immune to it just based on which market segment we're focused on, the fact that again we're focused on that MDI segment. Second of all, the pediatric patient population is such an important fast-growing component of our patient population. And that is not a population that will be eligible for or appropriate for competing products that we're talking about. And I think also the fact that we have geographically diverse revenue streams. And this is very much, I think, U.S. noise that's happening at this point. So I think we really have just been impacted less than some of the other companies out there. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: And Danielle, this is \u2013 I would just add that we have a recurring revenue model. And that is different from some of those other parties that you described. So it provides us a greater degree of stability. Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC : Understood. That's really helpful. So just a follow up on that. I mean do you see the pump market \u2013 is the insulin pump market growing and you guys are growing significantly faster than that or do you think the pump market has decelerated at all? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: I would say that we're growing fast and we're helping the pump market to grow. We don't really consider ourselves as taking share within the pump market. We're looking at the entire type 1 diabetes patient population. But we are definitely growing faster than the pump market but at least all market estimates are that the pump market is growing between 5% and 10% CAGR, annual CAGR at least in the United States. Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. Apologize if I missed this. But gross margins continue to be strong here. You signed the new manufacturing agreement with Flextronics during the quarter. Just wondering \u2013 are the economics more favorable to Insulet versus the old contract? And I'm wondering if that had an impact on gross margins over the last couple quarters. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: Jayson, it's Mike. What drove the improvements in gross margins was improvement in yield, the effectiveness for manufacturing, the quality with which we're doing it and efficiency with which we're doing it. Pat mentioned that we've been able to reduce head count while we've been growing daily volumes, while we've been reducing scrap and increasing yield. That's what's been driving the improvement. In terms of the arrangement with Flextronics, we're very pleased in September to renew that arrangement. The way that the arrangement works is we've really been working together to drive incentives together where both parties are really driven to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the operation. And so I wouldn't say that it's economics built into specifics in the agreement as much as it is that we're well aligned together to really drive these types of improvements. And that's what we're seeing. Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. That's fair. Pat, apologize again if I missed this. But any update on Medicare reimbursement? Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: I'd be disappointed if somebody didn't ask me that. Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: Not any new updates other than we continued to work very closely with CMS. Washington has been busy as you might expect, but we are working very closely with them on the two initiatives we talked about. And I hope to get it before my 61st birthday, which is coming up pretty soon. Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Fair enough. And then maybe just to spread the questions here. Dan, you mentioned new partnerships. I think you may have just been referring to going after new partnerships. But just to be clear, did you sign any new ones during the quarter? Daniel J. Levangie - Insulet Corp.: Yeah, Jayson, what I said was I'm really pleased with the pipeline of projects that we have at hand. And didn't identify any new projects. We're not going to talk about individual projects because of the confidential nature of those agreements with our pharmaceutical partners. I'd just leave it at that. Really happy with the progress we've made in developing a pipeline of opportunities that I think will pay off handsomely down the road for the company. Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Good afternoon. Lots been asked, but I just \u2013 I'm curious about. You mentioned pediatrics as a defense against 670G and some of the limitations with that product. Is there anything you're willing to sort of share in terms of how many of your patients, your new starts at this point are pediatric? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: So, Raj, I wouldn't say defense. I just think it's a reason why it's a separate segment and a separate target and a separate value proposition. But I'm not sure how much we shared before, but pediatric patients are approximately 30% of our total patient population. Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC : And what about of the new patients that are coming in? Are pediatrics \u2013 I guess, I won't ask you for a full number, but is it a higher number than that 30% in the sense is your pediatric volume growing? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: I think it's in that neighborhood. I don't really know it off the top of my head and I don't want to give you a wrong answer but it's in that neighborhood. Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC : Okay. That's fair. And then just in terms of things you're doing on the sales force side in terms of continuing to grow that effort. Clearly the numbers are good. So I imagine you're adding salespeople, but anything you can provide with that? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. We're very pleased that sales force productivity is now at the pre-expansion level, just where we thought it would be from the previous sales force expansion. So we are evaluating and likely will expand the sales force as we look at the growth opportunities before us in 2017 and maybe even before then. Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thank you. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC: Good afternoon and maybe a question for Shacey first on the attrition. We've talked over time about trying to take some of the lessons learned in new patients and translate that to the installed base. Can you break down the sources of attrition for us as they're different somewhat in the installed base and then what initiatives you guys are looking at over what timeframe? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. So we do track this very closely, by the way. And we have made progress on new patient attrition. It's just that I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves and it is kind of a lagging indicator. But we do see encouraging signs that we are providing a better customer experience and that should lead, of course, to satisfaction and retention. There are two main drivers to patient attrition. The first is just the product quality and experience. So I think part of what's driving the improvements that we see in retention is just improving product quality in the field. And then the other main driver is market access reimbursement and coverage. So, for example, we have sadly Podders that age into Medicare and lose coverage for Omnipod. That's just one example. When we lose coverage that's obviously a driver and it's one of the reasons why we've invested in market access and why we continue to invest in clinical data on the outcomes and cost economics of Omnipod because that's what can help us secure and expand our market access position and address that side of retention. Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then my follow-up is on the international side. And obviously you've got the partnership with Ypsomed that runs for a couple more years. What other direct or perhaps distributor-based international opportunities are there aside from where you're already working with Ypsomed that you're particularly excited about that could be incremental as we move into 2017 and 2018? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: For example, we're not heavily penetrated into Central and Eastern Europe. So, most of our business today is in Western Europe, so there's opportunity there. But I would say that there's opportunity everywhere across Europe. I mean Ypsomed has done a nice job growing the business and they've been a great partner for us over the years. But still, as in the United States, there's relatively low penetration of pump utilization. So there's an opportunity to continue to grow that market and continue to penetrate into our existing markets as well as growing into some newer countries. Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC: Are there reimbursement challenges there or just you need to get feet on the street and kind of detail the product successfully? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: It just really depends on the market. Obviously it's fragmented in Europe, so it just depends on the particular country. There's a mix of both. And ultimately I think anywhere you sell Omnipod, you're going to need to build an expertise in market access, just like we're doing in the United States. Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Ryan Blicker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. This is Ryan Blicker on for Doug. Thanks for taking my questions. So, another really strong quarter across the entire diabetes business. I think even when assuming a pretty high reorder rate, it's pretty tough to get to these revenue numbers without assuming that you're tracking to higher than 20% installed base growth for the year. Any comment about that? Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: No. Ryan Blicker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Fair enough. Okay. Sorry, go ahead. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: Well Mike, I think it's fair to say that what we've said before is what we expect for the year, the 20% growth in new patient starts in the United States and 20% global growth. Yeah. Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: Consistent with our previous comments on the installed base growth is the 20% number is the one we're very comfortable with. Ryan Blicker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then, one of the pipeline; I apologize if I missed this. But did you begin on body trials of your artificial pancreas product late in the quarter or early this quarter? And is 2019 still the right way to think about the U.S. launch of that system? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yes, and yes. In fact, we started on body trials, I guess \u2013 when was the first \u2013 it was September. So that was the first IDE. And then we've just gotten second phase IDE approved by the FDA to look at that on body system and the algorithm performance in pediatrics and adolescents. And I think 2019 is the right way to look at the system entry. Ryan Blicker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Suraj Kalia with Northland Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Suraj A. Kalia - Northland Securities, Inc.: Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. So, first, Dan, let me just start out, congrats to you and the team. You guys have executed a phenomenal turnaround in the last seven quarters, eight quarters and kudos to the entire team. That having said, let me start out with the two questions for Shacey. Shacey, obviously a lot of questions have been asked on the 670G. And I thought I heard you say that you all are not being affected. It's a different target market, especially in pediatrics. At least I thought I heard that. I guess my question, Shacey, is why do you all feel you are not being affected? My understanding is the 670G is 14 years and older indication on label. Are you all seeing no impact? Is it simply because of Medtronic's current marketing efforts \u2013 they're trying to convert their existing users to the 670 or any \u2013 if you could help me reconcile why you all are not seeing the impact? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Right. Sure. So, right. One reason is the one that you alluded to, which is that the product is not appropriate or indicated for the pediatric segment. I think the other reason that you're alluding to is that the data for 670G included well controlled patients on existing pump therapy. So I don't know Medtronic's strategy but it would seem like a likely target that they will focus on tubed pump patients who are well controlled. And then the third reason is it's just not our segment. We are sales strategy, our commercial organization. Our messaging is focused on the multiple daily injection patients. That is not where 670G is focused. And so I guess that's part of what's protecting us. We do \u2013 I don't want to underestimate. There is a tremendous amount of noise in the market. And so we are spending time clarifying what this new technology is and what it is not. And I guess we're just resonating and getting through that noise. But that's going to be with us for a while and we're fully prepared to do that. We have a different market segment and what we think is a very unique value proposition with Omnipod. Suraj A. Kalia - Northland Securities, Inc.: And for my follow-up question, Shacey, I know you all \u2013 you mentioned something about the FDA just approved the second IDE. Shacey, can you give us some additional color on your artificial pancreas program? I guess what I'm really trying to understand is, is it Hybrid or is it true closed loop? Are you all looking at hyperglycemic events? Are you'll looking at \u2013 there's so many variables as we all know and I think 2018, 2019 keeps coming up. That's a pretty fast ramp-up from trial to launch and any color on \u2013 what is this product eventually going to be looking at? Thank you for taking my questions. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. You're welcome. So I would agree. Artificial pancreas means a lot of different things to a lot of different people. And in fact I'm getting a little unenamoured with the name itself. It's an artificial pancreas research program. Our first product is the Omnipod Horizon Automated Glucose Control System. This is a Hybrid Loop Control System. But I think what we've done is taken a step back and said, what do people living with type 1 diabetes really want in an Automated Glucose Control System. And so we're focused less on features and technology and more on the user experience and how do we provide better control and better user experience. So we are anticipating that our system will be fully closed loop system overnight with Hybrid Loop Control System during the day. Operator : Thank you. We have time for one more question. And our last question will come from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Good afternoon, guys, and congratulations on the quarter. Shacey, let me just follow-up on that question. The Hybrid Closed Loop during the day on the Horizon System, I think I might have asked you this question before, but I'm going to ask it again. Would that have an auto bolus component as well maybe a high, medium, low carb choice or something like that, but a meal time auto-bolus, something like that, in it as well? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: The patient will still be required to bolus. So we are looking at ways to reduce the burden of carb estimation as you just alluded to, but the patient will be required to bolus. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then, Dan, just one question for you and congratulations on the retirement. But question for you on the Drug Delivery pipeline. And that is timelines change in a lot of these things. I know you guys say you're making a lot of progress there. I guess what I'm wondering is, as those timelines change, I think the last update you gave or commentary you've made in the past is the next Drug Delivery product could be a few years out, three years to four years out. Could you update that timeline? When might we see another Drug Delivery product outside of the Onpro system contributing to your revenues? Daniel J. Levangie - Insulet Corp.: Yes. I'd say we're kind of in the same zone here of four years to five years, would be my best estimate. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Kind of four years to five years from where we are today, is that how you \u2013 just to clarify? Daniel J. Levangie - Insulet Corp.: Yes. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Operator : I'm showing no further questions at this time. And I'd like to turn the conference back over to Pat Sullivan for his closing remarks. Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: Thank you, operator. Let me summarize by saying again how pleased I am with the progress and the performance of the company not just during the last two quarters of remarkable growth, but our employees' commitment and focus during a time of significant transition over the last couple of years. We still have tremendous opportunities for growth in front of us. And I am impressed every day by the team's passion and execution. Our line of sight to sustainable and profitable growth comes more into focus each and every day. We will continue to build on our foundation and execute on our strategy and we are more confident than ever we will deliver long-term sustainable and profitable growth for our investors. Our Q3 results simply speak for themselves. I'd like to close by thanking the Insulet employees for all your hard work and dedication in doing what you do every day to simplify life for people with diabetes. Terrific job, well done, and keep up the great work. We look forward sharing much more with you in a couple of weeks at our Investor Day in Boston on November the 16. Thank you for your participation today. And, Dan, good luck. Daniel J. Levangie - Insulet Corp.: Thanks, Pat. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Deborah Gordon : Thank you, Sandra. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2016 earnings call. Joining me today are Patrick Sullivan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Shacey Petrovic, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Michael Levitz, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The replay of this call will be archived on our website. Our press release discussing our fourth quarter 2016 results and first quarter and full year 2017 guidance is also available in the IR section of our website. Before we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to be materially different from any future results implied by such statements. Such factors include those referenced in our Safe Harbor statement in our fourth quarter earnings release and in the company's filings with the SEC. With that, I'll turn the call over to Pat. Patrick Sullivan : Thank you, Deb. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on the call today. I'll begin this afternoon's call with a brief review of our Q4 and 2016 full year performance and share with you recent business highlights and our accomplishments. Mike will then discuss our 2016 financial results and introduce our 2017 guidance. Shacey will then provide an update on our exciting commercial and R&D progress. And then we'll open the call for questions. I am absolutely thrilled with Insulet's recent performance. 2016 was simply an amazing and very successful year. Our 2016 revenue was $367 million, up $103 million than prior year, representing growth of 39% and $3 million over the midpoint of our guidance range. Our gross margin for the year improved to 57.5% for the full year, up 700 basis points from 50.5% just a year ago. Every area of our business delivered outstanding performance in 2016. U.S. OmniPod revenue was $230 million, an impressive growth of 21% over prior year, our international OmniPod revenue was $72 million, a terrific growth rate of 78% and this growth was driven by deeper expansion in our existing markets and significant growth in new markets. We finished 2016 with an OmniPod worldwide installed base of between 105,000 and 110,000 active users, an increase of more than 25% over 2015. And our Drug Delivery revenue was $65 million, a remarkable 92% growth. This performance was primarily due to sales to Amgen of its Neulasta Onpro kit. And according to Amgen's most recent public comments, the Onpro kit represented approximately 50% of total U.S. Neulasta doses at the end of 2016, just two short years after product launch. I'm extremely pleased with our team's execution and the progress across all areas of business. And I'm even more excited about our great prospects and opportunities for 2017. Now, let me provided you for a few highlights from last year. We started off the year by divesting Neighborhood Diabetes, a business that did not fit our higher growth OmniPod and Drug Delivery products. In 2016, we brought Chuck Alpuche into the company to lead our Worldwide Operations. Chuck quickly built a team and made significant improvements to our manufacturing operations and supply chain during 2016, resulting in significantly improved gross margins. The improvement was due in part to increased daily output with fewer headcount as well as reduction in manufacturing scrap. In 2016, we manufactured approximately 65% more pods than we did in 2015 with 20% fewer headcount and a 50% reduction in scrap. As a result of these efficiency initiatives, we achieved approximately 15% savings for the pod, which not only drives down cost, but most importantly significantly improves the quality of the product and the customer's experience. We also made significant investments and improvements in our manufacturing supply chain to provide for redundancy and improved cost. In addition by the end of 2016, we implemented product shipments from China to the United States via ocean freight. As you know we recently announced the purchase of new manufacturing facility in Acton, Massachusetts, just 15 miles from headquarters where we will install highly automated manufacturing lines and expect to be operational in 2019. One U.S. line as compared to all four of our lines in China will be capable of producing up to 70% of our total capacity in China with up to 90% few headcount. Meanwhile, we will continue to improve our performance in China where we will continue to manufacture products. We are very excited about this new phase for our manufacturing and operation strategy, which will support our growth plans and further reduce per unit cost and improve quality. In March, we brought in Aiman Malek on Board as our SVP of Advanced Technology and Engineering. We're making great progress on our innovation roadmap and are very excited about introducing our OmniPod Dash product at the ADA Tradeshow in June. The impressive capability of our San Diego innovation team will differentiate us in mobile technology, human factors, and data analytics. We've also been making significant progress on our artificial pancreas program with very good results. Both of these development efforts were on-schedule will allow Insulet to maintain our competitive edge with truly innovative and differentiated products. During 2016, there were a number of changes in the diabetes marketplace that cause significant disruptions to competitors in the tubed pump market. Although we're not immune to these dynamics, our significant product differentiation as well as the strength of our business model, insulate us much from much of these distractions. And any time there are disruptions in markets as we're seeing today in the diabetes market, there are opportunities to benefit significantly from these market dynamics. We intend to invest to make sure we get our share of this opportunity; we've got a strong balance sheet of true differentiated technology and a very dedicated team on the frontlines to make sure that we win. Our Drug Delivery team did a phenomenal job in executing on a significant opportunity with Amgen. In addition, we're working closely with a number pharmaceutical partners to determine the feasibility of using the OmniPod technology to the delivery of other compounds. We're very excited and bullish in the long-term potential of our Drug Delivery business. In September, we raised $345 million in the convertible debt financing at some very attractive terms. This additional capital allowed us to retire a portion of the pre-existing debt and provides the capital to support our significant growth and fund our U.S. manufacturing strategy. Throughout 2016, we executed and drove results within every aspect of the business. I'm very proud of our team and the dedicated efforts and accomplishments. Together we have developed a strong and robust strategy with a truly differentiated product platform that positions Insulet for significant growth. As a result of this hard work and dedication, we have everything we need today to deliver significant organic growth and capture the substantial marker opportunity before us. We are well on our way of achieving $1 billion in revenue over the next five years and I'm very excited and confident in our ability to deliver on that promise. With that let me turn the call over to Mike. Michael Levitz : Thank you, Pat. I will review our fourth quarter 2016 results and then introduce our first quarter and full year 2017 guidance. As I review our results, unless otherwise stated, all commentary regarding changes will be on a year-over-year basis. We are very pleased to report fourth quarter revenue growth of 24% with revenue of $103.6 million compared to $83.8 million. All three of our product lines contributed meaningfully to this growth. We exceeded the midpoint of our stated guidance by $3 million with strong performance from all of our product lines with over half of the beat coming from the United States OmniPod due to strong demand from our growing installed base. Our fourth quarter gross margin increased to 58.8%, up 870 basis points from 50.1%, primarily from improving manufacturing and supply chain efficiency and effectiveness as well as improvements in product quality. Operating expenses increased to $65.1 million compared to $54.6 million. This increase included a charge of approximately $6 million through write-down in-process software due to a change in our ERP system requirement. The increase was reflects the cost of additional headcount to support the expansion of our business including increased investment in our innovation projects as well as continued expansion of our commercial and operational infrastructure. We ended 2016 with almost $300 million in cash and investment compared to $123 million at the end of 2015. This increase was primarily driven by $180 million from our issuance of 1.25% coupon convertible notes in the third quarter, net of issuance costs and the repurchase of two-thirds of our existing 2% convertible notes. We also will generate over $15 million dollars in cash from operations in 2016 compared to cash outflows from operations of over $12 million. As a result of our significantly improved operating performance even as we increased investments in inventory and operational initiatives to support the continued growth in our business. We're making great early progress in establishing our U.S. manufacturing operation announced a few months ago. And we remain on-schedule for production out of our new Massachusetts facility beginning in 2019. We expect capital expenditures to increase above historic levels to fund the new U.S. manufacturing operation and these are funded by the net proceeds from our convertible notes offering in 2016. We are very pleased with our financial position coming out of the fourth quarter as we continue to make these strategic investments in support of our near and longer term organic growth opportunities. I will now walk you through our 2017 outlook. We finished 2016 strong and have great momentum and our guidance reflects our expectation of continued strong growth in 2017. For the full year, we expect revenue in the range of $420 million to $440 million compared to revenue of $367 million, representing growth of 17% at the midpoint. We expect strong revenue growth across all of our business lines. First, we expect U.S. OmniPod in the range of $257 million to $265 million, representing growth of 14% at the midpoint. This growth reflects our growing U.S. installed base, partially offset by two points due to contractual expiration earlier this year of a royalty, which contributed $5 million in 2016. Second, we expect international OmniPod in the range of $94 million to $101 million, representing growth of 36% at the midpoint on strong growth in our installed base in both historic and newer international markets. And third, we expect Drug Delivery of $69 million to $74 million, representing growth of 10% at the midpoint on continued strong market adoption of the Neulasta Onpro kit. For the first quarter of 2017, we expect revenue in the range of $96 million to $99 million compared to $81.2 million, representing growth of 20% at the midpoint. We expect this to be driven by continued strong growth across our business lines. First, we expect U.S. OmniPod in the range of $56.5 million to $57.5 million, representing growth of 12% at the midpoint. Second, we expect the international OmniPod in the range of $23 million to $24 million, representing growth of 53% at the midpoint. And third, we expect Drug Delivery in the range of $16.5 million to $17.5 million, representing growth of 13% at the midpoint. On gross margins, we expect our full year gross margin continue to increase significantly, approaching almost 60% for 2017 compared to 57.5%, reflecting the operational improvements made in 2016 and continued improvements in 2017, including the partial year impact of our move from air to ocean freight we have discussed previously. We are extremely pleased with the tremendous progress to-date in margin expansion and the expected 2017 result nearing 60%, which as a reminder had been our five-year target just a few quarters ago before we increased our multiple year target to 65% on our stronger performance and outlook. To achieve our goals, we will continue to invest in our business to drive long-term growth and profitability including commercial, research, and development, and infrastructure investments. While our level of spend for the upcoming year may change, we currently expect an approximate 20% to 25% increase in 2017 operating expenses over 2016, driven largely by increased vendor support our product development and innovation pipeline, expansion of our commercial team to meet our growing demand, and the investments in our manufacturing and supply chain operations. As such we expect EBIT in 2017 to be roughly in line with 2016 and are on-track with our goal of becoming sustainably EBIT positive beginning in 2018. We also remain confident about reaching $1 billion in revenue in five years with gross margin of 65% or higher, delivering above-market profitability. I will now turn the call over to Shacey. Shacey Petrovic : Thanks Mike. The team and I are excited about the great momentum we have coming out of 2016 and we are already off to the races in 2017. Insulet competes in a large, growing, and underpenetrated market and we've had success capitalizing on this market opportunity evidenced by the robust revenue growth we achieved this past year and we will again deliver strong revenue growth in 2017. We ended 2016 with an estimated worldwide installed base between the 105,000 and 110,000 active users, which represents a worldwide increase of more than 25% over 2015. Year-over-year we grew our U.S. installed base by approximately 15% and our international installed base by more than 50% with our mixed now about 60% to 65% in the U.S. and 35% to 40% international. As a reminder, our installed base is an estimate due to the fact that close to half of our U.S. sales and most of our international sales are through a third-party distribution channel. As I mentioned on our last call, we did encounter some noise in the U.S. market in Q4 around the approval of 670G. While this caused a slight distraction, it was not a disruption. This noise simply lengthens some patient decision-making processes, which resulted in slower conversion rate from an interested patient to product shipment. In 2016, our growth in new patient starts over the growth in new patient starts in 2015 was 13%. While we had a stated goal of 20% compounding growth, this represents more than 15,000 new patients in 2016 compared to approximately 13,000 new patients in 2015. Because of OmniPod's recurring revenue model and because in any given quarter, new patient starts equates to about 10% of U.S. revenue, this conversion delay did not meaningfully impact our U.S. revenue finish. Our approximate 15% U.S. installed base growth for 2016 or our strong outlet for 2017. In 2017, we will continue to drive great year-over-year growth and expect our U.S. installed base to again increase by approximately 15%. Coupled with exciting and fast-paced growth internationally, we once again expect our global installed base to grow approximately 20% year-over-year. Due to a recurring revenue model, the growth in installed base as opposed to compounding growth in new patient starts is much more indicative of revenue growth. Our 2017 U.S. OmniPod growth will be driven by continued commercial execution focused on three things. One, leveraging our expanded market access team and clinical data to improve customer access through private payers and Medicaid plan. Two, U.S. sales force expansion and a targeted patient awareness campaign. And three, continuing to raise the bar for customer care and a world-class customer experience. First, our expanded market access team is using the strong clinical data published last year to secure and expand coverage for OmniPod. As you'll recall in 2016, there were three publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals demonstrating the clinical and quality of life benefits associated with OmniPod. This growing body of evidence has proven to be impactful with payers and in 2016, our team added 15 million covered lives through Medicaid and Managed Medicaid plans across the U.S. These efforts will accelerate in 2017 with continued focus on Medicaid, regional private payers, and other avenues for securing access and reducing hurdles for new customers to get OmniPod. These initiatives both to continue to build a strong foundation of clinical data for OmniPod as well as to use the data to drive expanded coverage will continue in 2017. This year we plan to once again have a number of peer-reviewed publications evaluating OmniPod's critical role in reducing the burden of diabetes, including data on our OmniPod Horizon Automated Glucose Control System, OmniPod data from large robust registry studies, and OmniPod real-world use data. This real-world use data will complement our unique pay-as-you-go business model advantages to demonstrate OmniPod's value to payers. Second, at the beginning of this year, we expanded our U.S. sales team by 20%, strengthening our field particularly in areas where we have strong market access and in some previously uncovered geographies. We are arming this expanded team with the right messaging and tools to continue to drive new patient starts and growth in clinician utilization. The sales team is delivering a strong message highlighting OmniPod's positive impact on quality of life and reduction of the burden. The data published just a few months ago demonstrating OmniPod's remarkable ability to reduce diabetes distress and improve quality of life coupled with OmniPod's dramatic reduction in burden is resonating with our clinician. OmniPod offers the ability -- the potential to reduce the number of required steps for insulin delivery by almost 50% compared to tubed insulin pump and by a whopping 86% compared to multiple daily injection. OmniPod significantly reduces burden for people living with diabetes and this results in better compliance which drives improved quality of life and improved outcome. The sales team also remained focused on implementation of Insulet Provided Glooko in our targeted offices. We now have more than 30,000 Podders using Glooko, that's almost half of our U.S. installed base. And this tool continues to drive increased utilization among our clinician with Glooko offices averaging a fivefold increase in OmniPod prescription post-implementation. This valuable resource is helping our Podders and their care teams gain insights to improve their diabetes management and its demonstrating to clinicians the positive impact that OmniPod can have on their patients' compliant and glycemic control. In addition to an expanded field presence with stronger clinical messaging and great tools like Glooko, we're also expanding our patient awareness effort. We're pursuing a targeted digital direct-to-patient campaign to highlight OmniPod's quality of life improvement and ability to reduce diabetes burden. Over the past year we've seen a significant increase in unaided patient awareness following our rebranding. This increased awareness was also associated with increased activation of those patients to take some form of action, like speaking to their doctor or requesting an OmniPod demo kit. Our focus is on generating awareness and activating patients in select geographies where we have strong clinician support and solid coverage. These commercial investments in clinical data, sales force expansion, and awareness will drive demand and growth in 2017. Finally, in 2016, we significantly improved the OmniPod customer experience and this is an area where will continue to raise the bar in 2017. This past year we focused on measuring and improving our customer experience through reduced turnaround time from lead to shipment, customer satisfaction surveys, and improve new patient training. We delivered an impressive result with standardization of improved training tools, a meaningful reduction in turnaround time from qualified lead to shipment, and in Q4, 96% of our customers indicated that they were very satisfied with customers -- with OmniPod's customer care. In the coming year, we will continue to drive a world-class customer experience through the launch of an innovative online patient training portal, automated benefits investigation tools, and the launch of our financial assistance program. Lastly, expanding and strengthening our footprint in international markets will continue to be an important factor in our growth. Our focus is on both expansion and penetration in international markets. Today we are in less than 20 countries across the world and we're primarily focused in North America and Europe. While our near-term growth will come from the markets we are in today, over the medium to long-term, we see the geographic expansion and continued robust growth for OmniPod. In 2016, our international installed base grew by more than 50%, reflecting remarkable performance across our market. In addition to our strong commercial execution and international expansion, we've made significant headway in our innovation roadmap. We've had particularly great progress with OmniPod Dash, our Bluetooth connected platform to provide our customers with a modern intuitive touchscreen PDM and more data and functionality on their mobile phone. We are excited about this new system and how it will benefit Podders. Over the last few months, we completed the majority of our development work, had a very positive pre-submission meeting with the FDA and started our human factors work. We remain on-track to debut this platform at ADA in San Diego in June and to launch later on this year. Dash is the platform for our innovation roadmap including our OmniPod Horizon Automated Glucose Control System. OmniPod Horizon will incorporate CGM data from Dexcom's G5 G6 sensors to automate insulin delivery, reduce burden for our user, and deliver the first on-body hybrid closed loop system. We are currently in clinical trials for Horizon and we completed two IDE studies in 2016, including 34 adults and 24 children down to age six. We are incredibly excited by the early results of the trial, which demonstrated excellent glucose control and tremendous promise to make a significant impact in the market. And just a couple weeks ago, our first data was presented at the 10th International Conference on Advanced Technologies & Treatments for Diabetes. Dr. Bruce Buckingham, Professor of Pediatric Endocrinology at Stanford and principal investigator of this study shared impressive results, highlighting the system's improved glucose control, timing range, and reduction of hypoglycemia. OmniPod U200 and U500 concentrated insulins are also being developed on our Dash platform in partnership with Eli Lilly. These programs are on-track with U500 formative human factors work and clinical trial enrollment complete and U200 technical and clinical trial design work well underway. And lastly, we're making great progress within our Drug Delivery business. Similar to our diabetes franchise, the opportunity within Drug Delivery is enormous. We recently extended our agreement with Amgen, which reflects the strength of our partnership. The Neulasta on-body injector leverages the Pod's precise dosing capabilities to provide better delivery and better outcomes for physicians, payers, and patients. There are a number of other opportunities in our pipeline exploring OmniPod's impact on simplifying the user-experience. Our OmniPod platform has the ability to improve the experience for patients and drive better adherence and improved outcomes and we're working with our pharmaceutical partners to capture this broader market opportunity. In summary, we are on a very exciting trajectory and we're so proud of the team's hard work to get us where we are today. OmniPod, whether used by people living with diabetes or to deliver a novel medicine like Neulasta, allows our users to feel more confident to live more normal life and to experience improved quality of life and improved outcome. Our innovative product development pipeline will accelerate adoption over the near and long-term and will drive sustainable and profitable growth. And I look forward to sharing with you our progress during what will be an exciting 2017. So, with that I will turn the call back to Pat. Patrick Sullivan : Thanks Shacey. Operator, we'll now open the call up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. David Lewis : Good afternoon. Congrats, another good quarter. So, for the broader changes, starting off with guidance here for a second. It looks to us U.S. OmniPod is roughly in line with us ex the royalty. I just wonder Shacey what assumptions were made here in 2017 for potential competitive launches coming into the spring? And then ex-U.S. momentum was a lot better than we expected, is this the same countries we saw in 2016 or broader strength? And I have one quick follow-up after that. Shacey Petrovic : Okay. So, David, yes, we did take into consideration the competitive dynamics in the market in our guidance for 2017. It just offset by the commercial investments that we're making and what we see so far as strength in leads in the pipeline. So, we're feeling confident in the guidance that we just gave. In terms of international, really it is driven by a lot of the strength that we saw throughout 2016, particularly France as a new market. The uptake there has just been tremendous and probably blew everybody's expectations away really and that's driving significant growth in 2017. It continues to do that. But really there is strength across all of Europe and Canada and so that's just reflected in the guidance for 2017 as well. David Lewis : Okay. And then Pat I know your favorite question, but I wonder if you could share with us just updated timing on Medicare and if you can't, just was Medicare kind of forecasted in 2017 guidance and any insight you can provide on whether we should be expecting Part D coverage versus other forms of coverage? Thank you. I'll jump back in queue. Patrick Sullivan : No conference call would be completed without an update on Medicare coverage. So, during 2016, we made significant progress to secure Medicare reimbursement and our interactions with CMS had been primarily with CMS courier staff. I was very hopeful to get a decision in January between the change -- before the change of the administration, but as the expected, as soon as the new administration took over, all actions across the government and policy decisions within CMS were put on hold and CMS has communicated that they hope to resolve this issue as soon as the new appointees are put in their jobs. So, I think it's simply a change in the administration and there was no -- in fact, we -- there no expectation in our guidance for Medicare reimbursement in 2017, David. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Johnson of Robert Baird. Your line is now open. Jeff Johnson : Thank you. Good afternoon guys. So, Pat maybe I can follow-up just on that CMS point, maybe a little bit of a surprise earlier this year when they talked about putting pumps back into competitive bidding in 2019. Obviously that then got suspended as the new administration came in and wants to take a look at all those things. But just how is your outlook, I guess, for CMS coverage? Are you still as bullish that you will get it, will it mean as much as their risk if you do get it that as you get to 2019, would OmniPod be considered a competitive bid type product, or do you get protection in that if it does go to Part D as David asked or something like that? Patrick Sullivan : Yes, I think the news that came out of Medicare on the competitive bidding for Part D Medicare applies specifically the tube pumps technology, which are durable medical equipment. CMS has never considered as durable medical equipment thus far. And I would say that as we look at coverage options, they can do Medicare Part B or Medicare Part D, we actually think we fit better in the Medicare Part D. But I think that in terms of our position within CMS, I think we have a very strong position with coverage of OmniPod under either Medicare Part B or D and I have every conference we're going to get Medicare coverage just as usual can't say exactly when. As I often said, the only thing is certain is April 15th is tax deadline and we're working with the government. Shacey Petrovic : I would just add one more thing on that note, which is that PMA products are not eligible for competitive bidding. So, if you could just fast-forward to 2019, 2020, most pumps are going to be center augmented pumps, which are PMA products and so it -- I'm not sure that it's going to have a material influence if it comes through even on the growth rate behind that competitor -- behind the pump market. Jeff Johnson : Yes, understand. That's a great point Shacey. And then I guess my other -- my follow-up question would just be maybe a bigger picture question. So, we've seen JDRF, we've seen NIH come out, some big grants, a lot of funding of some pump studies and really I guess the closed loop and hybrid loop systems in that. Where does Insulet stand in may be deferring some of their own spending or your own spending on some of these studies grants and other things, are there opportunities out there? We've seen a lot of this money flowing to some of the other private payers here -- or private players here recently? Shacey Petrovic : Yes, I think there's opportunity. There's certainly a lot of energy and advocacy behind seeing progress on the artificial pancreas front. That said, in many cases, the funding comes with other strings attached to it. And so it's just a business decision in terms of whether or not we want to take advantage of that type of funding or not. Either way we're committed to making progress in our program. We're making really exciting progress on the Horizon product and I don't think for that particular product that we're going to need or tap into private funding. But who knows, it's a long-term program. We see iterations on that product in the future after we launch Horizon. Jeff Johnson : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Mike Weinstein : Thank you and thanks for all the updates on the business, because it's obviously helpful for us for trying to track progress. Let me just try and clarify couple of items. Probably the first thing would be maybe Shacey you could do this, but could us reconcile the 15% growth in the U.S. installed base in 2016 versus the 21% revenue growth. How do we get from one to the other? Shacey Petrovic : In U.S., we'll probably -- let's see the 15% installed base is what we saw in the U.S. in terms of revenue growth that's driven by primarily the growth in the installed base. Mike Weinstein : Yes, what's the six-point difference there? Michael Levitz : This is Mike. So, principally it\u2019s the installed base that's the biggest driver of it. There are other factors that can be involved in terms of mix and pricing and there also in 2015 versus 2016, in the early part of 2016, there was destocking and so that played into it as well. That was -- it's pretty much in line. The main driver going forward is really given the recurring revenue business is really the installed base and that's what we've been talking more about that. Shacey Petrovic : Yes. And we see that in Q4. Q4 was I think 17% growth year-over-year and that's pretty much what we're forecasting besides the royalty in 2017. Mike Weinstein : In the 17% Q4 growth in U.S. installed, is that what you're saying Shacey? Shacey Petrovic : I was saying revenue actually. Mike Weinstein : Averaging revenues, okay. Let me ask you -- just on the fourth quarter -- Shacey on the 3Q call, you said that we're on-track to grow our 2016 worldwide installed base by 20% and generate approximately 20% growth in our U.S. new patient starts consistent with our prior guidance. But then on the update today, you announced in the call that U.S. new patient starts for the year increased just 13%. So, I guess my question is what happened in the fourth quarter that made the 20% go to 13% for the year? Shacey Petrovic : Yes, I mean our leads were incredibly robust. In fact they were at record rates. They still are at record rates in Q1. And so what we didn't really appreciate in November on that call was the delay in the conversion rate from lead to new patient shipment. And so that is -- that's basically what drove that. But one of the reasons it wasn't readily apparent is that it doesn't impact revenue performance in any meaningful way and so at the end of the day, we're really excited about the robust interest in pipeline and that's reflected in our guidance. And what we're trying to get you guys focused on is just the growth in installed base of as opposed that compounding growth rate in new patient starts, because it's much more indicative of revenue growth. Patrick Sullivan : And Mike this is Pat, I'd like to just amplify the response a little bit more. What the 13% versus 20% in new patient represents? Its approximately 800 customers difference year-over-year. That is about a little over $2 million in revenue in 2017 or its less than 1% of our revenue at the midpoint. So, that 7% delta only represents 1% of our total revenue for 2017. And I think it really points out the really strength of our business model. Unlike tubed pumps, we have a very predicable revenue model. We just think of our installed base coming into -- or at the end of 2016 and look out to 2017. 85% of our revenue -- our OmniPod revenue in 2017 was basically being provided for by the installed base at the end of 2016, apply that net of attrition and the royalty. If we only get the same number of new patients starts as we had in 2016, that's another 12.5%, or almost 13% and the new patient growth year-over-year represents only about 2% to 2.5%. So, Shacey mentioned, we have a very predictable revenue model given the strength of the installed base and a new patient year-over-year growth is really a very, very small percentage of the overall revenue for the company. As we said before, 90% -- 10% of our revenue usually in any given quarter comes from new patient starts. Some of that is -- we're getting the same number as last year and then the growth on top of that is only about 2%. So, we're very bullish about all the things we're doing this year to grow the new patient starts and continue to grow the business. But the 13% versus 20% is really a red herring. Mike Weinstein : Got it. And I agree on all that math, Pat. Is that why the first quarter U.S. revenue guidance is below the guidance for the year because of what you guys saw in the fourth quarter, so guided 12% U.S. revenue growth for 1Q versus the 14% for the year? And then I guess the last part of that would be what drives the acceleration over the course of the year? Thanks. Shacey Petrovic : Yes, so just seasonally, Q1 is always our lowest volume and lowest growth rate quarter for just a number of dynamics around the industry in the U.S. The other thing that's working against us is the royalty rate, so that starts in Q1 and so you see both of those of things in Q1. But in terms of acceleration, I think it's just our typical seasonality in the business, there's nothing other than that. Michael Levitz : Yes, and this is Mike. I would just say, we do expect the growth to accelerate through this year and we're excited we just added 20% growth in sales force and a number of initiatives. And so we're seeing growing demand and we expect the growth to continue to extend or expand through the year. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tao Levy of Wedbush. Your line is now open. Tao Levy : Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. Just first a clarification on the 15,000 new patients that you've mentioned Shacey in 2016 in the U.S. Is that net new patients or is that before sort of attrition if I'm thinking about 2015 ending installed base versus 2016 ending installed base? Shacey Petrovic : It's not net, so that's pre-attrition. And Tao -- I guess for everybody, the reason we're giving you that clarity is just to try to help you all understand. We know what's the beginning of the year, you're probably looking to reset your models and we just really want you to understand the drivers behind the revenue for the U.S. OmniPod business in particular, which is the installed base. And so we're going to be focusing more and more on just the growth in the installed base, which obviously factors in new patient growth as well as attrition rate. Tao Levy : Great. That's very helpful. And in spite of my follow-up question on the Drug Delivery, what's the reason that that would decline sequentially? My understanding was Amgen would place forward orders and they are pretty consistent throughout the years. So, surprised to see that go down or guide down sequentially in Q1? Thanks. Shacey Petrovic : Just timing on their forecast, really the -- our guidance is based on Amgen's forecast and I think that's just the timing of orders issue. Michael Levitz : And Tao this is Mike, I mean just to be clear so, there was -- to back up Shacey's point, it was roughly a run rate of about $15 million for the first three quarters of Q3. They had an order there and the business grew in the fourth quarter and we're going to see growth in that business -- nice growth in that business this year as well. So, the run rate in Q1 is higher than the first three quarters last year. Patrick Sullivan : Yes, particular when you consider the national advertising campaign that's on every television show that I've seen. The Onpro kit is all over the direct-to-consumer advertising campaign. Shacey Petrovic : That's true. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brooks West with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Brooks West : Hi, can you hear me? Patrick Sullivan : We got you. Brooks West : Great. Thanks guys. And congratulations on a good quarter. Shacey I want to dig into the Dash launch a little bit more, debut at ADA and launch sometime in the second half. But can you talk about how you're going to roll that product out? Does it become available right away to your installed -- your whole installed base? Give us a sense of that's going to work. And then when should we start to think about this product actually starting to drive the revenue line for you guys? Thanks. Shacey Petrovic : Sure. Yes, so in terms of the rollout for Dash, we will as any good company would do, we'll do a limited market release. So that will probably take us through the first quarter I would guess of 2018. And then we'll role it out both to our installed base and to new users and we're still finalizing some of the details around that commercial strategy. So, what I will say because I think sometimes we all get wrapped up in know how these lunches work for other players in the market. Again, because of our business model, it's not hugely problematic. So, if, for example, customers held off on -- first of all, we just right new patient starts, don't really drive meaningfully any revenue in a given quarter. So, if they hold off, it's not too impactful. And in our base, we're not counting on our base to cannibalize itself and opt-in for this new technology because our revenue is coming from Pod. So, we've got a lot of flexibility in terms of how we can launch this product and it's not going to mean that customers hold off for a quarter and its potentially challenging for our revenue. But we do believe it's going to be very differentiated. It will be the best user experience and interaction on the market today. So, we think it will be very attractive, particularly for our targeted segment, which are those multiple daily injection users. So, we are forecasting for that to drive value for us in 2018. Patrick Sullivan : Just one other amplification to that. One of the beauties of this new product and the new product launch is that the Pod will essentially be in the same configuration and most, if not, all of the components would be the same with the exception, primarily the Bluetooth chip that will be in the new generation Dash Pod. So, the manufacturing lines in China will -- we will convert those over and they will be -- they will have the ability to produce either of the new Dash Pod or the previous configuration Pods. And we'll be able to throttle this launch from a production standpoint very, very and we'll take the product launch in a very measured way to make sure that we do everything right this time. Brooks West : Got it, got it. Thank you for that. And then I guess just follow-up from me on Drug Delivery. You said expanded relationship with Amgen, is that beyond Neulasta or is that primarily Neulasta focused? Thanks. Shacey Petrovic : It's an extension of the Neulasta agreement. So,-- Patrick Sullivan : Testing beyond Neulasta. Shacey Petrovic : Right. Brooks West : Okay, perfect. Thanks guys. Shacey Petrovic : Thanks Brooks. Operator : And our next question comes from Doug Schenkel of Cowen & Co. Your line is now open. Doug Schenkel : Hi, good afternoon and thank you for taking the questions. My first is on gross margin, you guided gross margin to approach 60%, this represent about 200 basis point improvement year-over-year. In terms of headwinds, is it right that your guidance embeds an assumption for a 100 to 150 basis point hit associated royalty expirees? And what the negative impact on gross margin associated with international OmniPod sales accounting for a higher mix of revenue? And I'll follow-up in a second with my second question. Michael Levitz : This is Mike. So, you're right. So, there is a headwind from the royalty moving away. But that really doesn't have that meaningful of an impact directionally. As I said moving to 60% as our one year view after that with our five-year target, we're really excited about. And that is as your point reflective of the fact that we do have unfavorable mix. We don't calculate or measure gross margin for the international business versus the direct business, but directionally, it definitely carries lower gross margins. It\u2019s a different business model for us and that a lot of it is through distributor. And so you get a lower gross margin but you don't the carry same operating expenses that you would in a direct business. And so the guidance that we are providing does factor in an unfavorable mix because the international business is growing so significantly. But some of that is coming from our direct business internationally as well which is growing very nicely, although that is a small part of the business. But what's really the driving the gross margin expansion is what we've been talking about at the Investor Day back in November and it's just the tremendous operational performance and that's going to only be augmented when we move to the U.S. manufacturing here in the next couple of years. Doug Schenkel : Okay. Thanks for the Mike. And quick follow-up. You guys in your prepared remarks described, I think you said 670G was a distraction on a disruption in the fourth quarter, would you willing to comment on how the distraction of all over the first two months of 2017? And relatedly -- and I apologize if I missed it, but is the chatter in the market on 670G at all factoring into the calculus behind your U.S. guidance? Thank you. Shacey Petrovic : Yes. So, as I said the competitive dynamics are factored into our U.S. guidance. So, that is true. And in 4, we added thousands of patients, so it was a successful quarter for us; just simply people were delaying their decision-making process. And that was reflected in the conversion rate. So, that's sort of how it's impacting us. These aren\u2019t lost leads. We categorize all of our patients in the consideration process and so we do know that they remain in the pipeline. The pipeline is stronger than it ever has been before. And so we're optimistic and it's taking some time for our people to do their research and kind of make their final decisions. And in so far in this -- so far in this year, we're seeing similar results, really slightly delayed conversion rate, but very strong record breaking leads in the pipeline, both coming in and as that pipeline grows and so we're feeling very good about where we are so far this year and that's reflected I think in the guidance. Michael Levitz : And this is Mike, just to add on the guidance piece. So, so as I mentioned in the fourth quarter, we had a significant beat. That was principally in the United States and our guidance and our expectations reflected an expectation that would be some disruption or some impact of the 670G and we were really pleased to see that impact was -- really didn\u2019t impact us in any meaningful revenues in the fourth quarter. And I would say that the same thought process is involved in our thinking for 2017 and that we really want to be thoughtful about the guidance and we believe the midpoint is realistic, but the high end of the guidance is certainly attainable and we'll see when launches and other market dynamics out there how our guidance evolves through the year, but we're very excited about the opportunities that we have, that's why we're adding the significant amount of salespeople to manage the growth in demand. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jayson Bedford of Raymond James. Your line is now open. Jayson Bedford : Good afternoon and congrats on the progress. Patrick Sullivan : Thanks Jayson. Jayson Bedford : Just a few questions. Can you give us an idea of how many new countries that you or Ypsomed expect to enter in 2017? Patrick Sullivan : What we're planning for 2017 is deeper penetration, primarily for the markets that we're in, so we won't be expanding into other markets with Ypsomed. And that's primarily because we're in discussions with them about the contract extensions, so we want to get those resolved before we continue to enter into new markets with Ypsomed. Jayson Bedford : Okay. So, this midpoint -- the 36% growth that doesn\u2019t reflect any new countries? Shacey Petrovic : That's right. No, that's existing growth, primarily from some of the -- the really high growth rates are from some of the early markets like France and Italy that we've entered into in last two years. Jayson Bedford : Okay. Is there any way you can quantify the contribution from the launch in France in the fourth quarter? Michael Levitz : This is Mike. No, and I would say the reason why is because when we take orders from Ypsomed, they are not telling us orders, it's not -- they give an order for how much product they want. We may ultimately find out what countries they go into, but we're selling to Ypsomed and they are managing the channel to various countries. So, you really can't say for certain when you're shipping something what countries going to go to. That said I think it's fair to say the growth that we've seen and why you see an outside growth when you look year-over-year for Q1 is that the launch of the new markets such as France in the second half of last year really drove a tremendous amount of growth and surfside Ypsomed and therefore surprised us positively. And we -- our guidance expects that that's going to continue, but at some point, that's going to level off, but we just don't know when that is and we're thrilled with the progress to-date. Jayson Bedford : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks guys. Let's keep it at that. Shacey Petrovic : Thanks Jayson. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Christian on for Raj. Good afternoon guys and congrats on a nice quarter. Just had a one question on the Horizon, is there any update here on the timeline, I'm sure we'll hear more at ADA, but are you still planning on pivotal trials by 2018 and then the commercial launch in 2019? And do you know yet what that launch is going to look like? How expensive it will be in 2019? Or whether it will really start to see the impact more in the 2020 timeframe if you have that detail yet? Patrick Sullivan : Yes, I think if you go back to our targeted timeline that we provided on Investor Day, there's a slide in that deck that outlines the Horizon artificial pancreas timeline. We've remained on-track with that timeline and I would say it's too early to talk about the launch until we get further through the process with the pre-pivotals and the pivotal trials for the FDA submission. Shacey Petrovic : But I'll add that you will see more OmniPod Horizon data at ADA. We're excited to have podium and poster presentations there and Horizon will be highlighted. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thanks. And then maybe one follow-up on Drug Delivery. As OmniPod -- I mean the Pods are now more than 50% of Neulasta script, where can that penetration go to, is it something you can run all the way up to almost all scripts, just kind to gauge how to model out into the out-years in terms of it plateauing at some point before you're able to execute another pharmaceutical arrangement? Patrick Sullivan : Well, the opportunity set as I've mentioned before on Neulasta is about 1.2 million doses potential in the United States. And there is some international market opportunity. But all of that conversion is in the hands of Amgen. They -- we provide product through them and they go through the conversion process with their clinician, their hospitals. So, from my perspective, every dose should be in an Onpro kit because the benefit it provides to their physicians, the payers, and patients, but ultimately that's in Amgen's hand. And I would say that their -- from our perspective, we know that they are very pleased and happy with their performance and the penetration they have had -- I think probably think of the opportunities like we do. Unidentified Analyst : And so what percent penetration does the guidance for 2017 imply that you get to by the end of year? Patrick Sullivan : There's no implication of a market penetration rate in the guidance that we provided. We provide product to Amgen and they provide it to the physicians and they give us purchase orders. There's not an implication -- it's not our position to give you an implied penetration. That's for Amgen to provide the market. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy with Leerink Partners. Your line is now open. Danielle Antalffy : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question and congrats on a strong end to the year. I was hoping to talk a little bit more about some of the competitive dynamics. So, you have J&J looking at strategic alternatives for their diabetes. There's rumors about Roche. Just wondering what kind of impact you're seeing commercially with the uncertainty that that could cause in the market if any? Medium to longer term what that could mean if those businesses do get divested? Patrick Sullivan : Well, Danielle I believe that anytime you have disruptions and the market is going through some changes, there's opportunities for other people to benefit. And we're making investments to make sure that we benefit from any disruptions that are occurring in the tubed pump market. We have a unique product platform with a lots of freedom provided to patients and it would be our intent to make sure that we get our fair share of any disruptions the marketplace that may occur. Shacey Petrovic : And we have had patients reach out to us looking for support or the opportunity to transition to OmniPod. And so we're fully prepared and we've got programs to help patients do that. We want people to have [Indiscernible] care obviously. But as I like to remind the sales team, so I'll take this opportunity to do it. Our number one competitor is multiple injections and so that's where 70% to 80% if not more of our patients come from in any given time period. And that's where we're focused. That's where OmniPod can provide 86% reduction in burden and that's our primary competitor right now. Danielle Antalffy : Sure. But I have to imagine with uncertainty around J&J and Roche that new patient might be more likely to go to an OmniPod versus -- yes okay. Shacey Petrovic : Actually Roche is not accepting new patients in the U.S. anymore, so really it's just about Medtronic and uniramous. Danielle Antalffy : Got it. Okay. And then I was wondering if you could provide some more details on where you're seeing some momentum in the U.S. I don't know if you guys have ever given this metric, but sort of are you seeing new prescribers come online? And if so, what's driving that versus I guess call them same order sales, existing prescribers just getting more and more patients on. Have you guys ever -- if any color you can give there, I think that should be helpful. Shacey Petrovic : Yes, we actually track that very carefully and while we've seen expansion in both, the primary driver of the growth is more penetration in existing accounts as opposed to expansion broadly of prescribers. But both are happening. It's just that the penetration or the same-store sales is definitely driving more than -- and we think Glooko is a big contributor to that as clinicians understand and can identify more patients in their practice that can benefit from OmniPod. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Suraj Kalia with Northland Securities. Your line is now open. Suraj Kalia : Good afternoon everyone. Congrats on the quarter. Patrick Sullivan : Thank you. Suraj Kalia : So, Shacey or Patrick, couple of questions. First, Shacey in your prepared remarks and forgive me if I got this wrong, I heard you talk about the Phase 2 IDE on patients six years or older. I guess what I was trying to understand is if you look at the 670G that is only 14 years or older, if you guys are going six years, are there any read-throughs on the sensitivity and specificity of your MPC algorithm? Just trying to understand from a competitive perspective, did I hear you correctly on the six year? Shacey Petrovic : You did. Yes. We are down to age six now, so the second IDE study that we completed was adolescent down to age six. And it's been very important to us from the beginning to be able to serve all of our customer population with Horizon and obviously, pediatric remains one of our fastest-growing elements of our patient population. And so we're intent, we're actually committed to ensuring that we will be able to serve all kids. In fact, our discussions with the FDA, they want us to come out with an indication down to two. So, and we have users down to two, so we certainly want to be able to do that as well. I don't know how to -- there can't be direct comparison today between Horizon and 670 or the algorithm. Although at ADA last year, on Frank Doyle did present data that demonstrated that MPC was performed better than a PID algorithm. So, that could be part of why we feel comfortable. But I'm going to say that the data looked great. We are very excited and totally committed to being to launch with a pediatric indication. Suraj Kalia : Fair enough. And Patrick were Shacey again, one last question from my side. I know the number of new patients for FY 2016, if I use 15,000 number, we've all been focused on that. But roughly speaking I guess, let me ask the question from a different flavor. Let's say if I assume 9% to 10% attrition rates, net new patients give or take is around 13,500 in the US, what do you think of the total net new patients in the U.S. across the Board? What does that represent? I guess I'm just trying to understand where do you all stack up in that market share, if I look at the 13,500 is that 10% share, is that 15%, how does that stack up? Thank you for taking my questions. Shacey Petrovic : In terms of market share which as I think Suraj what you were asking is that best data that we can refer to is at close concerned market research and that would demonstrate that we have somewhere in the neighborhood of 15% to 17% share of the pump market and a higher percent of new patient selecting a pump. But again we don't -- we really -- I know it might be hard to believe, but we don't pay a lot of attention to that data because our focus is on MDI patients and growing the market as opposed to taking share from tubed pump. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Ben Andrew of William Blair. Your line is now open. Patrick Sullivan : Hey Ben. Ben Andrew : Good afternoon. Couple of question for you. Just maybe talk about the timing to having an opportunity with Amgen for Onrpo outside the U.S. How do you think about potentially using other glucose sensitive Libre rather than G56 with the Horizon as you've mentioned that in the past? And then just a quick follow-up on reimbursement. Patrick Sullivan : Well, first of all, with Amgen growing international opportunity, we know they are exploring in international opportunity. That again is within their control and we don't -- they need to do all of the regulatory work to make sure that they provide the products in international markets. But that is something that I know they are working and it wouldn\u2019t necessarily involve us other than support for any regulatory clearance that they might need. Shacey Petrovic : They -- and Amgen I know made it public that they are in I think Costa Rica and potentially one other international market. And we understand that there's about 400,000 doses internationally. So, it does definitely represent a strong growth opportunity for us. But again that's for Amgen to execute on and we're supporting them in their international expansion plan. And the other question was about Libre, I think we've got a great partnership with Abbott. We like the Libre product. We know there are lot of customers -- a lot of overlap in the customers in Europe. People who are using both OmniPod and Libre and really getting dramatically reduced burden and a great customer experience. And so I think that's a nice opportunity. We have ongoing discussions about our pipelines and opportunities for continued partnership and development. But I don't have anything specific to comment on in terms of integration of Libre. Ben Andrew : Okay. Thanks. And then finally, just you mentioned the opportunity to keep expanding coverage, can you size for us as roughly the percentage of either private payers or Medicaid -- total patient population that you don't have access to today, so that's the opportunity? And then CMS still roughly to 20% in your mind or is it smaller than that? Thank you. Shacey Petrovic : If we look at just market access opportunity, it's probably an additional 40% or so of patients that we don't have access to because of Medicaid, Medicare and small regional payers. And so that's where we're focused. And I think what we've said in the past, I don't know about Medicare specifically by itself, but Medicare and Medicaid together represent about 30% of that opportunities. So, another 10% tied to regional payers. And we're making good progress on Medicaid. And as Pat said we remain confident that Medicare will happen, is just a matter of when. Operator : Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Pat Sullivan. Patrick Sullivan : Thank you, operator. I'll finish where I started. I am absolutely thrilled with Insulet's performance in 2016. Our team has done a remarkable job in driving our performance and positioning us for a continued success. We have the right tools to win and achieve our goal of a $1 billion in revenue in 2021. We have strong momentum across all areas of our business and we fully expect this momentum to continue. Our line of sight is sustainable topline growth and above market profitability becomes clear every day. And we are even more confident than ever in our ability to drive and deliver long-term shareholder value. I'd like to close by thanking the Insulet employees for your hard work and dedication to ease the burden and improve the lives of people who are living with diabetes and other disease. I'd also like to thank everyone for joining us on the call today and we very much look forward to sharing our significant progress with you during 2017. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

LLC Dominick Leali - Raymond James Financial, Inc. Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC Kyle William Rose - Canaccord Genuity, Inc. Suraj Kalia - Northland Securities, Inc. Operator : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Insulet Corporation First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Deborah R. Gordon - Insulet Corp.: Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2017 earnings call. Joining me today are Patrick Sullivan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Shacey Petrovic, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Michael Levitz, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The replay of this call will be archived on our website. Our press release discussing our first quarter 2017 results and second quarter and full year 2017 guidance is also available in the IR section of our website. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking, and involves known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to be materially different from any future results implied by such statements. Such factors include those referenced in our Safe Harbor statement, in our first quarter earnings release and in the company's filings with the SEC. With that, I'll turn the call over to Pat. Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: Thank you, Deb. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on the call today. I'll begin with a brief review of our first quarter performance and share recent business highlights and accomplishments. Mike will then discuss our first quarter financial results in more detail and provide our second quarter and updated full-year 2017 guidance. Shacey will then give an update on our exciting commercial and R&D progress and then we'll open the call up for questions. I'm once again thrilled with Insulet's performance. We exited 2016 with strong momentum exceeding expectations in each quarter and we are continuing this positive trend in 2017. We're executing on all of our commercial and operational strategies and making significant progress on all of our initiatives. We finished Q1 2017 with revenue of $102 million representing year-over-year growth of 25% and $4 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. Our gross margin for Q1 improved to over 58% from just one year ago and we are on track to achieve our long-term target of 65% Every area of our business delivered outstanding performance. U.S. Omnipod revenue was $60 million, a strong growth of 18% over the prior year. Our International Omnipod revenue was $25 million, a significant growth of over 60% versus the prior year. We achieved strong growth in our installed base in both the U.S. and internationally positioning us for our continued near- and long-term growth. Our Drug Delivery revenue was $17 million, in line with our expectations and representing growth of 12% over the prior year. This performance was primarily due to sales to Amgen and according to Amgen's most recent public commentary, sales of its Neulasta Onpro kit represented over 50% of the U.S. Neulasta doses at the end of the first quarter of 2017. This impressive growth trajectory was achieved in just over two years. Turning to some of the other highlights for the quarter. We continued to make significant progress on our manufacturing and supply chain initiatives. In 2016, these improvements resulted in dramatic gains in gross margin and allowed us to achieve an approximate 15% savings per pod. Our 2016 productivity, our line efficiency and reduction in scrap plus our ongoing improvement efforts continue to drive sustainable cost savings. At the end of 2016, we completed the beta launch of our product shipments from China to the United States via ocean freight. During the first quarter, we increased ocean shipments to approximately 30% of our first quarter manufactured volume for the United States. And we plan to increase this rate during the course of this year. As a reminder, we expect our move from air to ocean freight will have a positive partial-year impact to gross margin in 2017 of approximately half a point and on an annual basis, a positive impact to our gross margin of a full point. We are also incredibly excited about the progress we are making with our new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Massachusetts where we will install highly automated manufacturing lines, the first of which we expect to be operational in 2019. Turing to our innovation efforts, we're making significant progress on and are extraordinarily excited about introducing our Omnipod Dash product at the American Diabetes Association Trade Show in June. This will also be the technology platform for our artificial pancreas development program, which is progressing extremely well with very promising results to date. These development efforts will allow Insulet to maintain its competitive edge with truly innovative and differentiated products. Our significant product differentiation and the strength of our business model continue to insulate us from much of the distractions that exist in the diabetes market today. Our installed base is growing at a very strong rate and we remain fully on track to achieve our five-year target of $1 billion in revenue. Turning to Drug Delivery. In addition to our existing relationship with Amgen, we continue to work closely with many pharmaceutical partners for the delivery of a number of drugs using our Omnipod technology. We have a unique value proposition within this area of our business, and we are excited about the long-term potential and value-creation opportunity this business provides. And as I review the team's significant accomplishments, I'm very proud of their dedication, their hard work, strategic vision and extraordinarily high-quality execution. And I'm even more excited about what the future holds. We have put in place and are fully executing on a strong and robust strategy that has positioned Insulet for near and long-term growth and value creation. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike. Michael? Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: Thank you, Pat. I will review our first quarter results and then discuss our second quarter and full-year 2017 guidance. As I review our results, unless otherwise stated, all commentary regarding changes will be on a year-over-year basis. We are very pleased to report first quarter revenue growth of 25%, with revenue of $101.7 million compared to $81.2 million. All three of our product lines contributed meaningfully to this growth. We exceeded the midpoint of our stated guidance by $4 million with approximately two-thirds of the beat coming from U.S. Omnipod and one-third from International Omnipod, with both due to strong demand from our growing installed base. Our first quarter gross margin increased 420 basis points to 58.4% primarily from improvements we have made over the last year to our manufacturing and supply chain operations as well as improvements in product quality. Our operating expenses increased to $64.7 million compared to $51.8 million, and were consistent year-over-year as a percentage of revenues. The increase in spending reflects head count added over the last year to support the growth in our business, including increased investment in development and clinical work on our innovation projects, as well as the expansion of our commercial and operational infrastructure consistent with our stated plans and objectives. We ended the quarter with $254 million in cash and investment, compared to approximately $300 million at the end of 2016. The decrease is a result of capital expenditures primarily associated with our U.S. manufacturing project which is on plan and to a lesser extent working capital timing. We are very pleased with our strong financial position as we continue to make strategic investments in support of our near and longer term organic growth opportunities. I will now update you on our 2017 outlook. For the full year, we are raising the low end of our previously stated revenue range by $5 million, largely associated with International Omnipod sales. And we now expect revenue in a range of $425 million to $440 million, compared to revenue of $367 million, representing growth of 18% at the midpoint. This guidance reflects our expectation of continued strong growth across all of our business lines. First, we expect full year U.S. Omnipod in the range of $258 million to $265 million, representing growth of 14% at the midpoint. Second, we expect International Omnipod in the range of $97 million to $101 million, now representing growth of 38% at the midpoint. And third, we expect Drug Delivery in the range of $70 million to $74 million representing growth of 10% at the midpoint. For the second quarter of 2017, we expect revenue in the range of $104 million to $108 million, compared to $87.3 million and representing growth of 21% at the midpoint. This will be driven by continued strong growth across all of our business lines. First, we expect second quarter U.S. Omnipod in the range of $62.5 million to $64.5 million, representing growth of 13% at the midpoint. As we shared on our last earnings call, our U.S. Omnipod year-over-year growth is net of a two-point impact from the contractual expiration near the start of this year of a historic royalty rearrangement. Second, we expect International Omnipod in the range of $25 million to $26 million, representing growth of 54% at the midpoint. And third, we expect Drug Delivery in the range of $16.5 million to $17.5 million, representing growth of 18% at the midpoint. On gross margin, we are reaffirming our expectation that full year gross margin will increase significantly, approaching 60% for 2017 compared to 57.5% for 2016. This reflects the significant operational improvements we've made over the last year. We are extremely pleased with the tremendous progress to-date in margin expansion despite the unfavorable mix impact of better than expected international distributor revenue, which pressures overall gross margin. Our performance continues to support our multiyear gross margin target of 65%. To achieve our goals, we will continue to invest in our business to drive long-term growth and profitability, including commercial, research and development, and infrastructure investments. While our level of spend for the upcoming year may change, we are reaffirming our expectation of an approximate 20% to 25% increase in full year 2017 operating expenses from 2016. This will be driven largely by the increased spend we described to you last quarter to support our exciting product development and innovation pipeline. Expansion of our commercial team to meet our growing demand and investments in our manufacturing, supply chain operations and overall operational infrastructure. We continue to expect EBIT in 2017 to be roughly in line with 2016 and are on track with our goal of becoming sustainably EBIT positive beginning 2018. We also remain confident about reaching our longer term targets of $1 billion in revenue in five years with gross margin of 65% or higher, delivering above market profitability. I will now turn the call over to Shacey. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Thanks, Mike. 2017 is off to a terrific start with this successful first quarter. Our commercial strategies are driving robust revenue growth and a strong increase in our installed base. We also made substantial progress on innovation for both our diabetes and Drug Delivery businesses with great momentum headed into the remainder of this year. As I mentioned on our last call, our recurring revenue model makes installed base growth the best predictor of future revenue growth. We are affirming our full-year guidance of 20% growth in our installed base with 15% in the United States. In Q1, our installed base grew 15% year-over-year as we expected and our international installed base grew over 60% exceeding our expectation. Combined, this represents year-over-year growth in our global installed base of approximately 30% as of the end of the first quarter which drove our strong company revenue growth of 25%. As a reminder, our installed base is an estimate due to the fact that close to half of our U.S. sales and most of our international sales are through third-party distributors. The installed base estimate is net of attrition which remained consistent with previous quarters. The U.S. double-digit revenue growth was fueled by our investments to increase the field sales footprint, raise product awareness and improve market access for Omnipod. In Q1, we completed our sales force expansion and armed them with compelling data demonstrating the positive impact Omnipod has on a user's quality of life and reduction of burden for people living with diabetes. This expansion is driving increased penetration into existing endocrinology accounts and also growth into new accounts which had not previously prescribed Omnipod. Based on prior experience, we do not expect the new team to be at full productivity until Q4 but the increased field presence is already helping us to identify and train more new patients and clinicians on the value of Omnipod. And our supplemental efforts with Insulet Provided Glooko and direct-to-consumer advertising are attracting more potential patients into the funnel. In fact, the early results of our direct-to-consumer digital advertising campaign are encouraging. We're clearly increasing awareness among our targeted segment, the multiple daily injection user. This campaign is helping to educate MDI users on how Omnipod can give them better control, freedom and quality of life compared to other insulin delivery methods. In the last three months, we also made tangible progress on access and reimbursement for Omnipod. Our expanded market access team has developed a greater presence with insurance companies and state Medicaid programs. Our messaging of improved outcomes and quality of life for patients who migrate to Omnipod is being received very well. In particular, managed Medicaid programs, which tend to have high population turnover also find Omnipod's low upfront cost and pay-as-you-go business model compelling. As a result of our efforts, in Q1, we added access to 1.7 million lives for Omnipod, bringing our total to approximately 178 million covered lives or approximately 60% of all covered lives in the United States. Our international business continues to grow at an exciting pace, thanks to new markets like France and our direct market in Canada. We remain encouraged by the huge market opportunity for Omnipod in Europe. In addition to significant Omnipod growth in France, we continue to see strength within our core European markets namely the United Kingdom, Germany, and the Netherlands. Together, these countries represent the majority of our installed base in Europe, yet we are still underpenetrated in this region. There is tremendous untapped opportunity in markets outside of the United States, and this will be an attractive avenue for long-term growth for Omnipod. We continue to make great progress on our innovation road map, particularly our Dash Bluetooth connected platform, which we will be showcasing at ADA next month in San Diego. We have now tested Dash's modern, intuitive user interface with more than 100 consumers and clinicians. And the feedback has been incredibly enthusiastic. This system is designed to make insulin delivery even easier, and to serve as a platform for additional innovation like CGM integration with Dexcom, and our Omnipod Horizon automated glucose control system. We know that one of the barriers to adopting insulin delivery technology is the perceived complexity of these systems. Our new users tell us that one of the reasons they opt for Omnipod is that it is easy to use and Dash will strengthen this differentiation even further. Bluetooth in the pod and PDM will enable features like connectivity and secondary display on a user's mobile phone, and share/follow functionality for loved ones. User interface testing for the Dash system indicates that we have greatly reduced the time that it takes to perform common tasks on the handheld PDM, making the next-generation system even easier to use. On this same platform, we are developing Omnipod Horizon, our connected, automated glucose control system, in parallel with Dash. And this past quarter, we completed our second IDE study, which evaluated the system performance in increasingly challenging cases, including vigorous exercise, and high fat meals. We now have data on the performance of the algorithm from more than 80 patients across all age ranges, and the user feedback and clinical results have been terrific. Horizon data in pediatrics and adolescents will be presented at ADA next month. Again, this year, we will have a robust clinical presence at the meeting, with a total of four presentations, including new Omnipod data in research partnerships with centers of excellence across the United States and Europe. As a reminder, we're also innovating with Eli Lilly to use U200 and U500 concentrated insulins out of Omnipod. These advancements will enable us to better serve people with higher daily insulin requirements, including people living with insulin dependent type 2 diabetes. Our programs remain on track with the final U500 patient follow-up and clinical data compilation completing by the end of next year. We are in discussions with the FDA regarding U200 trial design and expect to start this clinical trial by early next year. We remain on target for 2019 and 2020 launches of these products, which will double our addressable market and be exciting growth catalysts for Omnipod. And lastly, our Drug Delivery team has made great progress with continued growth of our existing combination products and development of new ones. As Amgen mentioned on their last earnings call, its Neulasta Onpro kit now accounts for more than half of all U.S. Neulasta doses. The expertise that we've developed in innovating, improving and manufacturing the pod platform for our current customers has proven to be valuable to our pipeline partnership. The team continues to work with other pharmaceutical partners to leverage our precision Omnipod platform to provide an improved drug delivery experience for other medicines and we remain bullish on this exciting opportunity. Before I turn the call back over to Pat, let me just summarize by saying that Insulet is off to a great start for 2017. Our Omnipod and Drug Delivery businesses contributed terrific growth in Q1; and at the same time, we're making significant progress on our innovation programs to drive continued growth over the medium to long term. We are very well positioned to deliver attractive returns to our shareholders and deliver meaningful differentiated technology to the market. This is an exciting time at Insulet, and we're moving as fast as we can to make a difference for people living with diabetes and other conditions where the pod can improve outcomes and quality of life for our users. Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: Thanks, Shacey. Operator, we'll now open the call up for questions. Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird. Your line is now open. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thank you, guys. Good afternoon. Can you hear me okay? Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: Got you. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. Hey, Pat, just wondering on the guidance, if you could flesh out maybe your installed base guidance 30% growth this quarter, calling for 20% for the year. I don't think any of us think 60% is sustainable necessarily in the international markets but is that kind of the reason why the full year guidance may be a little bit below what you were able to put up in the first quarter? Does that international slow down a little bit? Or maybe you can flesh out also how you're thinking about U.S. installed base growth this year. Thank you. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. I can actually take that one, Jeff. This is Shacey. The installed base for the U.S., we're guiding to be consistent with what we guided at the beginning of the year. It's international where we're a little bit softer than the performance that we had this quarter and that's simply because it's early in the year and we're also in discussions with Ypsomed and so, that's reflected in that guidance. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah. That makes sense. And then, Shacey, maybe any insight you could provide on that 30% or so of your patients that you get from non-MDI every year, any change in mix of what pump companies those are coming from, your market share gains, how is it trending relative to Medtronic and then maybe some of the others, that would be helpful? Thanks. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. It's actually closer to 80% of our new users come to us from the multiple daily injection users as opposed to other pumps. That percentage hasn't changed materially. We remain focused on the MDI user. In terms of the mix of pumps that those come from, the vast majority are of Medtronic and I think that just reflects the market share in the market and that has not changed materially either. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Scott S. Wang - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. This is actually Scott Wang filling in for David. Just two quick questions for me. I guess, Shacey, starting with market dynamics, implied new patient starts were below expectations last quarter and could have been flattish. Can you give us any sense on how they've rebounded this quarter, either qualitatively or quantitatively? And how has the competitive impact trended from last year into this year? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. New patient starts grew nicely this quarter in line with our expectations. And in terms of competitive dynamics, I would say our pipeline is stronger than it has ever been. So, clearly, we're attracting new patients into the pipeline. And some of the delay in conversion has lightened in Q1 and continues to do so as we are even a month into this quarter. So, we're feeling very good about maintaining our guidance at the beginning of the year with a really strong pipeline and kind of reduced conversion rate time. Scott S. Wang - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. And then just one follow-up for me. Focusing on kind of ex-U.S. markets, performance was very strong again this quarter. Can you comment on what performance was like in new markets that you've entered such as France and Italy and how should we be thinking about the overall U.S. versus ex-U.S. mix for the year? Thank you. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: France is one of the newer markets that we've entered into. Very strong, really outsized expectations \u2013 or it's kind of out-achieved expectations for both I think Ypsomed as well as Insulet. And so that remains a great driver of the growth that we see internationally. But really, we see strength across all of our major markets internationally including the ones that I mentioned in Europe and Canada. And so, we continue to see that business outpace our U.S. business. And at the end of the year, I think I don't know where that lands us. I don't know, Mike, if you know off the top of your head. But we'll continue to see international grow nicely. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: Yeah, we described the installed base for the year growing 20% globally, 15% in the U.S. So, that would imply a higher growth rate for international, which is great in both our distributor markets and our direct markets internationally. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Robbie J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. This is Robbie Marcus in for Mike. Congrats on a good quarter. Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: Thank you. Robbie J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Maybe I can just ask I think what everyone's trying to get at a bit differently. So, I appreciate the color on the installed base, that's very helpful. But, as you guys have said many times, the installed base is more reflective of the longer term health of the business. But I think what most investors are focused on is the short-term considering the significant deceleration in U.S. new patient starts. And what's implied here in the first quarter internationally like something like a 40% increase in new patients quarter-over-quarter from fourth quarter. So, maybe considering 15% new patient growth, that could be anywhere from slightly down new patient growth to double-digit U.S. new patient growth. Can you help clarify especially given the slowdown in the fourth quarter? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Just to clarify, Robbie, we said 15% installed base growth, not patient start growth, right? Robbie J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. I'm asking if you can help clarify what happened in this quarter because the installed base is really just a reflection of multiple quarters. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: No, actually, the installed base growth is new patient starts minus attrition. And as I said, attrition remained relatively flat. So, we didn't have a deceleration of new patient starts. In fact, new patient starts grew nicely in line with our expectations in Q1 so I'm not sure if I'm missing something in your question. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: Well, I would also \u2013 Robbie, this is Mike. You had alluded to how installed base is indicative of longer term, but I think we would argue that installed base is is a driver of near term as well as long term. And in fact, if you look at the growth that we talked about here, Shacey mentioned in the U.S., 15% installed base growth as of the first quarter. And when you look at our revenue guidance for the United States, apart from the 2 point year-over-year comparative on royalty that went away earlier this year, well directly our growth is absolutely and directly in line with the installed base growth. So we're really excited about the momentum we've got in the growth of the business in the quarter and that's reflected in our revenue guidance. Robbie J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC : All right. Just to clarify, installed base growth is cumulative of all new patients from the first quarter last year through to first quarter this year where new patient starts is simply a reflection of this year versus last year? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Right. And I guess if you're looking for additional color, we're extremely pleased with the new patient growth in the U.S. It was in line with our expectations for the first quarter. Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: We're hitting on all cylinders, Robbie... Robbie J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Just a quick follow-up, based on your first quarter performance internationally and your second quarter guidance, it implies somewhere around $47 million in international sales for the back half of the year, which would be 18% year-over-year growth versus 58% in the first half. So I was just hoping you might be able to help clarify what's driving the deceleration in the back half of the year? Thanks. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: Robbie, this is Mike. As a reminder, we entered into \u2013 we're entering the new markets we, over the last number of years and one of which that was mentioned by an earlier question was France. We entered into France. Principally, the growth in France started in the second half of last year. And so, when you have the comparatives on a year-over-year basis, of course, the growth is going to go down because we didn't have France in the first half of the year principally. And so, that's the driver for which you're describing. But we are thrilled with how things are going internationally in our existing markets, and in new markets like France, and that's reflected in the strong revenue guidance that we have for the year for international. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Tao Levy with Wedbush. Your line is now open. Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Good afternoon. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Hi, Tao. Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: Hi, Tao. Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Two questions for me. First, just looking at Drug Delivery. So, if we annualize the first quarter, you're going to end up a tad below your guidance range. So, curious to see what is going to accelerate that or what you think could accelerate that in the back half of the year? And I wasn't sure if maybe you're expecting contribution from the other product that you sell internationally with Ferring? Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: Tao, this is Mike. So, we take orders from Amgen and that's what our guidance is based on. As we mentioned in the earlier comments, they've been describing very exciting growth and that's reflected in their orders to us. So, we are very comfortable with the guidance for the year and differences by quarter, we try and work with them to even it out, so that we can optimize manufacturing, but there is sometimes differences in timing and that's all that's reflected in the numbers so far versus what we're describing for the rest, but we are comfortable with the guidance for the year. Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then secondly for Shacey, maybe, on the attrition front, you mentioned that attrition is pretty flattish versus what you've seen in the past. Where is that attrition mainly coming from these days? Is it from new patients that may have tried the product three months ago and now decided it's not the right pump for them or are you seeing attrition from patients who'd been on it for a year or two years, more experienced users? Thanks. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure, Tao. Most of what drives attrition is market access and the price experience. So, patient who losses coverage for example which is one of the reasons why we made such an investment in growing that team and trying to expand and improve coverage for Omnipod and then the rest of the driver is the product experience and product quality. I wouldn't say that attrition comes more from a new user versus an experienced user. It's just by a number of users who are impacted by those two factors. We have made a great effort focused on new patient, meaning attrition in the first 90 days of the user experience, and we've seen some positive momentum there. But for now, we'd really don't see a change in the overall annual attrition of the user base, which has remained pretty steady. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open Ryan Blicker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi, this is Ryan on for Doug. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just starting with the sales force expansion you guys have going, can you give an update on how that's going? And yeah, I'll stop there. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. That expansion has gone really, really well. We were able to attract I think a super talented team and get them up and running more quickly than many of us thought we might be able to. So, that expansion is now complete. It was completed really in the first quarter. And so, those folks have been trained and they're out there kind of developing their territories, et cetera. So, that, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that has enabled us to actually find many physicians who weren't previously prescribing Omnipod. So, we're seeing some expansion of the endocrinology user base, as well as just continued penetration into our existing account. So, I'm excited about the value that will drive. But based on our last two expansions, we don't really expect this team to be at full productivity again until the end of the year. So, we won't see the vast majority of that impact until late this year, early next. Ryan Blicker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Got it. And then on Drug Delivery, you said you continue to work with multiple other pharma partners outside of your currently commercial partners. I know it's not in your control but do you think we could hear more information about what you're working on during 2017 or maybe 2018? Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: This is Pat. I think in terms of communicating with the Street on our progress in Drug Delivery, 2018 is probably more likely. But I would like to just say that our outlook for Drug Delivery is extraordinarily bright. And we are very pleased with the progress to-date both with Amgen and with Ferring Pharmaceutical, our two commercial partners that we have at this moment. This business is different than the Omnipod business that you really need to match the drug delivery technology and capabilities that we bring to the party with the market needs and technical requirements of the pharmaceutical companies. So, it really is matching our capabilities with the market set of opportunities out there. We're very pleased with the progress we've made, with the pipeline that we have. But just given the confidential nature of these relationships with our pharma partners, it's unlikely we're going to be able to give any more than we've already given you, but I would say that we're very confident in our Drug Delivery business providing meaningful revenue to achieve our goal of $1 billion in revenue in 2021. Ryan Blicker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. That was helpful. And maybe if I could... Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: Second follow-up again. (35:52) Ryan Blicker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Dominick Leali with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Dominick Leali - Raymond James Financial, Inc.: Hi, guys. This is Dominick in for Jayson. I just had a couple of quick ones here. I want to make sure that the timeline for Dash, is that still on track for I think it was a 3Q filing a soft launch in 4Q and then a more broader launch early next year? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. I would say we're pretty much on track and we will be showcasing at ADA and that we're on track to submit in the second half. So depending on FDA review, we'd be on the market late this year or early next. But I guess just as a reminder because of our recurring revenue model, an acceleration of a couple of months or deceleration of a couple of months, doesn't materially impact the revenue picture in the short term. But that said, we're really excited about the next generation platform so we're working hard to get it out there as soon as possible. But we continue to get feedback from all of our users in the development process and we're going to make sure that we launch the best possible products. So if that means we're a couple of weeks or a month delayed in the submission to the FDA then so be it, we're going to have the best product on the market possible. Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: And we're excited about showing it to you at the upcoming ADA Meeting in San Diego. I think you'd be really excited as well. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. You guys are all going to get your hands on it. It's pretty cool. Dominick Leali - Raymond James Financial, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks. And then I was wondering if there was any update on the commercial launch strategy of the Dash? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: That's an interesting question. We've been working hard on that as well. That's not something we've given a lot of color around. And I think for competitive reasons, we probably will refrain from doing that. But as we get closer to the midst of the launch, we'll certainly give you guys a little bit more color. But we have been thinking about some new interesting models and ways to really I guess get patients access to the technology. So, good question but I guess I'd say stay tuned at this point. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy with Leerink Partners. Your line is now open. Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC : Good afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question and congrats on a really good quarter. I was just wondering a few things, first of all, other pump companies had a tough quarter from what we could tell; Tandem, Animas. Not asking you to necessarily comment on their performance specifically, Shacey, but clearly, it seems like Insulet's not really seeing the same impact. Can you talk about any of the trends in the quarter for the pump market as a whole? What are you guys seeing from a share perspective and maybe comment on the early days of competitive launch? And what's happening in the market there? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure, Danielle. I think the difference in the impact to some of our tube pump companies on the market versus Omnipod is reflective of three things. One is our continued focus on the multiple daily injection user, I mean that is our target segment. And I don't think that's necessarily the case for the other companies out there. So, I think it speaks to the strength of that strategy. And then \u2013 obviously we have a very differentiated platform and differentiated business model, and I think that's the other thing that you see in this, just with the recurring revenue model, you don't have any particular impact in a quarter that could be something that could be disastrous for the capital models that are out in the marketplace. And then the third thing is, we have a very strong international business which isn't the case for some of our partners as well. And obviously the competitive dynamics in that market are a little bit different. So, I think all three of those things are contributing to the fact that we're not seeing the same impact that some of the other companies are. In terms of the competitive dynamics, I mean certainly there's a lot of noise on the market about the limited market release that's currently underway with 670G. But that noise has really lightened up in terms of our field feedback, again primarily because we're focused on a target segment that is different than the target segment that that product is focused toward. So, I think that that's what's driving our success and I guess the limited impact or negligible impact that we've seen. Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And then just one quick follow up on the U200 and U500 programs. Shacey, wondering if you could give any color on the size and scope of those trials, when we could possibly see data from those and how to think about a launch into type 2 patients. From a strategic perspective, it seems likely a tougher patient population to crack. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. So just to clarify on that last piece of your question, so the type 2 population that we're targeting is the insulin dependent type 2 patient population. In some cases physicians say that they can't really even differentiate between a type 1 and a type 2. You'll hear the term type 1.5 sometimes referred to patients who are difficult to diagnose as one or the other .And so, this is a patient population where the vast majority of them in fact our data says 83% of this patient population is in the endocrinology office. So, we are not planning on entering into new physician channels or trying to go after the primary care type 2 market, which has different needs and a different access point. This population of patients is very much similar to the type 1 patient population in terms of how frequently they're seeing an endocrinology office and also the type of flexibility that they need in their insulin delivery. So probably not as much of a departure as one might expect. In terms of the data and the programs, the data \u2013 the clinical trials are being managed by Lilly, so that really is in their hands in terms of when and if they'll make the data public. But we would expect U500 data to become available next year. Whether or not they decide to present that at ADA or other conferences, I think remains to be seen and we'll work with Lilly to support them in any way we can to make that happen. But the data, the scope of the trials, similar to what you see in this space, so hundreds of patients not anything more than that. And we're excited about the impact that these have for our business and also just for patients out there that we can better serve with higher daily insulin requirements. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. I wonder if I could just follow up a couple of questions on the international performance. I almost hate to ask this but there was a time previous to the current management obviously when really strong international results sort of masked what was some stocking on the part of your international distributor. And I'm curious, again, just given the lack of visibility into where they're actually selling through, what gives you the strong confidence that we're not seeing stocking again with these really strong results. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: I think the first indicator is just the growth in the installed base which is very much in line with the growth of the revenue. And we get good data from our distributors in terms of number of patients and installed growth. So, we're pretty confident in that data. So, you have that visibility that there's really nice alignment there. Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: And this is Mike, I would also just make the point. We watch this closely and are very clear to avoid any stocking in the channel. And so, I think you can see that from the installed base data, but that's also just an approach to how we run the business. Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC : No, like I said I almost hated asking, but just on Ypsomed as well. I guess the contract is coming up for renegotiation, and I know you probably won't give us much but what are the thoughts or plans there, at this point, as we're heading into that for the end of 2017? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Well, we're in active discussions with Ypsomed about next steps with the agreement, whether we extend or pick some alternative path. And because we're in active discussions, we really can't comment much. But I will say that both Insulet and Ypsomed are entirely committed to making sure that patients have continuity of care regardless of the outcome. And we just want to find the best way forward for both us. Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC : I guess, well, do you have a preferred outcome, though? I mean is your desire ultimately go direct at some point in these international markets, or would you rather sort of limit them to Europe and you can take the rest of the international market? Or is there any sort of preferred path you're willing to share with us at this point? Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: I would just reiterate what Shacey said. It really is having the best interest of the patients in the installed base in Europe as the number one consideration. And I think the second is understanding the economics for each of us. And it's the combination of those two that would drive us to make the decision. But it's primarily going to be the continuity of care for our patients with the great installed base that Ypsomed has provided for in Europe. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Kyle Rose with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open. Kyle William Rose - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much for taking the question. Can you hear me all right? Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: Got you. Kyle William Rose - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: So, Pat, so historically, you've talked about CMS being a market opportunity and I don't want to rehash all of the moving pieces there. But I just wondered if maybe you could comment on \u2013 when you think about your underlying attrition and the amount of people that are current customers that are aging into Medicare, maybe just talk to us about how much of an impact that has on your underlying user base. And then how we should think about the potential for CMS to come into the story over the course of 2017? Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: Great. I thought I would get by maybe not have to answer this question, but I'm glad you asked it. If you come back to Shacey's metric in her prepared remarks, 178 million covered lives that represented about 60% of the market. When you combine Medicare and Medicaid, it makes up another 30% or so of market potential that we currently do not have access to even though we've been reasonably successful with some of the state Medicaid plans. Having said that, it is remarkable that patients when they age into Medicare lose access to the Omnipod technology even though they would be provided an alternative tube pump on a Medicare Part B. I was extremely hopeful to get a decision by the end of last year before the change in administration. And I think what happened is as that change in administration occurred, many of the decisions related to coverage and sort of what I would call routine decisions of CMS were basically put on hold, although they did describe to us that they would like to get this resolved quickly. I think where we are today with CMS, we have a very strong position with coverage of Omnipod under either Medicare Part B or Part D and I have every confidence we're going to get Medicare coverage, although I think it's just the description of our product probably fits a little more nicely into the Medicare Part D. But we have \u2013 and I think Medicare has the authority under either one of those providers coverage and we're working very actively with CMS and hope to get this resolved quickly. Kyle William Rose - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. No, I appreciate the additional color there. And then just wanted to ask another question on the underlying new patient growth in the U.S. Just obviously, strong growth particularly when you think about the rest of the players there, 80% coming from the MDI side. Just wondering if you could talk about what the main drivers of that new patient growth is. Obviously, you're investing in the sales channel and some DTC marketing but just what are the types of patients we're seeing? Is it more children versus adults, more adolescence? Just kind of help us think about what those new patients really look like? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. We did see growth across our age ranges and in fact, we're probably a little bit lighter this quarter. I mean it just shifts every quarter in pediatrics than typical. And I think that is a reflection of the volume that DTC is driving. Although that's my anecdotal feedback, I don't have direct evidence of that but it does seem that our advertising is engaging patients a bit earlier in the pipeline and their awareness of their different choices, et cetera. And I think that \u2013 because we're focused on digital channels and social media, we're just naturally getting an older age range in that group. But yeah, no, I think not much has changed in terms of the type of customer. We continue to target MDI, and that continues to make up the vast majority of our new users. I think we're just catching them at a different point in their awareness and decision-making process, thanks to the investment that we're making in the digital advertising campaign. We continue to evaluate how that's tracking on the different channels in which we're advertising. And we'll continue to sort of optimize that investment based on the return that it's providing. But so far, we're encouraged and pretty optimistic about what it can provide for us over the longer term. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Suraj Kalia with Northland Securities. Your line is now open Suraj Kalia - Northland Securities, Inc.: Good afternoon, everyone. Congrats on a nice quarter. Can you hear me okay? Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: Absolutely. Loud and clear. Thanks. Suraj Kalia - Northland Securities, Inc.: Perfect. So, Pat and Shacey, two questions. First, Omnipod right now does not have Medicare reimbursement. Can you give us some color on the reason Medicare payment delays for CGMs, and we started getting a lot of questions about how that could affect Omnipod? Any color from you all would be great. And the second part of it, Shacey, specifically, have you reached an asymptotic level on Neulasta prescriptions? It seems like last quarter was a little greater than 50%, now we have a little greater than 50%. How do you see this playing out as the year progresses? Thank you for taking my questions. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Great. You want to take Medicare? Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. Let me take Medicare first. The most important thing we have to get done first is to get a coverage decision from Medicare. And as I said, I'm very confident in our position with Medicare and we've been working with the career staffers, even though there was a change in the administration. The career staffers are the ones that have done a remarkable job I think of managing the process with CMS. And in terms of payments, after a coverage decision is made, it will depend upon whether it is which Medicare it is whether it's Part B or Part D, there are different processes that are put in place for payment decisions at that point in time. But I guess I'd just say, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it hopefully soon. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: And in terms of the Neulasta Onpro kit, it's really probably a good question for Amgen. Certainly, we see that there's been terrific continued growth of this product and it continues to grow quarter-after-quarter, so I don't know that we think we're approaching some sort of steady state at this point there. It's a terrific product and there's really no reason why we shouldn't continue to see the technology grow. But that's my perspective. Amgen's probably better prepared to comment on it. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Robbie J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for taking the follow up. Just wanted to ask on the cash burn. It was $44 million this quarter. You said some of it was due to CapEx. But it's a big number I think more than people are expecting. So wonder if you could just clarify a bit and then maybe give us your expectations for the full year for cash use? Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: Robbie, this is Mike. So I will tell you that our spending is right in line with our expectations. When we talked about the expectations for the year, we said we were going to be spending money to establish our U.S. manufacturing. When we did the capital raise in September of last year, that was one of the primary stated purpose of it and we're right in line with, as I said in my prepared remarks, we are right on plan and really excited about the direction that's going. In the first quarter, there was some timing on working capital, nothing that changes anything about how we're viewing the numbers for the year, so everything that we've said in our guidance last quarter is still the same. And we're very pleased with our strong financial position. Robbie J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And one last quick one. At the recent AAC meeting, there was a presentation by a doctor talking about a competitor pump from Medtronic that might be on the market potentially by the end of 2018 with corrective boluses. Just wanted to get the latest thoughts on when your product might be available in the U.S. and how \u2013 if a product's on the market before you with corrective boluses, would you still come to market as is or would you look to change your product to catch up? Thanks. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Thanks, Robbie. I appreciate the question and the opportunity to talk a bit about our Horizon product. We're really excited about the progress that we're making. You'll see, I think, pretty impressive data at ADA, just in a few weeks now in San Diego. And we should be entering a pre-pivotal later this year and entering into pivotal next year in our plan. And we're very much on track as to be in the market in 2019 in the U.S. And yes, we will still bring our product to market. We fully expect that it will be differentiated even from the technology that you're describing, the next-generation 690G. We will have some significant differentiation from that product and we expect to be more appealing to certain segments of the market for certain. So, stay tuned and hopefully you'll be at ADA to see the presentations of the data. Operator : And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Patrick Sullivan. Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: Thank you, operator. I will once again finish where I started on the conference call by saying that I'm extremely pleased with Insulet's performance so far in 2017, and I'm very confident this trend will continue. Simply put, we have the right team in place to drive significant performance and success, and we have the right tools in place to win and to achieve our goal of $1 billion in revenue by 2021. As always, I would like to close by thanking the Insulet employees for all of their hard work and dedication, to ease the burden and improve the lives of people living with diabetes and other diseases. I'd also like to thank everyone for joining us on the call today, and we look forward to sharing with you our progress during what I know will be a very exciting 2017. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

Suraj Kalia - Northland Securities, Inc. Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q2 2017 Insulet Corporation Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Deborah Gordon, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin. Deborah R. Gordon - Insulet Corp.: Thank you, Bruce. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2017 earnings call. Joining me today are Patrick Sullivan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Shacey Petrovic, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Michael Levitz, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The replay of this call will be archived on our website. Our press release discussing our second quarter 2017 results and third quarter and full year 2017 guidance is also available in the IR section of our website. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and involves known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to be materially different from any future results implied by such statements. Such factors include those referenced in our Safe Harbor statement, in our second quarter earnings release and in the company's filings with the SEC. With that, I'll turn the call over to Pat. Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: Thank you, Deb. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. I'll begin with comments on the exciting news we released to the market on July 20, to directly distribute the Omnipod in Europe. And then, I'll provide a brief review of our second quarter performance and share our recent business highlights. Mike will then provide more detail on our second quarter financial results, our guidance for Q3 and full year 2017. Shacey will follow up on our commercial and R&D progress and then we'll open the call for questions. July 20 was a day of significant transformation in Insulet's history. On that day, we announced our decision to directly sell the Omnipod System in Europe. This move will significantly accelerate our revenue growth and further improve our gross margin profile, when this transition is complete. And when combined with other steps we're taking, our gross margin will expand from 50% in 2015 to nearly 70% in 2021, a remarkable 2,000 basis point improvement. We are absolutely positively thrilled to go direct in Europe. This move will allow us to be close to our customers, have control over our existing and future markets, significantly improve our gross margins, and increase value for our shareholders. To be clear, this was a well-considered and extensively evaluated decision. Since the day I arrived at Insulet nearly three years ago, we have analyzed and exhausted a number of opportunities to best serve our European customers and capitalize on the significant international opportunities. Our exclusive distributor has done a fine job establishing a large, growing and incredibly loyal Omnipod customer base in Europe. Our decision came down to control, execution, margin expansion, and shareholder value creation. There is absolutely no question that this is the right decision and the right time to go direct in Europe. As Shacey will explain in more detail, we have spent the last two years evaluating and preparing for this opportunity. And while there may be some short-term disruptions, there is no scenario that results in anything less than significant financial growth and value creation for Insulet and our shareholders. We already have a highly talented team on the ground in Europe, executing a detailed transition plan We are absolutely confident that we will successfully transition the business and continue to profitability grow and expanding international markets. I'll now provide some details on our impressive second quarter results. I'm once again pleased with Insulet's strong performance. And, as a result of this performance and our outlook for the future, we're raising full year revenue guidance to $440 million to $450 million, a raise of $13 million between the midpoint of the previous and this new guidance. We finished Q2 2017 with revenue of $110 million, a year over revenue growth of 26% and $4 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. Our Q2 gross margin continued to improve. And a result of our plans to go direct internationally, when combined with the operational improvements we continue to make, we now have a clear line-of-sight to gross margin approaching 70% in 2021, a 500 basis point improvement from our previous target of 65%. In Q2, every area of our business delivered outstanding performance. U.S. Omnipod revenue was over $65 million, delivering a strong growth of 16% year-over-year. International Omnipod revenue was almost $27 million, a significant growth of 60% versus the prior year, the result of continued very strong adoption in France. We achieved strong growth in our installed base in both the U.S. and internationally during the quarter and are increasing our year-over-year worldwide installed base growth expectation to 25%, up from 20%. Our Drug Delivery revenue was $18 million, in line with our expectations, and representing solid growth of 23% over the prior year. We continue to make significant progress in our manufacturing and supply chain initiatives, resulting in continued improvement in gross margin and improved quality of our products. Our manufacturing processes and ongoing improvement efforts continue to reduce scrap, increase productivity, improve line efficiency, and drive sustainable cost savings. During the second quarter, we shifted more of our freight shipments from air to ocean and will continue to increase this rate during the balance of this year. And as discussed previously, we expect our move from air to ocean will improve our gross margin on an annual basis by approximately 100 basis points and for 2017 will be at approximately 50 basis points. We're also pleased with the progress we're making on the build out of our new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Massachusetts, where we will install two highly automated lines with our first schedule to come online in 2019. We're making significant progress on the development of our Omnipod Dash product. We performed market research on Dash at the ADA tradeshow in June and received terrific feedback from clinicians. I'm very proud of the extraordinary efforts of our cross-functional teams to ensure we will have a high quality product that exceeds our customers' expectations. The Dash is a technology platform for all of our future innovations, the U200, the U500 and the Horizon Automated Glucose Control System. These development efforts will allow Insulet to maintain its competitive edge with truly differentiated and the innovative products. In Drug Delivery, Amgen's Onpro kit reached 55 conversions at the end of the second quarter and I'm sure all of you have seen in the last direct-to-consumer advertising campaign on television. We continue to work with pharmaceutical companies for the delivery of drugs using our Omnipod technology. We have a unique value proposition in Drug Delivery and we remain excited about the long-term potential and value creation opportunity this business provides. I'm very proud of the performance of the company over the past three years. When you compare our revised 2017 revenue and gross margin guidance to the 2014 results, we have nearly doubled the top line and improved gross margin by 10 percentage points. Now we are well on our way to achieve our five-year target of $1 billion in revenue, gross margins approaching 70% and above market profitability. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike. Michael? Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: Thank you, Pat. I will review our second quarter results and then discuss our third quarter and full year 2017 guidance. I will also give some color on the expected impact of our recently announced assumption of direct distribution in Europe in mid-2018. As I review our results, unless otherwise stated, all commentary regarding changes will be on a year-over-year basis. We are very pleased to report second quarter revenue growth of 26%, with revenue of $109.8 million compared to $87.3 million. All three of our product lines contributed meaningfully to this growth. We exceeded the midpoint of our stated guidance by $4 million with half of the beat coming from U.S. Omnipod and the remainder split between international Omnipod and Drug Delivery due to strong demand across our business. Our gross margin increased by over 100 basis points to 58.9%, primarily from improvements we have made over the last year to our manufacturing and supply chain operations, as well as improvements to product quality, offset in part by unfavorable mix due to higher international distributor sales. Our operating expenses increased to $68 million compared to $51.7 million and were consistent year-over-year as a percentage of revenues. The increase in spending reflects head count that we've added over the last year to support the growth in our business, including increased investment in development and clinical work on our exciting innovation projects, as well as the expansion of our commercial and operational infrastructure, consistent with our stated plans and objectives. We ended the quarter with over $258 million in cash and investments compared to approximately $300 million at the end of last year. The decrease is a result of our capital expenditures, primarily associated with investments in our U.S. manufacturing project, which continues on plan. Our cash and investments also reflect continued strong days sales outstanding as well as stable inventory levels, even with the significant growth of our business. We are very pleased with our strong financial position, as we continue to make strategic investments in support of our near and longer-term organic growth opportunities. I will now update you on our 2017 outlook. For the full year, given our better than expected revenue to-date and the strong momentum across all of our business lines, we are raising for revenue outlook to be in the range of $440 million to $450 million compared to our previous range of $425 million to $440 million. The $12.5 million raise at the midpoint is largely associated with stronger Omnipod demand in both the United States and international markets. The revised guidance compares to 2016 revenue of $367 million and represents growth of 21% at the midpoint. First, we now expect full year U.S. Omnipod revenue in the range of $263 million to $268 million, representing growth of 16% at the midpoint. Second, we expect international Omnipod in the range of $105 million to $108 million, now representing growth of 48% at the midpoint. And third, we expect Drug Delivery in the range of $72 million to $74 million, representing growth of 12% at the midpoint. For the third quarter of 2017, we expect revenue in the range of $112 million to $116 million compared to $94.8 million, representing growth of 20% at the midpoint. This will be driven by continued strong growth across all of our business lines. First, we expect third quarter U.S. Omnipod revenue in the range of $67 million to $69 million, representing growth of 14% at the midpoint. As a reminder, our U.S. Omnipod growth this year is net of a 2 point unfavorable impact from the expiration of a historic royalty arrangement. Second, we expect international Omnipod in the range of $27 million to $28 million, representing growth of 44% at the midpoint. And third, we expect Drug Delivery in the range of $18 million to $19 million, representing growth of 15% at the midpoint. On gross margin, we are reaffirming our expectation that 2017 full year gross margin will approach 60%, up significantly compared to our reported 57.5% last year. This reflects the significant operational improvements we've made, partially offset by the unfavorable mix of international distributor revenue. We are extremely pleased with the tremendous progress to-date in margin expansion. To achieve our goals, we will continue to invest in our business to drive long-term growth and profitability, including commercial, research and development, and infrastructure investments. We now expect full year 2017 operating expenses to increase between 25% to 30% from 2016, up from our previous range of 20% to 25%, but lower as a percentage of revenue, reflecting initial cost to expand our European infrastructure as well as higher performance-based incentive expenses. Consistent with our previously stated guidance, we expect full year 2017 EBIT to be roughly in line with last year. Given the plan in mid-2018 to assume direct commercial responsibility over our European Omnipod business, we'd now like to give you some color on how we expect this change to impact our 2018 results compared to historical trends. From a revenue standpoint, while customer pricing in Europe is on average 20% lower than our pricing in the United States, the move to end-user pricing represents an increase of over 50% as compared to our existing distributor pricing. As such, beginning in the second half of 2018, when we no longer sell through our current distributor, we expect a material increase in our revenue run rate. Even with the expectation that our newly established European sales force will not reach full productivity for approximately one year and expecting that Omnipod's significant installed base growth in France will eventually moderate. We are extremely excited about the opportunity to drive continued strong revenue growth outside the United States with the direct sales force focused on Omnipod and with innovation targeted for our global markets. From a gross margin standpoint, given the increased revenues once we transition to a direct model in Europe, we expect our total company gross margin to increase by approximately 400 basis points on a full year basis, with half of that expected for calendar year 2018, assuming a mid-year transition. As a result, as Pat mentioned, we are now raising our long-term total company gross margin targets from 65% to approaching 70%. From an operating expense standpoint, we expect the change to a direct model will result in incremental annual run rate operating expenses of approximately $45 million to $50 million. In addition, we expect non-recurring expenses associated with the transition to include approximately $10 million of start-up costs, as well as a fee payable to our current distributor. That fee is determined based on the number of Omnipods we sell in the 12 months following the June 30, 2018 contract expiration to customers who had previously purchased their Omnipods from our distributor. Assuming the continued growth of Omnipod in Europe through mid-2018, and limited attrition in the 12 months thereafter, we estimate this fee could total approximately $50 million. Excluding these anticipated non-recurring expenses, we expect the assumption of direct commercial operations in Europe will be accretive to total company earnings and we continue to expect to be EBIT positive in 2018. We also remain confident about reaching our longer-term targets of $1 billion in revenue in 2021 with gross margins now expected to approach 70% and above market profitability. This is a very exciting time for Insulet as we drive significant revenue growth, make the pivot to profitability and deliver differentiated innovation to our customers worldwide. I will now turn the call over to Shacey. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Thanks, Mike. We have completed the first half of 2017 with strong results and we're headed into the second half with incredible momentum. Second quarter results were once again terrific. Our commercial strategies continue to drive robust revenue growth and a sizable increase in our installed base. We also made substantial progress on innovation and operational initiatives, particularly with our Omnipod Dash and Horizon programs. As a result of the tremendous growth we're experiencing internationally, we are increasing our full year 2017 expectation to approximately 25% year-over-year growth in our global Omnipod installed base. We're reaffirming the expected growth of 15% in our U.S. installed base. And we're raising our estimate of the international installed base growth to over 40% from our prior assumption of 30%. As a reminder, because of Omnipod's recurring revenue model, installed base growth is the best predictor of revenue growth. In Q2, our U.S. installed base grew approximately 15% year-over-year, as we expected, and our international installed base grew more than 70%, exceeding our expectation. Combined, this represents year-over-year growth in our global installed base of approximately 35% as of the end of the second quarter, which drove our strong company revenue growth. Our U.S. revenue growth was fueled by the investments we have made to increase field sales footprint, raise product awareness, and broaden market access. These efforts are driving improved account penetration and are attracting more potential new users to Omnipod. Our pipeline is the strongest it has been in company history. We're clearly increasing awareness among our targeted segment, multiple daily injection users. Direct-to-consumer digital advertising is helping to educate MDI users on how Omnipod can give them better control, freedom and quality of life compared to other insulin delivery methods. And our field team is driving increased advocacy and utilization among physicians. On top of attracting new customers, we continue to focus on improved market access and reimbursement, because this impacts customer experience and retention. Our team has been capitalizing on Omnipod's distinct product advantages and low upfront cost to expand Medicaid access for Omnipod. In Q2, we added access to 2 million covered lives, primarily for Medicaid beneficiaries, bringing our total U.S. Omnipod access to 180 million lives, or approximately 58% of all covered lives in the United States. Also, this quarter, we were thrilled to welcome Bret Christensen, as our new Chief Commercial Officer. Bret brings decades of commercial leadership and success to Insulet. And he has hit the ground running, as expected. In particular, his experience and expertise in consumer marketing, sales force optimization, and wining in highly competitive markets is already driving value for the organization. Bret leads all commercial operations and teams for the United States and Canada. While commercial execution, an improved customer experience, and increased market access drive growth in the near-term, our innovative product development pipeline will fuel growth in 2018 and beyond. This quarter we made great headway on our innovation roadmap, particularly, with Omnipod Dash, which we unveiled at ADA for market research. As a reminder, Omnipod Dash includes our Bluetooth connected Android-based Personal Diabetes Manager. Dash will provide users with improved simplicity and ease-of-use through a modern touch-screen device wirelessly connected to our Bluetooth-enabled pod. Dash is the platform for our future innovation, including concentrated insulin and our Horizon Automated Glucose Control System. By moving to this Bluetooth platform, we are able to liberate the data in our PDM and pod to provide mobile dashboard displays for Podders, mobile apps for caregivers and data and insights for patients, physicians and payers. This platform also allows us to integrate with Bluetooth-enabled sensors, including Dexcom's G5 and G6 which are incorporated into our Omnipod Horizon programs. Our introduction of Dash at ADA was a huge success. While more than 100 end-users have already been involved in the development of Dash, we took the opportunity to collect additional market research from ADA attendees that focused on preferred product features and the Dash user interface. This feedback was overwhelmingly positive. 94% of participants indicated that Dash was a significant improvement over the current Omnipod system. 90% agreed that Dash was the right platform for future Omnipod innovation. And 80% said that Dash would be even easier to train on than the current Omnipod System and will allow more healthcare providers to treat more patients with pod therapy. It's terrific to see clinician feedback on Dash mirror the enthusiasm expressed by our Podders who have tested this platform as part of our research and development process. We are on track with Dash development and expect to submit to the FDA in Q4. In addition to the exciting Dash feedback at ADA, we also highlighted the progress that we've made on Omnipod Horizon Automated Glucose Control System, including its impressive clinical performance. We conducted a Product Theater to share relevant data, progress on development and to complete market research on the Omnipod Horizon user interface. This event was standing room only and attracted over 400 attendees. Based on the participant feedback we collected, the diabetes clinical community is eagerly anticipating the introduction of Horizon. We are making rapid strides towards commercial launch and recently started our third IDE study for Horizon, which is enrolling 48 patients across three centers and is expected to be fully completed by October. Patients in this IDE trial are spending a longer time in our hybrid closed-loop phase and it is taking place in a hotel setting instead of a clinical research center. Our concentrated insulin development program with Eli Lilly to use U500 and U200 insulin out of Omnipod remain on track. As a reminder, concentrated insulins enable us to better serve people with higher daily insulin requirements, including people living with insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes. These products, which will enter the market in 2019 and 2020, will more than double our addressable market and have the potential to be significant growth catalysts for Omnipod. Results of our Drug Delivery business remain strong, supported by the market's continued adoption of Amgen's Neulasta Onpro kit. As Amgen mentioned on their last earnings call, its Neulasta Onpro kit now accounts for approximately 55% of all U.S. Neulasta doses. This remarkable growth in adoption is a testament to the value of the pod for delivering medicines other than insulin. And we continue to make good progress on the clinical development programs underway with other pharmaceutical partners. We believe Drug Delivery represents a tremendous opportunity for longer-term growth. Last, but certainly not least, we are thrilled to assume the distribution and commercial support for our Omnipod users in Europe in July of 2018. Early on in his tenure, Pat recognized our international Omnipod opportunity and business model as having potential to drive significant additional value for Insulet. Pat and I each have built and run European businesses and our executive team has substantial international experience, building and growing businesses across all major global markets. Our team understands and appreciates Europe's uniqueness and its considerable prospects. For the better part of two years, we've been evaluating and preparing for this potential move. We have now established an office and team in the United Kingdom, including human resources, regulatory, quality and commercial leadership. And we are leveraging our European Physician Advisory Board, third-party and internal market expertise and our rapidly-growing commercial partners to ensure we have a successful transition of the business. With the guidance of these subject matter experts, we have developed a deep understanding of the patient journey in the various markets across Europe. We're using these insights to formalize our key processes and operations at the country and Pan-European levels. Our immediate focus is on providing continuity of care for our existing customer base. And then, we will drive further penetration and expansion into our considerable international market opportunity. Today, Omnipod is sold in 13 European countries with the vast majority of the use occurring in four markets : France, the Netherlands, Germany, and the United Kingdom. For one-time clarity sake and to help you with your modeling, our European distributors' best estimate is that there are approximately 50,000 Omnipod users in Europe. Our largest and fastest-growing European market is France, which represents almost one-third of our European business and is highly concentrated, where distribution, training, and customer support are managed by home healthcare providers or (27:42). This reduces the business transition risk for us since no manufacturer sells or markets directly to the patient. Instead, patients in France choose the technology they prefer and they are overwhelmingly choosing Omnipod. Additional risk mitigation is expected as a result of the existing contractual obligations and incentives for our distribution partner to continue to grow the Omnipod user base over the next year and transition the business to us. We appreciate the execution challenge we have before us to move to direct control of our European business. We have accelerated the work and investments already underway to ensure we are fully prepared to assume complete control of the Omnipod franchise as of July 1 next year. We are confident in our team's ability to secure and optimize our European business in the near-term and to deliver exciting international market expansion over the longer-term. In Europe, based on the difference between our distributor pricing and average customer pricing, this change in business model is quickly accretive, delivers operating leverage, expands gross margins, and allows us to control our international business, which we see as a strategic imperative. This is an extraordinarily exciting opportunity to drive value for Insulet, for our shareholders and, most importantly, for our growing global diabetes community. In closing, I am incredibly proud of the Insulet team. Our team has diligently identified, developed, and implemented plans to improve our key performance indicators and build our long-term growth prospects. It is incredibly rewarding to see these plans take shape and make such an impact in the marketplace. We are passionately committed to driving incredible results today and preparing for further accelerated growth tomorrow. Now, I'll turn the call back to Pat. Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: Shacey, thank you very much. Operator, let's open the call up for questions. Operator : And our first question comes from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Your line is now open. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. I appreciate the extra color at the front-end here. That was helpful. In terms of as we look at maybe the next couple years for the European markets, can you give us any more detail in terms of France, how important is France towards growth and maybe as a percent of the installed base? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. Margaret, this is Shacey. France is approximately a third of our installed base. And it is an important example of really the risk mitigation in this transition of the business because, as I mentioned, the (31:06) stands between the manufacturer and the patients. And so, it's a fairly straightforward market to transition. It's been an incredible growth driver. I mean, really, France has been a phenom. And we do expect that growth to moderate in the near to medium-term. But it's been a pretty spectacular performer for us over the last quarter. And the businesses \u2013 the different markets across Europe sort of span the spectrum from the French model where there is a middleman like the (31:40) to more a U.S. type of models like the UK. But we do expect that market to continue to grow, but we are kind of penetrating at large percentages now and so the growth will moderate. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: This is Mike. I would just add that we have \u2013 as we've seen in the United States strong growth, we've seen very strong growth across the European markets and where we're direct in Canada. And so there is just a tremendous amount of adoption. So it's not a story all about France. I think the point about France is just it's a wonderful part of the story. And, again, it's a fairly easier operating model to transition to. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. I appreciate that extra color. In terms of the follow-up, can you talk anything about the U.S. growth and maybe the launch plan for Dash, any kind of specific details you could share of when you think that's going out, maybe incremental detail of patient adoption, how you roll it out into the installed base? Thanks. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. So, we had a great quarter \u2013 actually we had a great year so far in the U.S. Our pipeline is incredibly strong and that's been driven by commercial execution and direct-to-consumer marketing through digital channels. And so that's really increasing awareness and then the pull-through because of market access and the field performance has been very strong as well. And I think it's evidence that this focus on multiple daily injections and the value proposition there is really strong. And so that distinction is what's helping to fuel Omnipod's growth. As it relates to Dash, the feedback we got at ADA is that the platform will be even simpler and should strengthen our value proposition and our differentiation in that patient population. So we'll remain focused on that same user group. In terms of the rollout, we're keeping that kind of under wraps for competitive reasons. But I will say that we're going to have attractive avenues to access the system for both our existing users and new users. And we're really excited about the early feedback. And so we're going to do whatever we can to make sure it's a successful rollout and that also we can ramp quickly and supply what we think is going to be pretty great demand out there. But, I guess I have tempered those remarks by reminding everybody that our business model is a recurring revenue business model. So, it's not like this drives a bolus of revenue that you see with the capital models that exist out there. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. A couple of questions on Ypsomed. The first is on margins, the second is just on near-term business momentum. So, as we assume margins, Pat or Mike, the new target of 70% makes perfect sense to us 400 basis points to 500 basis points of improvement. But how much of that \u2013 how much was going direct a factor in the initial 65% number? Basically what I am trying to get at is, is 70% the ceiling or whether there are underlying improvements still not reflected in that 70%? And then I had a quick follow-up. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: This is Mike. So, when we had talked about 65% target, at that time, we were evaluating whether to go direct or not and so it factored in at the existing business model at that time, which was not going direct. And that's why in going direct and that adding about 400 basis points to our model, that's how we raised from the 65% target to the approaching 70% target. In our Investor Meeting in November, we laid out the key drivers of what gets us from where we are today of approaching 60% to the previous target of 65%. And a significant portion of that was associated with manufacturing and operation supply chain improvements, including the move to our highly automated U.S. manufacturing. There are also commercial opportunities that were factored in there as well. Now, with the higher targets, that's reflecting in full the opportunity that we now have with the direct business model in Europe. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. So to the extent that there is underlying manufacturing opportunities that got you to 65% or conservative, there could be upside of the 70% number, as 70% just reflects Ypsomed, nothing else? Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: The way I would answer that is we have consistently set targets, not that we would be satisfied with any of our targets, but the targets need to be credible. So we have direct line-of-sight, as Pat said in the past and I have, to these targets. Is there upside to the target? There is always upside. We would say that our targets though are realistic. In that, look, there is downside risk too. So, we will not stop in driving the value of this business and we're very pleased with the progress we've made today. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then \u2013 thanks, Mike. And then, Pat or Shacey, Ypsomed is obviously a best case outcome and I appreciate your comments on how you'll manage disruption near-term. If you think about the back half of 2017, the ex-U.S. guidance sort of embeds some slower momentum. Do you think that captures the risk here and how should we think about \u2013 if there is going to be disruption, how we should weigh sort of first half 2018 versus second half 2017? Thanks so much. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. Yeah. David, I think, our guidance is appropriately conservative given the transition negotiations and the pending change. So I do think it factors in that risk, but there is a clear line-of-sight to the upper end of the guidance because our interest with our distributor are somewhat aligned. So they make profit on pods. They are contractually obligated to continue to grow Omnipod between now and the expiration of the agreement. As Mike mentioned, they have a per pod fee following the 12 months after expiration of the agreement. And then they also have reputational risk if they don't continue to support Omnipod in the market. So, all of those things we believe help us mitigate risk. And I think the thing to remember is this really is short-term noise. This is a great move for us. It unlocks our international business opportunities both in Europe and beyond over the medium and long-term and just drives incredible value for us. So, yes, the guidance factors in that risk and I think we're ready to execute and pull that business over in 2018. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks so much. Operator : And our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy from Leerink Partners. Your line is now open. Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on a really great quarter. Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: Thanks, Danielle. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Thank you. Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC : So, just a quick question on the U.S. Omnipod numbers in Q2. Shacey, you mentioned that the installed base in the U.S. was up 15%, as expected, but U.S. revenue beat by nearly $1 million at the top end of the guidance range. So, just wondering if you could talk about what's driving that outperformance there, if the installed base is growing as you'd expect. Is that utilization or pricing? What's going on there? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. It's just channel mix distributor versus direct. Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Got it. And then my next question is on \u2013 well, I guess, following up on that is whatever that mix is, is that sustainable or is it just pretty volatile quarter-to-quarter? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: I think it's puts and takes. Some of it is sustainable and some of it will just naturally fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Understood. And then my next question was, at ADA, there was a lot of excitement, at least I thought, around well, of course, Dash, but also pumps for type 2 patients. And I was wondering if you could give an update on when \u2013 timing for your type 2 products and how we should think about the ramp when those products do come to market. And does the business change at all your go-to-market strategy for type 2 patients? Is it going to be significantly different than for type 1 patients? Thanks so much. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. Thanks, Danielle. That's a great question. For our type 2 product, the limitation in serving the type 2 market is really about the reservoir size. If we want to keep the form factor that everybody loves with Omnipod, we have to figure out a way to serve people who need higher volumes of insulin on a daily basis for type 2 patients, who typically require anywhere from two times to five times more insulin on a daily basis than a type 1 patient. And so we do that with the concentrated insulins program. As I mentioned, the timing for those \u2013 U500 will hit the market in 2019 and U200 will hit the market in 2020. U500 is for very highly insulin-resistant patients and so a smaller niche, although we will be the only pump approved for U500. And so it's very likely we'll take a big portion of that population. And then U200 is really the molecule that unlocks the type 2 market for us. And when we think about the type 2 market, we think about insulin-dependent type 2s. And so if you take that volume, that's approximately two times to three times the size of the market \u2013 sorry, of our market today \u2013 sorry, it doubles or potentially triples the market that we have today with type 1. So we would see acceleration there, but our data demonstrates that most people who use or who are insulin-dependent type 2s are seen by an endocrinologist. So it doesn't really mean that we have to expand our channel, but we will have messaging. We will have a product that is uniquely developed for a patient with type 2 diabetes versus the type 1. Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC : Thanks so much. Operator : And our next question comes from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you and congratulations as well on the quarter, obviously amazing performance. And let me \u2013 I want to circle back on Ypsomed and thanks for all the different commentaries. It was helpful. I do want to understand kind of beyond the fact that they're going to get paid on the next 12 month revenues post the transition, kind of, what is the obligation for them to continue to add new patients? I think their commentary on their own call suggested that the incremental adds from here will be relatively limited. Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: Mike, I think, the answer is that the contract doesn't expire until June 30 of 2018. And both parties are contractually bound with certain obligations. And one of their obligations is to actively promote the Omnipod System throughout Europe. And so I think with that \u2013 plus the fact that they have a financial incentive because they get profit on every Omnipod that they sell between now and then as well as this termination fee that's provided for and the reputational risk. I have full faith that they will live up to the obligations of the agreement. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And so that doesn't include \u2013 that does include the continued investment in adding new patients to the installed base? Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: Correct. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then I just want to go back to some of the math that you shared. If I took the commentary about European pricing being on average over (43:43) 20% discount to the U.S. and then your commentary about the implied 50% plus increase in realized pricing in going from distributor to direct, the math works out to a realized price today to Ypsomed of just under $15. Is that correct and if so does that imply a gross margin on that business of about 30% today? Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: Hi, Mike. It's Mike. In answer to your question, so we have not had a practice of confirming pricing specifically, but we did give more color here specifically, so that you could get comfortable with the modeling. So, I think, it's fair to say that it is still a discount off U.S. pricing, but it's a sizable increase off of our current pricing to Ypsomed. In terms of the gross margin improvement, I think, the important way to think through that is just what we said. In that, it improves total company gross margin by 400 basis points on a full year basis, half that for 2018 as you would expect since the agreement ends mid-year. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. One last one to clarify, Mike. I think you said $45 million to $50 million incremental OpEx. Do you expect to \u2013 when do you expect that to layer into the P&L? Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: So I did want to give \u2013 since this is a change in business model, I did want to give a view of a run rate \u2013 an annual run rate for the European business. And I did say $45 million to $50 million. That's correct. It is important to note that we are standing up this business. We've been doing a tremendous amount of work over the last couple years to prepare for this. And there is spending in 2017 associated with standing it up, but there will also be, we expect, approximately $10 million of standup cost that are non-recurring. And then there is also this fee to Ypsomed to essentially buy the book of business that's paid based on the number of customers that transition to our product. The $45 million to $50 million was really once we're running the business direct, what does the run rate look like, because it is a change from our historic business model. In terms of how it ramps up next year, we'll give more clarity as we always do when we give 2018 guidance in February as part of our year-end results. But I think it's fair to expect that the cost will ramp up through the year because we're growing the business and establishing that infrastructure over time. [Technical Difficulty] (46:28) highly confident of the seamless transition mid-year. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So what is that $45 million to $50 million number, just to understand what you're saying? Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: That's the run rate operating expenses of go direct business in Europe. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : We expect to be come second half of... Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: I'm sorry, Mike. Could you repeat that? Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: Okay. Mike, we lost you. Let's go to the... Operator : And our next question comes from Tao Levy from Wedbush. Your line is now open. Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. Just maybe one clarification and I'll have two questions. Is my math correct that we're talking about the current run rate business from the end user side of things for Ypsomed being around $140-ish million plus whatever the PDMs sell for over there? Is that in the ballpark? Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: Tao, this is Mike. I just want to make sure I'm understanding your question correctly because we gave guidance for the year for our international... Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: I'm sorry, when you take over the account. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: Oh, I'm sorry. Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Yeah, truing up, what would that book of business look like under... Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. Well, I think, what we've been saying is that the business is growing very nicely from a volume standpoint. From a pricing standpoint, we expect the pricing to improve mid-year by approximately 50% from our historic pricing. And so with our guidance that we've already provided of $105 million to $108 million for international, obviously, not all of that is Europe. It's roughly 80% or so. But that's the basis for doing estimates of 2018 run rate. And, again, we'll give more clarity specifically on 2018 when we do our year-end call. Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. And just also to be clear, following up on what Mike had asked. My German is not great, but I thought the Ypsomed had said they were going to end the next year at around 65,000 installed base and kind of grow it at that 30%. Is that correct or did they say that it wasn't going to grow? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: They did indicate on their call that their business would continue to grow. The number that I provided, Tao, was the approximate patients that exist today. So, that's 50,000. And I don't recall the exact number, but I think it was north of 60,000 that they indicated on their call. And my German isn't great. Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Robert Baird. Your line is now open. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Mike, maybe just following up, I think, what an earlier caller, Mike, was getting at on the SG&A, the $45 million to $50 million. I just want to understand your comments there. Is that $45 million to $50 million incremental to the cost you're putting in right now into that business to try to make the transition smooth in the international market? Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: Let me be crystal clear. So, as a direct business in Europe, we expect the annual run rate operating expenses to support that on a direct basis to be $45 million to $50 million. That is the annual run rate when we are direct in Europe. Up until that time, we are ramping up the team. We have a clear plan, cross-functionally. And so, the cost will be ramping up to that, but that will be the run rate once we assume direct distribution on an annual basis mid-year. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. So, we don't have to step up that full $45 million to $50 million come the transition period? Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: I think what's important to understand though is there will be stand up expenses in 2018, but we have to hire all the people. And the full run rate spending, once we are fully operational, is $45 million to $50 million. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Understood. And then on the inventory side, I would assume Ypsomed is holding at least one month or two months of inventory, maybe a little bit more. Will that net out against your first half revenues or in other words will they start drawing into their inventory base as we get into the last month or two months of their contract, that we need to account for that in our revenue estimates for you? Or will there just be some sort of return at the mid-year that we'd kind of one-off out of the model at that point? Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: Jeff, this is Mike. I would not presume that inventory has a meaningful impact on your models. We have been managing, as we've been saying for quite some time now, managing to make sure that there is not a lot of inventory in the channel. With all of the improvements that we have made in manufacturing and supply chain, there really is no need for it. And so, I would not expect that inventory will have a meaningful impact on your models. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then if I could squeeze in a follow-up here. Just when I think of some of the Omnipod Horizon trials and progress you've made so far, starting the third IDE \u2013 Shacey, maybe this is a question for you. On the first two, you've already gone through pediatrics and adult exercise postprandial, some of those things. I've only covered the space for I don't know two years or three years at this point, but you've made a lot of progress in a short while here in six months or nine months. Is there something about Omnipod? Is it the simplicity of it, the safety of it? Is the FDA just getting more comfortable with some of these trials? But what has enabled you or the Horizon system to move so quickly through some of these different IDEs relative to maybe at least what I feel like some of your competitors have done over the last five years? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Well, I think, the primary thing is the team that is working on the development program. We have a world-class Medical Director in Trang Ly, who has been involved in every single APE clinical program prior to coming to Insulet. She knows what great looks like and she knows how to avoid some of the pitfalls that other programs ran into. We have an extraordinary research and development team, particularly the software and chip (53:05) team and mobile technology team in San Diego and the pod \u2013 I can't even single them out. They're working very, very well together, the device team, the software team to make rapid iteration and progress on the innovation front. And then you highlighted it. The FDA has been very supportive. I would describe our relationship with them as collaborative. We're getting the guidance that we need. And we feel like we've got a very tight clinical plan that we're executing on. So, I would agree I get so excited when I think about the progress the team has made in such a short period of time and even more excited when I think about the product that we're going to launch and the differentiation that we'll bring to market, so. Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: Go ahead, operator. Operator : And our next question comes from Raj Denhoy from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Good afternoon. I wonder if I could ask a product development question. One of the things on Horizon that has kind of stood out as the fact that you're using a receiver on Android device that's kind of locked down, right, and there has been some talk about whether you could open that up and maybe have a connected device as the ultimate receiver and maybe the FDA is getting more willing to do that. Is there any updates on that front? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: And by connected device, do you mean mobile phone? Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC : Exactly, right. So, it would add some cellular connectivity to it. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. So, we continue to be in great, I think, active discussions with the FDA regarding that. And that's certainly our hope, if that we could get to phone control maybe even before Horizon. I think the FDA recognizes and now has set up panels of experts to work on cybersecurity for mobile devices and moving to phone control for medical devices. And we're actively engaged in those discussions and those panels. And so we're working very hard on behalf of our customer base to get to that \u2013 to phone control because we know it's what they want and we'd like to be leaders in that area. Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And obviously it adds this question, but 670G, right. So there has been an automated insulin delivery device out there, a little bit limited in its launch, but clearly you're not seeing your numbers, but I am curious whether there is anything it offer in terms of feedback from marketplace or whether you think you're through kind of the worst of people's worry around that, if there's any update on that front would be helpful. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: I think we've heard what you've heard. There have been some bumps in the launch. And we are hearing from endos that they are becoming more familiar with just how much time and work it's going to take to \u2013 and that they are going to need to devote to support and train people on these more complex systems. And I think that's just highlighting the difference in our value proposition around simplicity and ease of use. And I think it supports our messaging that there may be some reason to use a device like 670 on a patient, who is wearing a tube pump and is willing to put in the work to get whatever incremental benefit they are going to out of that technology. That's not our patient population. Our targeted demographic is the multiple daily injection user. And for those people, we can help bring them to pod therapy and better glycemic control, better quality of life that they would not have gotten because they weren't willing to get onto to a tube pump. So I think it just highlights really the segmentation in the market and that we're a different value proposition and a different patient target. Operator : And our next question comes from Doug Schenkel from Cowen. Your line is now open. Ryan Blicker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. This is Ryan in for Doug. Thanks for taking my questions. You noted the installed base growth of 15% in the U.S. year-over-year and that your pipeline is as strong as it's ever been. Based on my math, it seems U.S. new patient starts approximated mid-to-high teens year-over-year growth in Q2 and maybe even 20% plus. Am I in the right neighborhood? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: We're purposely not giving that detail any longer because it's misleading in terms of its connection to revenue growth and that just goes back to our business model. But really the best predictor of revenue growth is installed base because you have to take into consideration that that's 90% plus of what drives our revenue in a quarter and attrition also drives or retention rather also drives revenue. And so, I would just focus on the fact that we grew our installed base 15% in the United States the last quarter. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: What I would \u2013 this is Mike. I would just say. I mean we have seen increasing momentum quarter-by-quarter and are very pleased with the growth in new patients. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Thanks, Mike. Ryan Blicker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Understood. And then maybe just one follow-up on Drug Delivery. I believe at your Investor Day last November, you talked about Amgen wanting to launch the Onpro kit internationally. We haven't heard much about that since then. Can you \u2013 anything you can provide there? Is it something that's possible for 2018? Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: That's really a question for Amgen. Operator? Operator : And our next question comes from Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. Your line is now open. Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good afternoon and congratulations on the performance. So, just a couple quickies and I apologize if I missed this. But on the payout to Ypsomed, the fee, is it paid on total European installed base at the time of the switchover? Is it just on the folks that they add over the next year? Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: Jayson, this is Mike. So the fee is calculated based upon the number of pods that are sold in the 12 months after the contract expires, which is June 30, 2018, to people who had previously purchased Omnipod devices from Ypsomed. So, it's based on the number of pods sold. So, as such, they have every incentive to continue to drive the number of patients on that device through June 30 of 2018 and that fee is maximized based upon there being very limited attrition of those patients in the 12 months following the contract expiration. So, from our perspective, we think it's a very helpful fee, because it aligns our interest in really making sure that the patients are taking care of, that we continue to grow Omnipod in Europe and that there is a successful transition of the business. Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. That's very helpful. Just as a follow-up to \u2013 does going direct in Europe change your international revenue goals for 2021 that you laid out at the Analyst Day? Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: This is Mike again. So the goals that we laid out at the Analyst Day of $1 billion in revenue, driven by growth across all of our product lines with strong growth, 20% CAGR, across our product lines has not changed at all. As we said at the time, the focus is on growing the business. We don't need any one product or area to have outsized impact. It was never meant to be. Here is exactly the growth that we're going to have in U.S. versus international versus Drug Delivery which really meant to say we have so many opportunities across this book of business. That's why we're confident in the $1 billion target. Operator : And our last question comes from Suraj Kalia from Northland Securities. Your line is now open. Suraj Kalia - Northland Securities, Inc.: Good afternoon, everyone. Congrats on a great quarter. So, Pat and Shacey, let me piggyback on some of the Ypsomed related questions. I know you all have provided a lot of information. We do appreciate it. Ypsomed has a pretty significant outreach effort and they have indicated 30% plus growth with their footprint. How do you all see the correlation \u2013 and forgive me if I missed this \u2013 between feet on the ground, the geographic disparity, the relative price elasticity? I know you all have given $40 million to $50 million incremental OpEx on a normalized basis or a steady state condition. I'm more curious if you can give us one additional layer of color. What does this mean in terms of how you all target geographies, people, so on and so forth? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Well, I will just remind you that the business is actually fairly concentrated. And so that's one factor when you think about what our investment and what the size of our team needs to look like. And then the other thing I'll say is that Ypsomed had a large portfolio of commodity devices in addition to Omnipod and so they weren't 100% focused on Omnipod and, obviously, recently launched their competitive device. So I think we're expecting once this team is fully \u2013 the sales team is fully productive that we will get benefit from the sole focus on Omnipod and our growing product portfolio. And that may mean that our team needs to look different. And then when you look across the continent and even among our four largest markets, their business models are very different. So, you may have a different type of commercial presence depending on the market that you're serving. I talked about France in my opening remarks. Our commercial organization in a country like France is going to look very different than our commercial organization, for example, in the United Kingdom or Germany. But we will make and we are \u2013 we plan to make \u2013 we are making the right level of investment to make sure that we best serve that marketplace and all of the important customers to us in Europe. Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: And just from another perspective. As Shacey mentioned, we're currently in 13 markets in Europe, concentrated in four. If you take an individual country in Europe, it's about the size of our Canadian operation. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: That's correct. Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: So, it's a series of countries that are about the size of our business in Canada. So, we have every confidence we're going to be able to do this very effectively during the transition period. Suraj Kalia - Northland Securities, Inc.: Fair enough. And last question from my side, Pat or Shacey again. Can you give us some color on the differences or the relative utilization rates between U.S. patients and European patients? Here's the reason why I ask. We can do the math from the number of patients. We can reverse engineer the ASPs, what potentially you guys are going to charge. And, obviously, the key element here is knowing how many pods per month per patient will be used. And what I am trying to really get at is even if we don't increase the number of patients, let's assume that happens after you all separate, if nothing even else happens, this is the step-up in revenues just based on this direct transition. So I am trying to get to the bottom of that. Any color on the utilization between these geographies would be great. Thank you for taking my questions. Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: In terms of utilization per patient, we're really not in a position to give you that information. I think you can run your models and come up with reasonable estimates. What I would say about the European market is that in terms of pump penetration, Europe is only about 20% penetrated in pumps versus 30% in the United States. And so, we think there is great opportunities to expand the market in Europe through a higher penetration. And, secondly the attrition rate is about 9% in the U.S. and it's only about 2% to 3% in Europe. So, once a patient gets on a product in Europe, they'll start the reimbursement for life, which is vastly different than the every 18 month people transition during \u2013 in the United States transition between insurance plans. Operator : Thank you. And at this time, I would now like to turn the conference back to Patrick Sullivan. Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: Great. Thank you, operator. We are absolutely positively thrilled to establish a direct presence in Europe. We've done our homework and we're very prepared and we're ready for the challenge. We have the right team in place to drive significant performance and success. And we have the right tools in place to win and achieve our goal of $1 billion in revenue in 2021. I'd like to thank the Insulet employees for their hard work and dedication to ease the burden and improve the lives of people living with diabetes and other diseases. Thank you for joining us on the call today. We look forward to sharing our progress during the course of what is shaping up to be a very exciting 2017. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

Steven Lichtman - Oppenheimer Operator : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Insulet Corporation Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Deborah R. Gordon - Insulet Corp.: Thank you, Kevin. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2017 earnings call. Joining me today are Patrick Sullivan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Shacey Petrovic, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Michael Levitz, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The replay of this call will be archived on our website, and our press release discussing our third quarter 2017 results and fourth quarter and full-year guidance is also available in the IR section of our website. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to be materially different from any future results implied by such statements. Such factors include those referenced in our Safe Harbor statement, in our third quarter earnings release, and in the company's filings with the SEC. With that, I'll turn the call over to Pat. Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: Thank you, Deb. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us in the call today. I'll begin with a brief review of our third quarter performance and the progress we're making on our three key initiatives. Specifically, number one, completing product development on Dash, our next-generation Omnipod technology platform; number two, transitioning to direct distribution in Europe; and three, establishing our U.S. manufacturing operations. Mike will provide more detail on our third quarter financial results and on our guidance for Q4 and full-year 2017, Shacey will then provide comments on our commercial and R&D progress, we'll then open the call up for questions. I'd like to first recognize that November is National Diabetes Awareness Month. We are very proud of what we do every day to simplify life for people with diabetes. The Omnipod provides simple and elegant technology that reduces the burden of managing the disease, improves quality of life, and delivers better health outcomes for patients. Next Monday, we will take part in the Closing Bell ceremony at NASDAQ to increase diabetes awareness. For the third quarter, every area of our business delivered outstanding performance. Total revenue for the third quarter was $122 million, a year-over-year revenue growth of 28% and $8 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. U.S. Omnipod revenue was $70 million, up 17% year-over-year, International revenue was $32.5 million, up 70% year-over-year, and Drug Delivery was $19 million, up 19% year-over-year. Our gross margin was 60.5%, an improvement of 180 basis points from our Q3 of last year, and we remain completely confident in our ability to drive gross margin towards 70% in 2021. As a result of our better than expected performance and our positive outlook for the remainder of this year, we're raising full-year revenue guidance to a range of $456 million to $459 million, a $13 million increase from the midpoint of our previous guidance, and 25% year-over-year growth. During the quarter, we made significant progress on the development of our Omnipod Dash system. Dash is the technology platform for all of our future innovations, including our concentrated insulin programs with Eli Lilly and the Horizon Automated Glucose Control System. Shacey will provide you more commentary on Dash. We continue to drive sustained outstanding improvements on the manufacturing and supply chain, which are positively impacting our gross margin and product quality. Since 2015, the operations team, working closely with our contract manufacturer, has doubled the pod production per day. And now our daily pod production is at an all-time high, ensuring we continue to meet our customers' needs as our installed base continues to grow. Over just the past three years, the ops team has delivered a greater than 75% reduction in scrap, and is focused on providing the highest quality products to every customer, every time, all the time. We are on schedule to establish our new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Massachusetts. We held a groundbreaking ceremony several weeks ago with over 400 attendees, including Massachusetts Governor, Charlie Baker, as the keynote speaker. This new facility will provide increased capacity, and importantly, second source redundancy to our current contract manufacturer, all part of our supply chain risk mitigation strategy. We are building a world-class manufacturing facility that will set a new standard in the industry. The first highly automated line is scheduled to be placed in service in the early 2019. We recently announced our decision to transition to direct distribution of the Omnipod system in Europe beginning July 1, 2018. Selling direct rather than through a distributor allows us to be closer to our customer and maintain control over our existing and future markets. This transition will result in international market input for our product development pipeline and a significant improvement in revenue and gross margins. We're excited about this opportunity and have full steam ahead in establishing our European operations. We're pleased with the progress we've made, and we remain confident in our ability to successfully transition the business by the middle of next year. We are well on our way to achieve our 2021 targets of $1 billion in revenue, gross margin approaching 70%, and above market profitability. We are pleased with our accomplishments to date, are excited for the opportunities to continue our strong growth trajectory, and we remain focused on creating shareholder \u2013 value for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike. Mike? Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: Thank you, Pat. I will review our third quarter results and then discuss our fourth quarter and full-year 2017 guidance. As I review our results, unless otherwise stated, all commentary regarding changes will be on a year-over-year basis. We are very pleased to report third quarter revenue growth of 28%, with revenue of $121.8 million, compared to $94.9 million. All three of our product lines contributed meaningfully to this growth. We exceeded the midpoint of our stated guidance by $8 million, with the majority of the beat coming from International Omnipod, on strong momentum across our European markets, including continued strong growth in newer markets such as France. The remainder of the beat in the third quarter was led by the U.S. Omnipod, also on continued strong momentum. Our gross margin increased over 180 basis points to 60.5%, primarily from improvements we've made over the last year to our manufacturing and supply chain operations, as well as improvements to product quality, offset in part by unfavorable mix due to higher international distributor sales. We are very pleased to reach above 60% for the first time at Insulet, which is a direct result of the team's tremendous execution in driving both quality and efficiency. Our operating expenses increased to $71.6 million, compared to $53.2 million. This increase in spending reflects head count that we've added over the last year to support the growth in our business, such as increased investment in product innovation and our commercial and operational infrastructure. This increase also includes investment to support our assumption in mid-2018 of direct commercial support for Omnipod in Europe, and is consistent with our previously stated plans. We ended the quarter with over $275 million in cash and investment, compared to approximately $300 million at the end of last year. The decrease from last year is a result of our capital expenditures, primarily associated with investments in our U.S. manufacturing project and other investments in global supply chain and contract manufacturing operation to supply the significant growth of our business. Our cash and investments also reflect continued strong days sales outstanding, as well as stable inventory levels even with the growth of our business. We are in a strong financial position, as we continue to make strategic investments in support of our near and longer-term organic growth opportunities. I will now update you on our 2017 outlook. For the full year, given our better than expected revenue to date and strong momentum across the business, we are raising our revenue outlook to be in the range of $456 million to $459 million, up on both the low and high-end from our previous range of $440 million to $450 million. The $13 million raise at the midpoint is largely associated with exceptional Omnipod demand in international markets and continued strong demand in the U.S. market. The revised guidance compares to 2016 revenue of $367 million, and now represents growth of 25% at the midpoint. At a product line level, we expect full year U.S. Omnipod revenue in the range of $267 million to $269 million, representing growth of 17% at the midpoint. We expect International Omnipod in the range of $117 million to $118 million, representing growth of 64% at the midpoint. And we expect Drug Delivery to be approximately $72.5 million, in line with our previously stated revenue range and representing growth of 11%. For the fourth quarter of 2017, we expect revenue in the range of $123 million to $126 million, compared to $103.6 million and representing growth of 20% at the midpoint. At a product line level, we expect fourth quarter U.S. Omnipod revenue in the range of $71.5 million to $73.5 million and representing growth of 15% at the midpoint. We expect International Omnipod in the range of $33 million to $34 million, representing growth of 61% at the midpoint, and we expect Drug Delivery to be approximately $18.5 million. This represents a decline of 6% due to some timing between Q3 and Q4, however, again, on a full-year basis, we continue to expect Drug Delivery revenue to be in line with our previously stated guidance. On gross margin, we are reaffirming our expectation to 2017, full-year gross margin will approach 60%, up significantly compared to our reported 57.5% last year. This reflects the substantial operational improvements we've made, partially offset by the unfavorable mix from faster growing international distributor revenue. We are pleased with the tremendous progress we have made in margin expansion, and we are very confident of reaching our longer-term goal of approaching 70% gross margin. To achieve our revenue growth and profitability goals, we will continue to invest in our business, including commercial, research and development, and infrastructure investment. We expect full-year 2017 operating expenses to increase between 26% and 28% from 2016, which includes initial spending to expand our European infrastructure, and is in line with our previous guidance. As Pat mentioned, our plans to assume direct commercial responsibility over our European Omnipod operations are on track, and represent a tremendous opportunity to drive continued expansion of both revenue and profitability. We continue to expect the transition to a direct business in Europe will drive a material increase in our revenue run rate in the second half of 2018, driven by European end user pricing, which while on average is lower than pricing in the U.S., is approximately 50% higher than our historic distributor pricing. We also expect this to drive an increase in total company gross margin by approximately 400 basis points on a full-year basis, with half of that expected for calendar year 2018, assuming the midyear transition. Lastly, on the strength of our growing business, continued operational improvements, and our exciting innovation strategy, we remain on track to deliver sustainably positive EBIT beginning next year and driving to above-market profitability over the coming years in line with our stated goals and objectives. I will now turn the call over to Shacey. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Thanks, Mike. Third quarter results were once again terrific, with strong momentum heading into the fourth quarter. Our commercial strategies continue to drive robust revenue growth and an increase in our global installed base. The progress we've made with our innovation pipeline is exciting, and I'll share more about that in a moment. And as Pat noted, our manufacturing and operational strategies continue to drive improvements in product quality, across-the-board efficiencies, and expansion of our margins. As a reminder, because of Omnipod's recurring revenue model, installed base growth is the best predictor of revenue growth. And installed base is an estimate because about half of our U.S. customer base and the majority of our international customer base goes through third-party distributors. In Q3, we grew our U.S. installed base approximately 15% year-over-year as expected, and we grew our international installed base more than 60%, exceeding our expectations. Combined, this represents year-over-year growth in our global installed base of approximately 30% as of the end of the third quarter, which drove our strong company revenue growth. As a result of the tremendous growth we're experiencing internationally, we now anticipate growing our worldwide installed base approximately 30% for the full year, up from our prior year-over-year expectation of 25%. We are reaffirming expected growth of 15% in our U.S. installed base, and we are raising our estimate of the international installed base growth to approaching 60% from our prior assumption of 40%. Our U.S. revenue growth continues to be fueled by increasing the footprint of our field sales team, marketing efforts to raise awareness, and our drive to broaden market access. These will be areas in which we continue to invest because they are clearly paying off. We are improving brand awareness, increasing advocacy and utilization among physicians, and because of Omnipod's low upfront cost and product advantages, we are expanding Medicaid access. Bolstering our efforts is the strong and growing body of clinical evidence supporting the many benefits of Omnipod. At the recent European Association for the Study of Diabetes conference, we shared real-world Omnipod user data from almost 39,000 U.S. patients, who also used our data management system Insulet Provided Glooko. The takeaway was clear, Omnipod patients do better than the national average, with an estimated A1c for Podders of 8.1%. This insight could be particularly helpful for payers who include A1c as an important performance measure. We now have more than 50,000 Omnipod customers, well over half of our U.S. installed base, using Insulet Provided Glooko. This enables incredibly rich, large population, real-world data sets to demonstrate the value of Omnipod to payers, clinicians, and to end users. At the same time, we continue to make notable progress on our innovation roadmap, particularly with our Omnipod Dash system. Dash is designed to provide users with an unparalleled ease of use through mobile technology, while the most visible change is the sleek, compact, touchscreen Dash PDM. The most notable change is in what you can't see, the Bluetooth connectivity. This connectivity liberates the data in our PDM and pod to provide all of our Dash customers with unique meaningful benefits. For the payer, this means access to aggregate diabetes and outcomes data on their specific membership populations through their Omnipod Dashboards. For the clinician, this means less time training patients on pump therapy and immediate access to their diabetes data for streamlined office workflow and improved interactions with their patients. And for the patients, this means insulin delivery control at their fingertips, easy access to their pod therapy information on their PDMs or on their mobile phone, and the ability to share their diabetes data with caregivers via our Dash View mobile app. Their Omnipod PDM data will be an app on their phones right where they view their CGM data or their health and fitness data. We are very pleased to report that we have successfully completed our summative (18:17) human factor studies for Dash, and based on early feedback, we are confident our customers will love this new product platform, which will transform the way they manage their diabetes. We are on track to submit our 510(k) to the FDA around the end of this year and anticipate a limited market launch mid next year. This marks a very important milestone for Insulet, since Dash is the platform for our future product innovations, including concentrated insulins and our Horizon Automated Glucose Control System. We continue to make great progress on our Omnipod Horizon development program. We now have 118 patients including pediatrics, adolescents, and adults monitored with our Horizon algorithm. We are currently underway with our third IDE, which is taking place under normal living conditions, in a hotel setting with the patients spending a longer time in our hybrid closed-loop phase. The study results continue to demonstrate that our Horizon algorithm performs very well, and is safe during the day and night across all age groups. Turning to our International business, we have made substantial progress expanding our European infrastructure. We are building a strong foundation for a successful transition of our Omnipod business on July 1 of next year. We are rapidly hiring high caliber talent in Europe to ensure we have the bench strength and expertise to deliver international market expansion over the near and longer term. This past quarter, we focused on key functions such as commercial, IT, quality, and regulatory affairs. We will be ready to assume full control of the business and deliver continuity of care for every Omnipod user and clinician in Europe. In the meantime, we are experiencing rapid growth in our international installed base, with our largest markets including Canada, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, all contributing to the outstanding installed base growth. Remarkably, we launched in France just one year ago or just about a year ago, and it remains a significant contributor to our international growth, representing about a third of our total European installed base. This change to a direct business model allows us to control our International business, which we see as a strategic imperative, because it will give us better insights to the market needs and ensure that we deliver innovation that supports and best meets those needs. In the near term, based on the difference between our distributor pricing and average customer pricing in Europe, it expands margins and is quickly accretive. And in the longer term, this move means we can accelerate our international expansion and new market entries. This is an exciting opportunity to drive value for Insulet, for our shareholders, and importantly, for our growing global customer base. Lastly, results of our Drug Delivery business remain strong supported by the market's continued adoption of Amgen's Neulasta Onpro kit, which reached 56% of all U.S. Neulasta doses at the end of the third quarter. We remain excited about our partnership with Amgen. And more generally, we remain excited about our prospects of working with pharmaceutical partners for the delivery of other non-insulin therapies that can benefit from the comfort and convenience of our pod. We continue to believe Drug Delivery represents an attractive opportunity for long-term growth. In closing, I am incredibly proud of what our team has accomplished in a relatively short period of time. We have driven improved performance across the board and established a strong foundation for long-term growth and success. With that, I'll turn the call back to Pat. Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: Shacey, thank you very much. Operator, now, let's open the call up for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good afternoon and congratulations on another great quarter. Pat and team, I know it's early, but I thought maybe we could talk a little about your 2018 qualitatively only because this year, there are two, I think, very big things that could impact next year's numbers, one being the Animas customer program that you've announced, as well as these ex-U.S. go direct dynamics. Can you just talk qualitatively about what those two dynamics could mean for next year in terms of relative growth rates? I mean, should investors expect similar sustained growth into 2018? Could we expect acceleration in these markets given those two kind of exogenous events? Then I got a quick follow-up. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. I'll start maybe by addressing the question regarding Animas. We do have a program in place to help educate Animas users that they have options and can transition to Omnipod, and in fact, we've been working with Dexcom, it's been fun to kind of get that out there and get the word out. But just two things to keep in mind, David, is it's not our target segment. So still this quarter, like every quarter, 80% or more of our new customers are coming from MDI. And I don't really anticipate that that's going to change dramatically next quarter or beyond. And the other thing is just a reminder because of the recurring revenue model, any impact that that might have is going to be kind of over time as opposed to in a particular given quarter or even year. I wouldn't anticipate that because it's not our target segment. I'll make one other comment on Ypsomed, just because you mentioned that, I think that transition is going very well. And we feel like we're on track with everything that we obviously just guided to for the end of the year, but I don't think we're ready to give kind of any substantive guidance for 2018. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: The only thing I would add to that, and this is Mike, is just as I said and as we said last quarter, we do expect that the go-direct strategy is going to have a material impact on our run rate for the consolidated business because of the change in business model. And so, in the middle of the year, when we go direct in the second half of 2018, we do expect a significant appreciation in revenue because even though the European pricing is lower than the U.S. pricing on average, because our historic run rate is with our \u2013 is based upon our historic distributor pricing, the end user pricing will be a 50% \u2013 approximately 50% uplift from that. And so that will result in a significant increase even beyond all the volume increase that we've been describing over the last few years here. And a corresponding impact of the revenue growth will be a significant increase in gross margin, we talked about 400 basis points increase from the change in business model on a full-year basis, and so assuming a midyear impact of 200 basis points. For both of those, we expect would drive a change in the business model, but hopefully, we've given you enough to be able to model that effectively. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: It's very helpful, Mike. And then Shacey, just my quick follow-up here. Just thinking about the quarter, U.S. was strong, but the ex-U.S. number was obviously much better than expected. Just give us a little sense relative to your expectations, what changed here into the back half of the year, I mean, how much of this is the sustainability of the traction in France, and perhaps how much of this is less disruption potentially than you expected with the transition or early part of the transition, or how much of this is other markets that are unrelated to France? Thanks so much. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. I think I would say, it's those first two that you mentioned. Really, the transition has been going smoothly. And so we have less disruption than we anticipated. And we have continued strong growth across the continent, and in particular, still in France. So both of those things are driving kind of the uptick in the guidance for the rest of the year. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: And this is Mike again, I'll just add on to that. We did indicate, since our last call, was shortly after we had just announced that we were going to be going direct, that there was potentially some conservatism built into our guidance that we gave last quarter, just because of the number of unknowns related to the transition. We've been retiring that risk, and as a result, the guidance that we're giving now is less conservative. We felt it was realistic before, this is really realistic and reflects the continued growth and momentum in that business. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson with Baird. Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess two for me this afternoon as well. One, following up on David's question on Animas, I know you've been running that conversion program, but I just want to confirm maybe Shacey with you or Mike, it's probably unlikely Animas users move before they're out of warranty period, otherwise they'd have to start paying out of pocket. So I just \u2013 my guess is, we're not going to see a lot from Animas here in the extreme near term, but also on Animas, I think Dexcom had it right last night, they talked about Animas being a popular pump option with pediatric patients. We're hearing upwards of maybe 5,000 to 10,000 pediatric patients in the U.S. on an Animas pump. Does that at all match with your numbers? And why would I not expect over a couple year period all 5,000 or 10,000 of those pediatric patients to come over to Omnipod? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: I think your numbers are in the ballpark similar to ours, Jeff. And I think we would expect some of those customers to come over to Omnipod, but I would just reiterate it's not our target segment. So, in any given quarter or year, we don't get the vast majority of our customers coming from tube pumps if they're already comfortable wearing a tube pump, they're probably going to look at all of their options. Most of our customers come from MDI users. And I would agree that this is a transition that's going to happen over the next two years, as opposed to something that's going to create a big bolus in a given quarter or even a given year. Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: All right. Thanks. And then for my follow-up, I think I've asked you guys something like this before, but after seeing Abbott just win pretty broad approval for Libre with somewhat, I don't know, maybe uninspiring data, it seems like we have another example of the FDA being more and more supportive of giving new diabetes devices to the market or getting them to the market as quickly as possible. So in that context, have you guys had any conversations with the FDA about pathways in which you might be able to accelerate Horizon or get that to the market some point before 2019, especially if we have 6.70 (29:03) on the market as a predicate? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: We have regular discussions with the FDA. We've had multiple pre-submission discussions with the FDA tied to Horizon, so we're always discussing how to make our clinical and product development pathway as efficient and effective as possible. Other than that, I can't give a lot of color. But I would say that we've had the same type of support and enthusiasm for Dash as well. And they certainly have been very supportive in us getting a submission ready and in terms of helping us get to market as quickly as we can. Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Taylor with Barclays. Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, thanks for taking the question, and congrats on a good quarter. So the first question I wanted to ask was, one of your competitors or future ones talked about developing a patch pump for type 2 patients? And maybe at a lower cost launching about a year from now, I was wondering if that's also a market you think you could address, it's not one you talked directly to and whether you think that could encroach on your business at all? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure, Matt. I would say, we actually talk pretty frequently about the type 2 market, because our partnership with Eli Lilly on concentrated insulins is really designed to address that market. One of the differences between the customer needs with people who live with type 2 versus type 1 is the volume of insulin that they require. And so, in order to keep the great form factor and the small pod form factor that we have, we've partnered with Eli Lilly to concentrate the insulin and get their U100 and U500 approved out of the pod. So those program \u2013 U200 rather and U500 approved out of the pod, so those programs are underway and on track, we've made terrific progress, and I think will really help us address that customer segment very nicely. We've got other elements of that customer or that product platform that will also be very appealing. But then I would just point out that, what's really important about launching a patch pump in the United States or anywhere in the globe is about operational excellence and how well you serve the market. And that's where I think some of the advancements and progress that we've made on the manufacturing operations is such a competitive differentiator, because to really do this well and be able to manufacture high quality, high volume product at the rate that we do, that's the differentiator, and I think that is an area where we've clearly shown we can excel. Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's great perspective. And then maybe secondly, as you'd kind of forced through this international transition, it sounds like you've really put a lot of good brackets in place to be able to execute that smoothly and contractually on the Ypsomed side as well for some protection, but what are the guideposts that you would point us to or investors to look for over the next couple quarters, aside from international growth, to understand how well that's going? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Well, I think this quarter, the 60% installed base growth probably speaks for itself. The business continues to really grow rapidly while we work with Ypsomed to transition next year. We're making great progress. We've been really warmly welcomed by the clinical community in Europe. Over the last, I guess, two months really, we held symposiums and product workshops at EASD in Portugal, EASD (32:39) in Austria and at children with diabetes in the UK, so all over Europe, and our events have been standing room only and clinicians have expressed their \u2013 really their sincere support and enthusiasm about us establishing a direct presence in the market. So we're thrilled to be making that happen. I think the best indicator of how we're doing is really looking at the installed base growth. Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks and congratulations on another strong quarter. Let me just ask a couple questions. Just on France, what do you think your market share is now? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: I would guess, somewhere around 30%, 35% would be my guess. Mike, we said it before, we have less insight into Europe than we do into United States, and even so, we don't generally track market share against other pumps, we're looking at kind of the total opportunity there from a type 1 diabetes standpoint. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And I've heard your comment again that I think 80% of your patients are MDI, you've generally said 70% to 80% last couple of years. We got numbers from J&J when they announced they're exiting the business, that basically imply that their U.S. installed base has shrunk by about close to 20,000 patients since the end of 2015. You don't think you've gotten a fair amount of those patients, it would seem that those patients went somewhere, and it doesn't look like Medtronic's business necessarily benefited from it. So, I'm just kind of wondering that their installed base has declined as much as it has over the last year and a half, two years. Where had those patients gone, and are you not getting more of those patients than maybe you think? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Well, I think there's probably those patients included in the 20% or so of our patients that come from pumps. I'm just saying that the vast majority in our target segment is the 80% that come from MDI, and we \u2013 really, our strategy and what we consider ourselves and I think what is clearly evident in the numbers is that we are a category grower, not a share taker. That's not our strategy, it's not our approach. Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: And I would just add, Mike... Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. But that 80% number, where do you get that from? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: We track that, so every new patient that comes on, we get a prescription and categorize and track where they're coming from. Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: And we don't \u2013 this is Pat, we don't have visibility on the 20% that are coming from pumps, which pump they're coming from. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: That's right. We just know whether they're coming from pump therapy or MDI. Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got you. Okay. Thank you. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt O'Brien with Piper Jaffrey. Unknown Speaker : Hi. Good afternoon. This is JP (35:32) on for Matt. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask on the international strength, I know you had some incentives in place when you negotiated your agreement for the remainder of \u2013 through July. Did that go through July, or was it \u2013 did it go through the end of this year? I just want to make sure there wasn't some sort of bogey that they had to hit internationally maybe they pulled forward some sales, some clarification there? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: No. We don't want \u2013 first of all, we track their installed base, right. So that's what I reported out on, and obviously that was very strong. So even independent of their revenue and I think they were roughly in line, but no, there wasn't anything particular that they needed to achieve with this transition this quarter. Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. Because their contract goes through June 30 of next year, and so both parties contractually bound by that agreement, there were no modifications to it or anything. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: And the incentive is actually tied to the sales that happened 12 months after the termination of the agreement, so... Unknown Speaker : Okay. It's good to know. And then on the cost side of things, I know you started incurring some costs internationally. And as we all look out in our models, we'll bump up revenue and gross margins starting Q3, Q4 next year. Can you help us walk through maybe break out some of the costs you're already incurring in this quarter and next quarter to ramp, and so here (37:01) we can get on a good run rate for second half of next year? Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: Absolutely. This is Mike. So, a couple of things, we indicated last quarter in the call where we saw the operating expense run rate would go, and we also raised our operating expense expectations in 2017, and we raised it by about 5 points of growth, and we said that was to reflect the spend this year to really get things off the ground even though we've been planning for this as a contingency for quite some time, we really ramped this up this year. So, about 5 points off of last year's OpEx is roughly $10 million give or take. So I think that's what \u2013 it's fair from what we said last quarter that that would indicate for 2017. And what we talked about for 2018 is, we said $45 million to $50 million of operating expense run rate when we get into a full up and running in the middle of the year. The way that's going to work is, we are ramping up now, we will be ramping up more in the first half of next year. And so, we'll be having more of the expenses before we get the pricing and margin that comes once we go direct in the second half of the year. Unknown Speaker : And then is there any update on Medicare? Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: Sure. This is Pat. We remain very confident that we're going to secure Medicare reimbursement. From my perspective, it's just a matter of time. We have the complete support of many members of Congress, the professional and medical societies. And we remain very confident that we're going to get Medicare reimbursement. I just can't give you an exact time. Unknown Speaker : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Margaret Kaczor with William Blair. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. The first one for me is on France. And I'm curious if you guys have any sense of the rate of change and market penetration of comps in general that you've seen since you entered. And how many of those patients that you've seen in France are coming from MDI? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: That's a great question, Margaret. Unfortunately, I mean, this is exactly one of the reasons why we feel like it's a strategic imperative to get closer to our international markets, because we don't have this level of market insight that you're asking about in France. We're gaining it as we meet with clinicians, et cetera, and we've got a ton of research underway in preparation for all of this, but I can't give you that insight that you're looking for today. But next year, I probably will or sometime as we get a little bit closer to the transition. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: But I would assume that you guys do think that you're accelerating the adoption of comps, given the... Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yes. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: ... success you've had internationally. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yes. Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: In general, Europe is \u2013 the penetration rates are lower than it is in the United States. The attrition rate is also lower than it is in the United States. So it's... Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: And we have heard from clinicians that there's a large number of patients coming from multiple daily injections to the pod in France. I just don't know the specific numbers. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah. And then just as a follow-up maybe to the Animas question, I know Animas wasn't going to be maybe as big of a contributor in terms of patient adds each quarter, but as you focus a little bit on that population, is there any chance that that's going to distract you from typical patient adds, and is there going to be any impact on the P&L? Thanks. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: There will not be distraction. Most of this activity is actually handled internally. So the program went out through digital channels from both Dexcom and us. And that has increased our call volume, but most of that work is really handled by the internal team as opposed to the field team, who remain focused on our target segment, which is multiple daily injection users. In terms of impact to the P&L, I don't think there's any impact to the P&L either. Mike, you should confirm that. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. Really, it's just as what we said from a... Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: ...guidance perspective. And we think there are a number of opportunities to grow this business, and not only is MDI our traditional grower, but this is a nice opportunity. So it's all a net positive. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: And the beauty of a recurring revenue model, because we can get people a low cost or no cost pathway onto the system, because of the low upfront cost. Operator : Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Ryan Blicker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi, this is Ryan on for Doug. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe starting with one on Horizon. Dexcom, in their call yesterday, talked about having a clear path to getting a factory calibrated version of their G6 sensor on the market by the end of 2018. Is there any chance that you would be able to use that sensor as part of your first Horizon launch, or should we continue to think about it as the once-per-day calibrated G6? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: There is a chance and we're working very closely with Dexcom. So as they develop, we'll get our hands on that technology and do what we can to incorporate it and do technical feasibility. But right now, focused on G5 and G6, so once-a-day calibration in terms of the product development program. Ryan Blicker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Got it. And then maybe one on Drug Delivery. Is there anything you can say about progress with your existing Drug Delivery partners? And if not, do you believe one or more of your partners will be in a position to provide a public update in 2018? Thank you. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: It's tough to say. I think, unfortunately, we are under very tight confidentiality agreements with our pharmaceutical partners, and these are longer-term programs. There's a lot involved in the clinical and technical feasibility in terms of determining whether or not molecules are suited for the pod, and also if these molecules pass their early clinical endpoints. And so all of that is the work that's underway. We're certainly eager to be able to update everybody on the progress that we're making in a more tangible way. But at this point, we really can't do that, and I don't \u2013 I can't tell you today if there's going to be an update in 2018. But nonetheless, I don't want that to be taken as a diminishment of enthusiasm because we really are excited about this business, it's just a longer-term growth driver, and I think if we fast forward five to seven years, it's going to be a significant contributor in terms of a more diverse revenue stream. I just think it's going to be \u2013 it takes a while. Operator : Our next question comes from Kyle Rose with Canaccord. Kyle William Rose - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much for taking the question. Can you hear me all right? Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: Gotcha. Kyle William Rose - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: I just wanted to dovetail off the previous question about the Drug Delivery there while we're on the topic. I believe on this call last year, on the Q3 call, you talked about somewhere around you have five partnerships that are somewhere along the lines of four to five years to potentially come into market, is that still fair? Obviously, we've got one year down, so maybe it's still three to four years, so we're still \u2013 Lilly's still going to be the first partner that hits the market at some point in 2019? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: That's true of Lilly being the first partner, and I think it's generally true of the pipeline. The reason why we don't really give specific numbers of deals is not because we are not trying to be transparent, it's just that they're not \u2013 it's not really all that helpful or that indicative. You could have a partner like Amgen, which is a commercial product and a large scale, more near-term opportunity, or we could have a dozen really early stage technical feasibility agreements that have a lot more risk associated with them in terms of whether or not they need their endpoints and actually become revenue-generating opportunities for us. So we didn't want to mislead all of you in terms of the number of deals as they get larger versus the risk/reward of that, and that's why we stopped giving that insight, but generally, still a number of deals, still Lilly be the first and we're looking forward to updating everybody in terms of the progress that we make as soon as we can become public with these partnerships. Kyle William Rose - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. I appreciate the extra color there. And then two quick questions, one, any expectation, obviously, you're building out a major infrastructure internationally to support that transition. But you've got a major new product launch with Dash coming in mid-2018. Just any expectations for investments in the U.S. operations, feet on the street clinical reps, so we think about exiting 2017 and in the first half of 2018 to start for the launch? And then secondarily, can you just give us a refresh on the timelines for Horizon? You talked about the third IDE now, when can we expect (46:03) get approval? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. So in terms of increasing the sales footprint, I mean, we're always evaluating that, we're about a year out from when we first \u2013 when we last expanded the sales force and so that's approaching productivity in exactly where we expected to be. And so, we're always evaluating that, and I don't think we're prepared to exactly give guidance on the key investments in 2018, but certainly, we'll make sure that we are appropriately, commercially resourced for a successful launch of Dash in 2018, but we'll give you more color on that in February. And then I think the other question was around Horizon timing. We're on track with our clinical development just as we expected. And as we do, as we did with Dash and we do with all of our development programs, we're going to review the data that comes out of this IDE, and any insights that come in and we'll adjust accordingly. But so far, it's going very well, progressing nicely, and we're excited about its performance. So no change in terms of end of 2019, early 2020 in terms of the guidance at this point, but I would just point out, two years out, so we're working hard and we're going to keep you guys updated as we make progress. But over the next couple of years, we're going to bring really meaningful innovation to the market with Dash and with concentrated insulin. I mean, it's really \u2013 Dash is really a giant leap forward with mobile capabilities and serious user experience enhancements, and we're really excited about that. For the first time ever, people are going to be able to see and use their Omnipod data on their mobile phone, and payers are going to get data analytics, and physicians, they're going to get population analytics in a way that we hadn't before, so we're really excited about that in the meantime. And the other thing that's happening, just as it relates to Horizon, which is I think something that could potentially impact how we think about the program is, we're learning a lot in the market about the needs for automated insulin delivery, what it takes to launch these systems really effectively, how to train users and clinicians efficiently, and how to get market access. So there's just a lot of ground that is being hoed right now, frankly by another, and we're really fortunate to be able to take those lessons and incorporate them into our program. Kyle William Rose - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much for taking the questions. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Tao Levy with Wedbush. Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. (48:36). Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Hey, Tao. Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Hey. Maybe the first, you talked about how you've hosted some events already in Europe. Was that in coordination with Ypsomed, or are you guys kind of just \u2013 you're doing these events on your own to generate interest? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Well, I guess, coordinated, meaning, of course, they knew we were doing that and I think they were in attendance of all, if not most of those events, but no, we didn't actually kind of fund them and execute them together. Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay, so I mean, is it possible that some of the growth that you're seeing internationally is the result of additional marketing events that now both parties are reporting on? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: I don't think so. I think those \u2013 first of all, most of those happened in the last month. So, I don't think they're... Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: ...driving significant \u2013 and they were clinician-oriented with the exception of one that happened last week, they were clinician-oriented events. (49:36) Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: Just getting enough to chat, right. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: So we're new into the European market, and I think hosting those types of events gives us access and face time with clinicians and patients. Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Got you. And then just any update on France on the reimbursement front? I thought there's a chance that they might reduce reimbursement to there. And if they do, will you lower your sales price to Ypsomed, so that they'd continue to be incentivized to sell the product there? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Our pricing to Ypsomed is an aggregate across the continent. So I don't think we would lower it... Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: ...because of (50:17) market, but there's \u2013 we feel as if reimbursement is in good shape there. So... Tao L. Levy - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with Leerink Partners. Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question, and congrats on another great quarter. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Thanks, Danielle. Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC : No problem. Two quick questions. One on the U.S. Omnipod business, one on International. So first on the U.S., Shacey, you still are outperforming at least our expectations and I think consensus expectations in the U.S. What are you seeing in that business? It sounds like the installed base grew as you expected. So is it higher utilization, are you getting higher ASPs, is the distributor mix changing, what's going on there that's driving some of the better than expected performance? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: I'd say there's incremental improvements across kind of all of those things. Net utilization or so (51:12), I don't think we see users using more pods in a given time period. But we continue to see healthcare practitioner utilization rates improve. We continue to see great growth on the installed base and likely moving some needle on attrition, although it's an estimate and I couldn't give you a specific there. But we're just thinking great progress on market access and product quality and resulting improving the customer experience. So that's \u2013 and then we've had some positive channel mix, too, so all of that is driving continued favorability with that business. Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC : Got it. That's helpful. And then shifting to International, and when you guys do go direct there, I think the last country where you went direct in a similar manner, correct me if I'm wrong, was Canada? And... Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC : ...I'm wondering and you highlighted that, today, is the strong growth driver. So I'm wondering if you could give some color on how you saw the installed base growth accelerate in Canada, and whether that might be a proxy for what we could see when you take over in Europe. Thanks so much. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. Yeah, Canada for us has been a terrific success. We bought that distribution back from GSK now, I guess, two years ago, little over two years ago. And we've just seen the market really step function change and our growth in terms of new product or new patient starts there, and a really strong team, really smooth transition of that business. So we did view Canada very much as kind of a indicator of can we do this, and how would we do this, and so I think we've got a great blueprint there in terms of how we're going to successfully transition the markets in Europe. I think the other thing is, the markets in Europe are very discrete. We've said it before, but maybe not on this call yet, there's really four major markets that account for 70-plus percent of the business, and when you add the Nordics, then you're up to almost 95% of the business. So it's a really concentrated business, and several of those markets are served by third-party distributors, and so just a pretty straightforward, discrete business that we need to transfer, but Canada was certainly proof in principle that we can do this, and we know how to do it successfully and ensure patient continuity of care. Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC : All right. Thanks so much. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Thanks, Danielle. Operator : Our next question comes from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good afternoon and congrats on the progress. So, just a couple, on the international growth, you grew at north of 20% quarter-on-quarter in Europe over the summer months, and it seems like there's always a sequentially lift in the international business in 3Q, but this quarter certainly was more pronounced, it was off a larger base. So, my question is, were there any new countries that Ypsomed sold to in the third quarter here, or was there any new reimbursement that was added that could kind of explain the sequential jump? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: No, Jayson, there were no new countries added, and we don't anticipate entering into any new countries until after we have transitioned the business in Europe, continued strong growth in some of our newer countries like France, and then just really strong growth across the continent in some of the countries that I mentioned, but no \u2013 nothing changed in terms of the market dynamics that drove that. Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And can you remind us when did Ypsomed start selling Omnipod in France? Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: It was the middle of last year. This is Mike. It was... Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: July? Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. It was the \u2013 I think towards the end of Q2 roughly. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: I mean it really materially impacted \u2013 the significant part of the growth really happened in the latter half of the year and then just continued to accelerate through the beginning of this year. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And just as a follow-up, the Drug Delivery business in the fourth quarter, the implied guidance is down year-over-year, quarter-on-quarter. You mentioned, Mike, something around the timing of orders. Can you just explain what went on there, and then also, is this a segment that you would expect to return to growth in 2018? Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: Well, I think it's fair to say consistent \u2013 there's nothing new in terms of our description of the Drug Delivery business in that over the last couple years, we've said that we work with \u2013 Amgen is the largest piece of it. We work with them on their forecast to try and even out the production throughout the year, it's not a perfect science, there's always timing that works with the timing of shipments between quarters, we saw that last year between Q3 and Q4, we saw it this year between Q3 and what we expect for Q4. The guidance for the year has not changed at all. So there's just puts and takes, it's not a perfect science in terms of getting it even by quarter, but the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year, and we've confirmed here, implies just over $18 million a quarter if you spread it perfectly even, which is pretty much in line with what we're saying for the fourth quarter. So there's really nothing to speak of there. As it relates to 2018, we'll be giving the guidance for that in February, but what I will say about 2018 is just we're very, very pleased with the momentum that we have this year, and we're very excited going into next year, so we're looking forward to February. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Suraj Kalia with Northland Securities. Suraj Kalia - Northland Securities, Inc.: Good afternoon, everyone. Congrats on an excellent quarter. So, Pat and Shacey, let me \u2013 for either of you, let me start out. If Libre has issues within the hyperglycemic range as most of the data seems to indicate, would that prevent you all from creating an Omnipod integrated with Libre? And the reason I ask is, we know the numbers for Libre in Europe. I think, so you guys are pretty well aware of the replacement claim they have in the U.S. Just curious if that's on the radar screen if it's even a possibility, what makes sense or what doesn't make sense with such a configuration? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: I think you have to ask what does integration mean. We made a strategic decision to kind of go to the mobile phone and really put our data on the mobile phone because all of our customers and all of our market research was indicating that that's where people really wanted their data. It's where, for example, in Europe, customers are viewing and using their Libre data, and it's also where everybody in the United States using G5 and most of the people in Europe using G5 are also going for their data. So, our kind of strategic rationale was put Omnipod on the phone, give our users an integrated experience, so that they can view their Omnipod data right where they view whatever sensor data that they're using and whatever generation of that sensor data that they're using. And so, that's been our approach and I think we're really excited about Dash starting to enable that user experience for our population. We do know in Europe that there are plenty of Omnipod users who are also using Libre and having a great experience. And so, we know that that's happening today, people are really getting a good user experience with both of those products. Suraj Kalia - Northland Securities, Inc.: And Shacey, you mentioned about Dash, am I right in saying that there should not be any DME-based reimbursement issues in some of the criteria that are popping up on the CGM side in terms of the receivers and seeing things on the PDDA (59:06) or your smartphone, those kind of issues are not there on the pump side. Am I right in saying that? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: I think that issue that you're describing is primarily tied to Medicare DME reimbursements, and we do not \u2013 until Pat secures it, we do not have Medicare reimbursement, so we don't have that problem. Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: Thanks for the dig. No, we were going after either Medicare Part B or Part D, and I think the Omnipod fits more nicely into the Medicare Part D, but we're happy with either one of those reimbursement schemes from CMS and are prepared to deal with it if we need to. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Steven Lichtman with Oppenheimer. Steven Lichtman - Oppenheimer: Thanks. Hi, guys. On the $45 million to $50 million OpEx investment run rate o-U.S. to go direct, how many salespeople does that get you to approximately in comparison what Ypsomed has today on the ground, and where does that feet on the street need to go to in your view over the next few years? Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: This is Mike. I'll speak to that, and Shacey can add anything if she'd like obviously. So one thing that's really important to understand, and Shacey alluded to this in her comments, about the markets that we're in in Europe. First of all, they're very concentrated, and second of all, they're different from one another. And so, as an example, in France and in a few other markets, you're really dealing in France, so let me call that one out specifically. You're dealing with home health providers. And so, you're not allowed to interact directly with patients, or I should say to sell directly to patients, and so the go-to-market strategy is very different than where you might be, than what you'd see in the United States or what you might see in Canada from a go-to-market. So the number of people you need to have is different. And because we're concentrated in a few core markets, we are in multiple other markets in Europe, much smaller in nature, and those we may continue to use distributors in those markets. So, in terms of the number of people that we might have by country, it really is going to vary based upon the needs in that country. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. I think Mike is right on. The only thing I would add is, we're going to continue as that business continues to grow as we enter into new markets, we will continually evaluate just as we have in the United States what is the right commercial footprint, so that we can best support that growth and best support our customer base. Steven Lichtman - Oppenheimer: Great. Thanks for that. And then, sorry, I just want one quick clarification. Is any of the $45 million to $50 million here in 2017, or is that separate from some of the stand-up costs you've started on? Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: So we are having some of the recurring spending starting in 2017, as we've said, we've been establishing operations in Europe, and that will be part of the $45 million to $50 million. But they're also our startup costs. Most of the startup costs, we currently estimate them as we said on the last call, to be about $10 million, most of those will probably be in the first half of 2018. The numbers this year are starting, but they are much smaller in nature. Steven Lichtman - Oppenheimer: Got it. Thanks, Mike. Thanks, Shacey. Operator : And I'm not showing any further question at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Patrick Sullivan. Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: Thank you, operator. In closing, I am absolutely thrilled with the outstanding performance this quarter and very proud of the track record of the team of strong quarter-over-quarter growth. The team is dedicated to improving the customer experience, raising the bar on product quality, delivering actual (01:02:47) operational excellence, and creating an organization for long-term success. I'd also like to thank the Insulet employees for their hard work and dedication to ease the burden and improve the lives of people living with diabetes and other diseases. Thank you for joining us on the call today, and we look forward to speaking with you at our fourth quarter earnings call in February. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Deborah Gordon : Thank you, Brian. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2017 earnings call. Joining me today are Patrick Sullivan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Shacey Petrovic, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Michael Levitz, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The replay of this call will be archived on our website, and our press release discussing our fourth quarter 2017 results and first quarter and full-year 2018 guidance is also available in the IR section of our website. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to be materially different from any future results implied by such statements. Such factors include those referenced in our Safe Harbor statement, in our fourth quarter earnings release, and in the company's filings with the SEC. Also unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis. With that, I will turn the call over to Pat. Patrick Sullivan : Thank you, Deb and good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Insulet\u2019s fourth quarter and 2017 conference call. I\u2019ll start off the call with an overview of the business highlights and financial performance for Q4 and full year 2017. Mike will follow with details on our Q4 and 2017 financial results as well as provide 2018 guidance. Shacey will then provide details of our commercial initiatives and an update on our R&D progress. We\u2019ll then open up the call for questions. 2017 was simply a spectacular year for the company and a year of significant accomplishments. Number one on my list was gaining CMS Medicare Part D coverage guidance for the Omnipod system. Number two, we submitted DASH, our next generation product platform to the FDA. We're implementing our plan to go direct in Europe and we broke ground on our US manufacturing plant in Acton, Massachusetts and we delivered a very strong Q4 and 2017 results, including growth of over 30% in our worldwide customer base. The first four are not only our accomplishments for 2017, but importantly our priorities for this year to fuel our growth in 2019 and into the future, namely securing Omnipod Medicare coverage with Part D sponsors, launching the DASH product platform, transitioning our European business through direct distribution and implementing our US manufacturing strategy. I'll start off with the great news on CMS coverage for the Omnipod. On January the 5, CMS issued guidance clarifying that Medicare Part D sponsors are now permitted to provide coverage for products such as the Omnipod under the Part D Prescription Drug program. The 450,000 individuals were Type 1 diabetes in the United States, roughly a third of the market who have Medicare or Medicaid coverage will now have a pathway to access the Omnipod. Our users who are in Medicare and those that age into Medicare will now have the opportunity to continue to use Omnipod. They will no longer be faced with paying out of pocket for their life sustaining Omnipod or transitioning to a less attractive alternative. Achieving Medicare coverage is a monumental accomplishment and a tremendous benefit to our Omnipod Medicare beneficiaries. Medicare Part D through the pharmacy channel is a clear differentiator and a competitive advantage for Insulet. The pharmacy channel will provide easier access to Omnipod since it\u2019s simpler for physicians to prescribe in this channel. And it will also provide our users with a better patient experience, since they will be able to access the Omnipod in the same channel as they do their prescription drugs. Securing Medicare Part D coverage provides us with a direct pathway to secure Medicaid state coverage since most of the Medicaid plans follow the CMS prescription drug coverage guidance. For those individuals on Medicaid, particularly the pediatric population, Omnipod will finally become a choice. We expect the benefits of Medicare coverage to begin in 2019 and during this year our market access team will focus on placing Omnipod on the formulary of the Part D sponsors. In the meantime, our customer service team will work with our current Medicare customers to gain access this year to the Part D exception process. Achieving Medicare Part D coverage is a huge win for Omnipod patients, physicians and the diabetes community. Next an update on DASH. Last month, we submitted a 510(k) to the FDA for the Omnipod DASH system, our next generation mobile platform. We are very excited about the significant potential of this state-of-the-art innovation and what it means for Insulet and our customers. DASH is the mobile platform for all of our innovation pipeline, including U-200 and U-500 programs with Lilly and our Horizon Automated Glucose Control System. The launch of DASH is of course dependent upon FDA clearance, which we expect in the second half of this year. Now turning to the transitioning of our European business, we're on track with our transition to direct distribution of our Omnipod system in Europe on July the 1. I am thrilled with our European team\u2019s exceptional execution. I'm also impressed with the level of experience and market knowledge of the team we're building on the ground in Europe. Last week, I attended the Advanced Technologies and Treatment of Diabetes or the ATTD meeting in Vienna, Austria, where we exhibited for the very first time as Insulet in Europe.  We had an incredibly busy and successful several days at the event, including a large number of visitors at our booth in the exhibition hall and many meetings with healthcare providers, commercial partners and our European physician advisory board. We also conducted an Insulet symposium attended by 120 participants, focused on an innovation pipeline. The latest on Horizon and clinical progress, a data review of 40,000 patients and results of a real world Omnipod experience from researchers in Europe. The International customer base at the end of last year was estimated at nearly 65,000 with a vast majority in Europe and we expect the international customer base to continue to grow this year. While we truly appreciate the level of work required to ensure the continuity of care and to deliver the best possible customer experience as we transition to direct distribution in Europe, our team has the skills and talent necessary to transition this business successfully and I'm looking forward to direct distribution on July the 1. This transition is a huge opportunity for our European customers and significantly improves our financial profile in the second half of this year, as Mike will describe shortly. Now, turning to manufacturing. We have made significant improvements across our manufacturing and supply chain operations and continue to drive increased daily production volume with less headcount and scrap, while delivering superior quality and reliable products. This sustained outstanding production performance continues to drive sizable improvements in our gross margin and we have a very clear line of sight to 70% margins for the business in 2021. We're on track to begin production in our new state of the art manufacturing facility in Massachusetts in 2019, which will also serve as a site of our new global headquarters. We will build out the facility and install the automation equipment later this year and expect to start production in early 2019. The new facility will provide increased capacity and second source redundancy to support our significant growth trajectory. Operational excellence is at the core of who we are and what we do and it's a key success factor for this business. Finally, let's turn to our financial results, which evidenced our outstanding performance and strong momentum. We exceeded guidance and delivered strong performance across our business in 2017 with revenue or $464 million, a growth of 26% year-over-year and $6 million above the midpoint of our most recent guidance range. US Omnipod revenue was more than $271 million, growing 18%. International Omnipod was $120 million, growing 67% and drug delivery was 72 million, growing 11%. Our full year gross margin was 60%, an improvement of more than 200 basis points from last year. The year 2017 was a year of significant accomplishments and performance. During the year, we laid the foundation for further growth and profitability. As a result of the positive momentum we built in 2017, this year is shaping up to be another very exciting year for the company. We are very confident in our 2021 targets of $1 billion in revenue, 70% gross margin and above market profitability.  The future beyond 2021 is rich with significant opportunities for growth through our innovation pipeline and further geographic expansion. We are focusing on delivering innovation to our customers worldwide and superior returns for our shareholders. I'm proud of the team's execution and exceptional performance in 2017, their focus on our 2018 priorities and excited about the extraordinary bright future ahead of us. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike. Michael? Michael Levitz : Thank you, Pat. I echo Pat\u2019s excitement about the incredible year we had in 2017 and the strong positive indicators we're already seeing for 2018. I will now walk you through our fourth quarter results and then discuss first quarter and full year 2018 guidance. We're very pleased to report fourth quarter year-over-year revenue growth of 26% with revenue of $130.5 million. We exceeded the midpoint of our stated guidance by $6 million with two-thirds of the beat coming from US Omnipod due to our growing customer base and the remainder of the beat coming from international Omnipod due to momentum across our markets, including continued strength in France.  Our gross margin increased 210 basis points to 60.9%. This significant growth is primarily from the improvements we've made in our manufacturing and supply chain operations that Pat just outlined, offset in part by unfavorable mix due to faster growing international distributor sales. In just the last few years, as a result of the team's incredible execution and discipline to drive improvements in both quality and efficiency, we have seen growth from a mid-40% gross margin range to over 60% and growing.  We are targeting gross margin approaching 70% in 2021 and we expect to make considerable headway toward that goal this year, even before lower cost US manufacturing begins next year. Our operating expenses increased to $80 million compared to 65 million, in line with expectation and the net result was a small operating loss in the fourth quarter and it positions us well for achieving our 2018 objectives. We ended the year with more than $565 million in cash and investments on our balance sheet, up from 300 million at the end of 2016. In November, we issued over $400 million in convertible notes and we subsequently used the proceeds to repurchase existing higher coupon notes with net proceeds of over $290 million. During 2017, we generated over $40 million in cash from operations, a significant improvement from prior years.  We've spent 77 million on capital expenditures to support the growth of our business, most notably for our investment in US manufacturing and supply chain operations. We expect our capital expenditures in 2018 to increase from 2017 as we complete development of our new US operations which as Pat said, is on schedule to begin pod production in early 2019. We're very pleased with our strong financial position as we make valuable strategic investments in support of our organic growth opportunities. I will now walk you through our 2018 outlook. For the full year, we expect total revenue in the range of $560 million to $580 million, representing growth of 21% to 25%. First, we expect US Omnipod revenue in the range of $316 million to $323 million, representing growth of 16% to 19%. This primarily reflects continued strong growth in our US customer base, which Shacey will describe shortly. In 2018, we expect international Omnipod revenue in the range of $185 million to $194 million, representing growth of 54% to 62%. This exceptional growth will be driven by three factors. First, capturing more of the value of existing end user pricing in Europe, up approximately 50% from our historic distributor pricing after we assumed direct operations July 1. Second, the full year impact of the significant increase in Omnipod adoption in 2017. And third, continued growth in our customer base in existing markets even as our top priority in 2018 will be customer continuity through the transition to direct operations. For drug delivery, we expect revenue in the range of $59 million to $63 million, representing a decline of 13% to 18%. This decrease reflects the current forecast from Amgen. Now, for the first quarter of 2018, we expect total revenue in the range of $119 million to $123 million, representing growth of 17% to 21%. At a product line level, we expect US Omnipod in the range of $68.5 million to $70 million, representing growth of 15% to 17%. We expect international Omnipod in the range of $36.5 million to $38 million, representing growth of 45% to 51%. And we expect drug delivery in the range of $14 million to $15 million, representing a decline of 2 million to 3 million.  Please note that our guidance reflects the adoption of new revenue related accounting standards effective for 2018, which are presented prospectively in our P&L. We do not expect this to have a material impact on our financial trends. Specifically, the adoption of these rules increased our guidance for full year 2018 revenue by less than 1% or approximately $5 million, including $2 million of non-recurring international revenue spread evenly over the first half of 2018 and $3 million in drug delivery spread throughout the year. For the first quarter, the adoption of these rules increased guidance by approximately $2 million, split evenly between international and drug delivery. Now moving to gross margin, following our gross margin expansion of 230 basis points in 2017, we expect full year 2018 gross margin will again increase significantly, up over 300 basis points to 63% to 64%, driven by continued operational improvements and the partial year impact of assuming direct European operations July 1. As we stated previously, we expect an annual run rate margin increase of approximately 400 basis points beginning July 1. As such, we expect our consolidated gross margin in the first half of the year to be 60% to 61% and increasing to 64% to 65% in the second half of 2018. To achieve our revenue growth and profitability goals, we will continue to invest in our business, including incremental investments in 2018 to establish both direct operations in Europe mid-year and in-house manufacturing in the United States for production to begin in early 2019. We expect full year 2018 operating expenses to increase up to 25%, but to remain relatively consistent as a percentage of revenue even with the cost to establish our new European infrastructure. Outside of the investments in Europe and US manufacturing, the increase in operating expenses includes continued investment in our exciting innovation pipeline as well as expansion of our commercial teams to meet the growing demand that we're seeing and take advantage of CMS\u2019s decision that Omnipod is coverable under the Part D drug benefit. Please note that our expenses in 2018 will also be impacted by the adoption of the new accounting standards, requiring capitalization of sales commissions to be amortized over the period of benefit. The adoption of these rules will reduce our expenses in 2018 by approximately 1% to $4 million. As previously stated, we expect the transition to direct European operations will require ongoing run rate European expenses of $45 million to $50 million, which are included in the stated 2018 guidance. We also expect certain non-recurring costs associated with this transition, including $7 million to $8 million primarily in the first half of 2018 as we establish our operations. In addition, we\u2019ll pay a terminations fee to our European distributor based on our contract with them. While the amount will be determined over the year after we assumed direct operations and it could vary significantly based on the terms of the agreement, we do not expect the fee to have a material impact on our financial trends as it will be amortized on our P&L over the multi-year period of benefit. Finally, we expect to make the pivot to operating profit this year with full 2018 operating margins in the low single digit percentage range. This reflects European infrastructure investments beginning at the start of the year before direct European revenues begin July 1. As such, we expect operating margin in the first half to increase sequentially over 400 basis points in the second half of 2018. In summary, 2017 was a tremendous year of growth and development for Insulet and 2018 looks to be our most exciting and fulfilling yet, where we deliver strong growth at the top line, further expansion in gross margins and positive operating income for the first time in the company's history even with the investments in Europe and US manufacturing that will accelerate earnings growth in 2019 and beyond and we're just getting started. I will now turn the call over to Shacey. Shacey Petrovic : Thanks, Mike. I share the enthusiasm about our team\u2019s accomplishments in 2017 and we are off to a terrific start in 2018. Building on what Pat and Mike have shared with you, I will cover our growing global customer base, including where we ended 2017 and where we expect the strong momentum to take us in 2018. And then I'll discuss our strategic imperatives for the year ahead. Our commercial strategies are clearly driving tremendous revenue and customer base growth. As a reminder, because of Omnipod\u2019s recurring revenue model, the customer base growth is the best predictor of revenue growth. Our global customer base total is an estimate, because half of our US base and the majority of our international base go through third-party distributors. We ended 2017 with an estimated global customer base between 140,000 and 145,000 active users, which represents a year-over-year increase of over 30% and drove our strong company revenue growth. We grew our US customer base by approximately 17% and our international base by approximately 60%. By the end of 2017, our customer mix approximated 55% in the US and 45% in international markets. Given this great momentum and how well positioned our commercial team is to capitalize on our strength in the market, we will drive robust growth again in 2018. We expect our US customer base will grow approximately 15% to 18% this year. In the US, our investments in increasing the footprint of our field team, raising awareness and driving broader market access, supported by strong commercial execution are paying off and will continue to deliver growth. As you know, this year in Europe, our mission is to successfully transition our business and ensure continuity of care and world class support for our existing customers. There is an incredible opportunity in Europe to grow our customer base over the medium and long term, but this year's success will be driven by our change to a direct business model, which significantly benefits our revenue and gross margin in the second half of this year. Naturally, there will be a period of transition and adjustment, but overall we expect to grow our international customer base approximately 20% to 25%, which coupled with our strong US growth will drive global customer base growth of approximately 20%. In 2018, our commercial teams will focus on three key strategic initiatives. One is to secure widespread Medicare pharmacy coverage for Omnipod, starting in 2019 and to expand Omnipod coverage through the pharmacy channel with Medicaid and existing commercial payers. Two is to continue our development work focused on a clearly differentiated, rich and innovative product pipeline, including this year's launch of our new Omnipod DASH mobile platform. Three is to stand up our European operations and successfully transition this business. Starting with Medicare, as Pat noted, gaining Medicare coverage of our Omnipod system is a big win. It's a win for our customers, a win for the physicians who treat them and it's a win for the diabetes community who may now access innovative technology and choose the device that best suits their needs. Coverage through the pharmacy channel provides our users an improved overall experience with broader and easier access through our pharmacy benefits. A growing portion of our business is already through the pharmacy channel where our customers are getting their insulin and their diabetes supplies. We hear from clinics and patients that this provides for more efficient, less burdensome access. This is also true for our company. In the pharmacy channel, there are typically less hurdles to receive pods, the turnaround time for new customers is typically a fraction of the time through traditional DME and patients are no longer subject to the challenges of large deductibles. The pharmacy channel is a great option for a growing percentage of our commercially covered users and has the potential to offer our Medicare beneficiaries similar advantages. Between now and Q3 when most of the Medicare Part D plan sponsors establish their reimbursement and coverage policies for 2019, we will work to secure access, so Omnipod is included in their formulary benefits at the start of next year. We also have the benefit of negotiating with a relatively small number of planned sponsors as the top three represent approximately 60% of Medicare Part D covered life and the top eight cover approximately 80%. We are currently in discussions with all of these planned sponsors. At the same time, CMS\u2019s Medicare guidance should help accelerate widespread state Medicaid access and we are in the process of establishing coverage with these plans. Omnipod\u2019s low upfront cost and differentiated form factor provide a strong value proposition and we are confident we will secure broad access for Omnipod on Medicare Part D and Medicaid plans for 2019. Next, our innovation efforts. We achieved another significant milestone last month with the filing of our 510(k) for FDA clearance of Omnipod DASH. At the core of this innovative technology is our drive for simplicity and ease of use. And what is so important and so unique about DASH is that it provides benefits across all stakeholders, patients, clinicians and payers. We designed DASH through the eyes of our customers, with a keen focus on ease of use through mobile technology. DASH is unlike any other product in the market. With the addition of secure Bluetooth connectivity, DASH will provide mobile phone display for our users and mobile apps for their caregivers in addition to data and insights for patients, physicians and payers. For patients, this means incredibly easy and well controlled informed delivery with their pod now controlled by a new modern touchscreen PDM. Their data will also be accessible via our Omnipod display apps on their smartphone and they will have the added benefit of sharing their data with caregivers through our Omnipod View app. For clinicians, DASH means easier patient on boarding, including less training time and immediate access to patients\u2019 diabetes data.  And payers will have the ability to access detailed data on their specific membership populations through our Omnipod DASH boards. Payers can drill down into outcomes data by patient demographics, geography and behaviors to better understand Omnipod\u2019s link to improved outcomes. We\u2019ll work with the FDA as they progress through their review of DASH and look forward to a limited market launch later this year. Our DASH platform is the foundation for future innovation, including our development programs for Omnipod U-200 and U-500 concentrated insulin and our Omnipod Horizon Automated Glucose Control System.  We are making substantive progress with all of this development work and we're on track to introduce these products into the market over the next few years. We are eager to share our exciting development milestones with you as the year progresses. We're confident that we're on an innovation pathway that will continue to differentiate Omnipod in the market and that will provide our users, their physicians and payers with a world class experience with access to critical data insights and with demonstrated outcomes. In our drug delivery product line, we were mainly excited about what an attractive opportunity this business represents over the long term as well as the recurring revenue stream it currently generates. Today, the product line primarily reflects sales to Amgen for their Neulasta Onpro kit. As Amgen recently noted, adoption exited the fourth quarter of 2017 at just over 60% of all US Neulasta doses sold. We continue to have active discussions and explore opportunities with pharmaceutical partners and based on their feedback believe our pod platform provides a truly unique product offering. Omnipod\u2019s wearable, connected delivery platform has the potential to improve adherence and outcomes and we remain confident that other non-informed therapies will also incorporate our pod differentiated technology. Now, turning to our international business and the exciting progress we've made expanding our European infrastructure to support a successful transition of our Omnipod customers on July 1. We are hitting all of our key milestones in a very thoughtful and very thorough strategic plan and we're benefiting from the considerable expertise of our new European management team. Our newly hired team includes commercial leaders throughout various European geographies within the areas of sales, market access, customer service and all other key support functions.  This team brings an incredible amount of diabetes experience and importantly a deep knowledge of European market dynamics. Thanks to this talented team and the support of the diabetes community, payers and business partners, we continue to gain deep insight into our key market leads and prepare for a seamless transition on day one. One of the key learnings we've had is that the vast majority of this business is served through intermediaries, which reduces the number of parties we have to contract with and mitigates transition risk.  So in addition to the concentration of our Omnipod business within Europe, 90% of the volume exists in five major markets. We also have this further concentration among these intermediaries within those markets. As we move through this transition, we are increasingly confident that our move to direct distribution will provide meaningful benefits to all of our key stakeholders and set us up to drive significant long term value.  As we grow, we continue to build the clinical evidence, supporting the strength of Omnipod through additional studies and within peer reviewed publications across the globe. We are thrilled to announce two clinical publications this month. The first is the German Austrian Registry Manuscript comparing adolescents who switched to Omnipod from multiple daily injections and it was published in Pediatric Diabetes, demonstrating that Omnipod was associated with improved glycemic control after one year. Our second publication highlighted the results of the first IDE for our Omnipod Horizon and was published in the journal, Diabetes Technology and Therapeutic. Also just last week, at ATTD in Vienna, there were two presentations from our second Horizon IDE study, examining meal time challenges and exercise in adults with type 1 diabetes. These data further demonstrate that our algorithm continues to perform very well and additional studies are underway, examining longer system use in free living setting. At ATTD, we also presented real world data of Omnipod in use in the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom. We are building a strong body of clinical support and generating greater awareness of the benefits of our technology throughout the global diabetes community. In closing, I am incredibly proud of our team's accomplishments. We continue to drive robust near term growth throughout our business, while executing on our strategic imperatives to strengthen our foundation for long term profitable growth. We are excited about our significant opportunities in 2018 and even more so for 2019 and beyond. We have created tremendous value for Insulet\u2019s shareholders and improve the lives of more than 140,000 people living with diabetes and we're just getting started. With that operator, let\u2019s open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays. Matt Taylor : So the first question I wanted to ask you was, given the 17% growth that you estimated for the US customer base, you've got some good things going on here in 2018 and I know you're assuming no Medicare, but could you walk us through some of the assumptions that get you to the 15% to 18% to start out and where there might be some pluses and minuses versus last year. Shacey Petrovic : Sure. Matt, maybe, I'll start and Mike you can add what\u2019s factored into the guidance. But essentially, that's coming from our investment in expansion of the sales force. So in the United States, we made an investment to increase our field footprint and the sales support staff by about 20% or 25%. And to that is certainly driving benefit. We continue to make strides in terms of market access. So while we believe that the vast majority of that impact will hit us in 2019 as we really unlock coverage and access in Medicare and Medicaid, it doesn't mean that we're not going to continue to drive improved access through the Medicaid channel in 2018. And then finally, we continue to invest in awareness in the United States to continue to grow the education and around the benefits of Omnipod. So I\u2019d say those three things are driving our growth in the United States. Michael Levitz : And Matt, this is Mike. As it relates to the guidance, so just as a reminder, there is some seasonality in our business in the US Omnipod business. It generally surrounds the reset of deductibles and so what we\u2019ve described is that installed base that as you mentioned, our customer base is a really -- it's probably the best indicator for the growth of the business, but that's definitely more true on a full-year basis than it might be in Q1 versus another quarter just because of those reset of deductibles. And so sometimes, people will purchase more in the fourth quarter before their deductible resets, have a slower Q1 and then they'll pick up in Q2. The guidance for Q1 is really not indicative of anything other than just that dynamic. As you can see what the guidance we gave for the year, it's very strong growth for the year and we really believe we have a tremendous amount of momentum. Matt Taylor : And just one follow-up, you mentioned the strength in France, which was a real strong area of growth for you in 2017. Can you talk about the trend there and whether you think you maybe topping up, help us understand how that is progressing, whether there is any other market specific dynamics internationally that we should think about aside from the transition? Shacey Petrovic : Sure. And so France continues to be a very strong performer for us. It now accounts for -- still accounts for about a third of our international business. And while the growth has started to temper, I would say, it was extraordinary for about a year and a half to two years and we're still seeing really nice growth out of the market. So we said all along, we were new into the market a couple of years ago. We said all along eventually, the test has sort of tempered down. I would say it\u2019s still strong, but softening a little bit from where it was last year. Michael Levitz : And Matt, just to clarify, this is Mike. It's exactly where we expected it would be. So this is all what we expected. Shacey Petrovic : And then, I think your other question Matt was just around other factors or contemplation in terms of the European transition, what we wanted to communicate is obviously we feel great about the team's preparation and execution in transitioning this business, but our focus in 2018 is really on customer continuity for our existing customers, which is why you see a little bit tempering of the installed base growth. So despite this transition, we fully expect that both Europe and our international market customer base will continue to grow in 2018, but a lot of the revenue growth is going to come from the pricing uptick in the second half as opposed to the installed base growth. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Jayson Bedford : So I guess just to start and I guess it's somewhat tied to the first question, the geographic mix of the user base was a bit different than I thought. The US was stronger than anticipated in the implied basis, higher than what we had. I'm wondering if you saw any benefit in the fourth quarter from some of the competitive disruption in the US market. Shacey Petrovic : We did see some benefit. I wouldn't say it was huge or outsized. So, we did have obviously pathways for people to access Omnipod with no upfront cost, if they were transitioning off of Animas and that accounted for maybe 10% to 15% max of our new patient starts. And then, just as a reminder, I know you know this, but in any given quarter, our new patient starts don't really drive a significant increase in revenue. So, it certainly added a little bit to our installed base growth, but it was a strong quarter across a number of fronts in the United States. Jayson Bedford : I guess just as a related follow-up then, you exceeded the high end of your US range for the fourth quarter. What differed from your expectation three, four months ago? Michael Levitz : This is Mike. A few things. One of the things I described in Matt\u2019s question is just the dynamic of how people purchase their product. And what we saw is, we saw an increasing amount of reorders in the fourth quarter. Sometimes, people do that because again typically because they have maybe higher deductible plans or other things like that and their planned deductibles reset in the first quarter. So that was higher than what we expected. Our growth was higher than what we expected. We had been guiding to installed base growth of about 15% and as Shacey described, our customer base grew 17%. So, that -- we just are seeing tremendous excitement and momentum in terms of the growth of the business and that's what drove the outperformance. Shacey Petrovic : Yeah. And that's kind of why I'm reluctant to say it was sort of down to Animas, because in fact in Q4, we had more MDI new patients to Omnipod than in any preceding quarters. So, it was a really strong quarter from a new patient start standpoint, just independent of the programs that we have going. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. David Lewis : Just a couple of quick questions for me on some of these themes. Shacey, just thinking about international, if my math is right, your underlying guidance or underlying performance internationally is like 30% to 38%, sort of how you see the international growth rates and relative to the 60% you put up this year, can you just give us a greater sense of how you're thinking about that number for France and the trend there and then some of that disruption. Shacey Petrovic : Yeah, maybe I'll let Mike comment specifically on the numbers and I can certainly give some color in terms of what we're seeing in the market and how we feel about the opportunity set there. Michael Levitz : Sure. So it relates to the specific revenue guidance, one of the things that we've been saying for quite some time now as we've been talking or it feels like quite some time, as we've been talking about this transition to direct is that our guidance contemplate that there will be some short-term disruption around the transition itself as any transition would be get some disruption and so we typically say that installed base is the best indicator of growth, however, in a transition like this, there's another element to it just related to volumes purchased that could happen when one party exits the market and we enter. And so we're just factoring in that that disruption could occur in a short term around the transition, that really doesn't relate to the installed base. The installed base growth continues to be robust and we're just factoring in that potential short term disruption into the actual guidance for \u201918. Shacey Petrovic : But I did -- I think you're right in the ballpark if we sort of say France isn't going to continue to grow at the outsized rate that it had, you're probably right in the ballpark in terms of the growth of the market. That said, what's really exciting about this move is that once we make this transition, we're going to be able to sort of have a truly global footprint and move into new markets when and how we want and so, as we think about \u201919 and beyond in terms of growth rates for Europe, we'll be looking at entrance to new markets and that we hope to obviously drive continued expansion of growth in that market. David Lewis : This is a much better number underlying than we expected, so I wanted to make sure you were being clear there and you were very clear. And then Shacey, the next question just in the US and I appreciate your commentary in the fourth quarter, but if you think about 2018 and pretty explicit Medicare is not sort of in the plan for 2018, is it really just -- is that realistic even in terms of how you think about the Medicaid business where you already have seen some traction and the same kind of question on Animas for 2018, is that really explicitly in your US forecast? Shacey Petrovic : Yeah. And David, both of those things are explicitly in our US forecast. The Animas and as well as the Medicaid continued expansion in terms of Medicaid. So we feel good about the growth that we're going to deliver despite the fact that a lot of these really exciting potential impacts like DASH and like Medicare and really big Medicaid expansion hit us in 2019. But despite that, 2018 is going to be a great year. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Unidentified Analyst : This is Robbie in for Mike. So I'll give you a break in terms of the new patient adds and I wanted to ask about drug delivery, because I think you\u2019d been consistently saying that you thought it could grow in 2018. So what are you thinking about the trajectory of that line item going forward? And is there any change in profitability as the sales trend off? Shacey Petrovic : Great. And so Robbie I don't think we ever said that we expected the business to grow in 2018. What we've always said is that, we base our guidance and our expectations on Amgen\u2019s forecast in orders. So that\u2019s kind of the end of it in terms of the Neulasta business, which is the vast majority of our drug delivery guidance, but I would say, I think it sort of points to just how successful the business is on the diabetes side, because despite this sort of slight headwind that we have with drug delivery, you see tremendous revenue growth and margin expansion in our diabetes business. It's really exciting to me to see that happen in 2018 and beyond. Michael Levitz : And Robbie, this is Mike. Just as it relates to your question about what Shacey was referring to on the margin piece, so I mean, we are right on target even with the reduced Amgen forecast for gross margin expansion and even positive result in 2018 and I think it's just, we are internally just thrilled with the execution by the operations team and that helps across our business. And so, drug delivery is a much smaller part of our business and so to deliver the operational improvements that we are doing, it just really shows the strength of the overall business for many years to come. Unidentified Analyst : And just a follow-up, as people think about Medicare and Medicaid and they start to add it to their models going forward, there won't be any revenues in 2018, but how do you want people to size the market or are there any metrics you can give us in terms of thinking about revenue per patient, is that something that should be similar to a commercial patient going forward? Patrick Sullivan : Yeah. As it relates to Medicare and Medicaid, I think typically we believe we\u2019ll be similar to the DME rates that are out there for pharmacy Part D coverage, but when you think about the opportunities that there were 450,000 people that are in Medicare and Medicaid, we believe that with this coverage, we\u2019ll be able to take our fair share of that patient population. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Margaret Kaczor with William Blair. Margaret Kaczor : First one from me is a follow-up on some of your commentary regarding those intermediary contracts in Europe. That seemed like it was maybe a higher percentage than what we expected when you referenced that, I think it was JPMorgan conference. What work have you guys done and are these intermediaries maybe secondary distributors that you could look to contract with and really smooth out the process come day one? Shacey Petrovic : Yeah. That's exactly right, Margaret. So that's exactly how we're thinking about it and it is higher than maybe we -- every day, we're learning more about this market and this transition and one of the key elements of the approach we've taken is to reduce complexity and mitigate risk in the transition and so that\u2019s been sort of a rallying cry for the team. And part of the reason why there's a higher percentage of intermediaries is because as we've discovered those opportunities, we have jumped on them to make sure that we reduce complexity and mitigate risk in the transition. So, the last time I think -- the last estimate we were talking about maybe 70% of the business going through intermediaries. Now, it's closer to 80%, 85%. And where we have the opportunity to do that, while also maintaining the flexibility for the long term, we will. So we certainly don't want to ham in our opportunities over the next 2, 3, 10 years in Europe, but where we feel like we can mitigate risk, reduce complexity and not disturb our opportunities long term, we will do that and this is just evidence of that. Michael Levitz : And I would just add, we\u2019re able to maintain the 50% increase in end user pricing even with these intermediaries in the various markets. Margaret Kaczor : And have you guys already approached some of these folks at this point where maybe they're ready or into transition, plus does it change your expense structure. Do you guys try to roll out international? Shacey Petrovic : I'll let Mike comment on the expense structure, but I will just say that we are in conversations with all of these intermediaries across every major market. Michael Levitz : Yeah. And it does not change our, either the revenue guidance or the expense structure from what we've really been saying. Margaret Kaczor : And then just as a second question, different topic. You guys mentioned an exceptions process within Medicare that you guys are trying to pursue before you get on formulary. Have you seen any success stories yet at this point? Or how many of these patients are in guidance? And then in terms of patient attrition related to Medicare, is there any change in gotten on that plan? Shacey Petrovic : Yeah. So good questions and we are -- we have a team of people to support our Medicare beneficiary powders through the exception process. To date, we've gotten somewhere between 50 and 100 customers through the exception process, but just to caution, it's not really a revenue opportunity for us, because we're focused on the customers who today either pay cash out of their pocket or use some sort of secondary insurance and so those are the folks that we are getting through this exception process. So in general, they were probably paying more than we will get reimbursed through this process, however, it is absolutely the right thing to do for our patients and our potters and so we're excited to help support them through this process and we anticipate that we'll get a vast majority or a good portion of our Medicare beneficiary through this process. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Kyle Rose with Canaccord. Kyle Rose : So I wanted to ask a question about on the Horizon project. I mean the IDE data we saw last week was definitely positive. I just wondered if you could remind us what the key milestones are for the next round of IDE trials and then eventually the pivotal trial as we think about the \u201918 and eventually regulatory process in 2019. Shacey Petrovic : Sure. So our third IDE trial is still underway and so that puts us on track for the clinical plan that we mapped out with the FDA. We're learning a lot in this patient population. So as you remember, our goal was to launch with a product that did two things. One was indicated for kids and children because it's such a large component of our patient population and also was simple enough for people coming from multiple daily injections to be able to transition to it. So this IDE focuses on kids down to age two and we are learning a tremendous amount in this patient population. We have kids down to age two in free living conditions and so as we make our way through this data, we're reviewing all of the clinical results and so that will really determine the rest of the clinical pathway before us. So no changes to guidance today. We\u2019re kind of on track to what we originally outlined, but once we've completed this study and analysis, which will happen in the next month or two, I think we\u2019ll determine if any other clinicals are required before we move into pre-pivotals. So everything goes well, we would be in pre-pivotals this year. If we want to add additional studies, it may push it out. Kyle Rose : And then a similar question on the concentrated insulin side. I think you\u2019ve historically given guidance on the, I think, it's U-200 coming to market at some point in 2019 and just as investors start thinking about their models in the out years, how you think about that opportunity, how we should kind of frame initial commercialization there would be very helpful? Shacey Petrovic : Sure. Yeah. We're really excited about these programs obviously. It's been a terrific partnership with Lilly and I think you know this Kyle, but it does double our addressable market and gets us into type 2 in a big way. But just to clarify, the first product that will come to market is U-500. So that's a smaller opportunity, but one of Lilly\u2019s fastest growing molecules and because it's a really significant unmet need, so that will come to market in 2019 and then in 2020 will be in market with U-200, which is the much larger opportunity for us. That gets us access to the vast majority of people living with insulin dependent type 2 diabetes. Michael Levitz : And this is Mike, just a clarification. So because of our recurring revenue model, it's not like when it comes to market, you get a big bolus of revenue. It really just continues to accelerate the growth or the growth curve for our revenue stream. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Ryan Blicker : This is Ryan for Doug. You\u2019ve cited channel mix as a tailwind to the US Omnipod business over the past few quarters, but didn't talk about in your prepared remarks this quarter. Did this benefit you again in Q4 and can you talk about, if so, how material the benefit it was in 2017 and how you're thinking about 2018. Michael Levitz : This is Mike. So, the mix continues to be favorable to us in the US from a pricing standpoint and that's definitely good. It's really not the main part of the story. As you can see by the growth in the installed base, that tracked pretty closely to the growth in revenues. So it is helpful and we expect that trend to continue, but the primary reason for the growth in our US business continues to be the growth in the installed base. Ryan Blicker : And then can you talk about your overall attrition levels today, maybe just provide a little more color, are they consistent with where you've seen historically? I know there are some error bars around that and then maybe provide more color on a question asked earlier about the Medicare process, do you believe that that can help you reduce your attrition in 2018 or is that not really a material impact until 2019. Michael Levitz : This is Mike. I\u2019ll take the attrition question and Shacey, if you want to take the rest. So just as a reminder, we moved to really focus our discussions on customer base, on installed base. I think it was a year or so or more ago and the contributors to the -- in the customer base are the additions for new patients obviously and the reduction of our attrition. One of the challenges that we have is that because of the amount of distributors that we sell through from a channel perspective, you don't have the best data on that side of the business.  So we rely on what we see on the direct business. And as people move between channels, it can look like attrition or not and it could just be moving between channels. So with those caveats aside, we expect that attrition is about the same. It really hasn\u2019t -- it hasn't changed very much. The trend seems to be positive. We continue to make improvements in our product quality, which is one of the elements.  But one of the other biggest elements that drives attrition is access, the cost of the product to patients, meaning their market access and that's where this Medicare decision is so helpful for us because again Medicare and Medicaid are a third of the market that we have not until recently had a pathway to. So we expect that that will absolutely help attrition as we go forward and as we saw on the access side, it's really 2019 that Medicare and broader expansion of Medicaid really kick in. Shacey Petrovic : Yeah. I completely agree with everything that Mike just said. I think we won't see a material impact on attrition this year despite the fact that we've got this exception process, we are really focused on getting the people who are paying cash out of pocket through that exception process and so they haven't technically traded from the product. I do think as we make significant gains in 2019 with Medicare and Medicaid, that has a real potential to solve for some of the access issues that are driving attrition. Patrick Sullivan : And I would just add parenthetically that DASH gives us the opportunity to really hone in on understanding the attrition because we will know where our patients are with certainty. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Jeff Johnson with Baird. Jeff Johnson : Mike, just maybe cleaning up one question from the fourth quarter. OpEx was up 35%, 36%; G&A, up 48%. Was there something one-time in there? I'm just trying to get that to jive with kind of your up 25% OpEx guidance for 2018. Michael Levitz : Well, first of all, there weren't any significant one-time items. Specifically if there are significant ones, I\u2019ll call them out. One of the things to keep in mind relative to our OpEx guidance is we're making a lot of investments for the European infrastructure. Some of that and for US manufacturing for that matter. And some of manned up in G&A as the majority of the European ones are for commercial as you would expect from sales and marketing. So there were incremental investments there and those -- there are some non-recurring expenses that we will see, relative to the European expansion. In my prepared remarks, I described $7 million to $8 million that will happen mostly in the first half of the year. That's factored into our OpEx guidance for next year for \u201818. But apart from that, I don't really expect there to be material non-recurring items. Jeff Johnson : And then just for my second question, obviously some interesting IDE 2 data last week in Vienna, especially that I thought the 50% to basal delivery pre exercise, the improvement just saw there versus maybe taking that target range up to 150 ahead of exercise. There are so many cool things like that you guys seem like you can do with your algorithm. So I guess the question is, how do you balance the -- all these cool things you could do versus trying to make sure you get a product that you could submit for approval, somewhere in 2019, get approval by the end of 2019, early 2020 and Shacey, you kind of alluded to this in your answer to a question a few questions ago about all the different ways you could play with this and maybe do more studies before the pre-pivotals and all that. So just how do you balance the time to market versus the cool stuff? Shacey Petrovic : Yeah. It's a great question, Jeff and it\u2019s honestly one that our team is wrestling with every day. I think you're right, we could -- I think we could drive incredible value here and do a lot of amazing things with this technology. We go back to our mantra, which is our products are all about simplicity and reduction of burden. So if we're adding features or functionality that don't achieve those things, we're not going to compromise time to market for that, however, we would compromise time to market for simplicity and ease of use and so that's really where we're focused on the user interface and making sure that we drive better outcome, but that we do that with a very simple, easiest to use product on the market and that's where a lot of the focus has been, including on our target patient populations. So, we'll do what we've been doing all along, which is review the data in a very detailed fashion, understand the key strengths of the algorithm and then incorporate those as best we can in the first generation. I think we've also seen now from these technologies that you learn a lot once they get onto the market, so we're benefiting from others who are sort of hovering that ground before us and we do want to get to market as soon as we can, so that we can learn even more about our user experience as we get our product out there. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. Raj Denhoy : Couple of questions. One on DASH, I know it's going to be a little limited launch when you do a launch later this year, assuming it gets approval, but how should we think about the revenue contribution from that? Will you be charging for the new PDM? Will there be an upgrade cycle for the patients that wanted, just how should we think about that from a modeling perspective? Shacey Petrovic : I think with any new product and this goes for DASH and every other product that's in our pipeline, I would look at this as an opportunity to accelerate pod volumes and growth in the installed base as opposed to revenue tied to the piece of capital equipment. It's just not our business model and so regardless of what we decide to do in terms of the commercial launch strategy, that piece will never drive a tremendous amount of revenue in a given quarter or a year. Michael Levitz : And this is Mike. Just as it relates to the revenue guidance, so as we said, we've submitted the FDA, we will have a limited launch later this year and given our recurring revenue model, it really is more of a 2019 benefit from DASH. Raj Denhoy : But just to be clear, I mean the 140,000 or so patients I guess I mean globally, will they have to buy a new PDM in order to get all the new functionality of DASH or is it something that they can trade their existing PDM for? Shacey Petrovic : They will have to acquire a DASH PDM in order to get all the benefits from DASH, but we're working on pathways for our customers to be able to access that. Michael Levitz : And particularly, in light of the new Medicare Part D coverage exploring other launch opportunities. Raj Denhoy : And then just one on Medicare, how do you think we should best think about that opportunity. Is the bigger opportunity for you to keep patients that would have otherwise aged into that population or is it -- do you think there's a fertile ground in those existing Medicare patients to actually get them on the Omnipod? What's the bigger opportunity for you? Patrick Sullivan : I think there's two opportunities as those patients who are currently in Medicare that are paying out of pocket to keep those patients. We found that attrition of those turning 65 is a lot higher than attrition in other parts of our customer base. And secondly it's for patients that are 55 and will be on the product for a long period of time. Physicians were reluctant to provide them the Omnipod, because they knew as they would age in the Medicare wouldn't be an opportunity for them. So I think it's in both. And then the spillover effect into Medicaid is tremendous. So, all 450,000 patients or a third of the market that we didn't have access to, we now have access to. That's the big opportunity. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of J.P. McKim with Piper Jaffray. J.P. McKim: I had one on Medicare. I think you called out 8 of the plans gone through, have like 80% of the volumes. So on those 8 or so sponsors, are you guys already covered with them through the pharmacy for their commercial aids, I\u2019m just trying to gauge the risk of them not covering? Shacey Petrovic : Yeah. It\u2019s a good question. It's a little bit of a mix. So we do have coverage on the commercial side with some of those plan sponsors. We are in discussions with all of them and fully anticipate that we will be successful with a number of them. I couldn\u2019t give you a specific guidance on that today, but I think just to understand the process, most of these plan sponsors, if not all of them are going to determine their coverage policies by October. So before probably Q3, we're going to be able to give you really good guidance on how successful we were accessing these Medicare beneficiary life and establishing Omnipod for them. So we'll certainly keep you posted, but we're in discussions with all of them today and we already have commercial coverage with some of them. J.P. McKim: And then one on gross margins, I mean I think you guided 63% to 64% for \u201918. As you ramp to 70%, how should we think about kind of that mix coming from more direct here in the US at your new plan versus just overall volume growth? Is there a good way to frame that up? Michael Levitz : This is Mike. So it really is interesting, the guidance that we gave for the full year, it's almost a tale of two halves for this year, because all of the first half is investment in to second half related to Europe and the second half is the benefit. So the run rate in the second half on gross margin improved by 400 basis points. So, what we're saying -- what I said in my prepared remarks is that we're going to be coming out of the second half in the 64%, 65% range. So as it relates to the target of 70, all of that is before US manufacturing. We definitely expect that the US manufacturing will drive down cost quite nicely. So it's not just about volumes.  When we laid out at our Investor Day the drivers of gross margin expansion, manufacturing improvements and supply chain improvements were the principal drivers and those still remain largely ahead of us. So, the 400 basis point improvement comes from going back in Europe and that's reflected in the 64% to 65% run rate in the second half of this year, but past the 70 is really driven by the combination of US manufacturing, continued manufacturing of supply chain improvements and then volume support on top. But we're making improvements in a number of areas, even as mundane as the ones we've talked about in the past, like freight that may seem small, but we really focus on the pennies and they really add up quickly. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Danielle Antalffy with Leerink Partners. Danielle Antalffy : Shacey, just a question for you as we think about the TAM for Insulet, specifically in the diabetes portion of the business, leaving drug delivery aside, but we're hearing pretty positive commentary about what the artificial pancreas could do to pump penetration and you had also mentioned on a call that we hosted a little while back that the pediatric population has something, the type 1s have something or something like 50% to 60% penetrative for pumps versus 30% to 35% for the national average. So inherently, that would imply that that 30% to 35% number should move higher, albeit minus some attrition as those age. So I am just curious what your view is on the long-term potential pump market penetration in type 1s? And then the second part of this question and how important the artificial pancreas is to get there? And then the second part of my question is for type 2. I was surprised to hear you say on that same call that 13% I think was the number of Omnipod patients are actually to type 2s. What that number could move to once we do have type 2 products on the market? Shacey Petrovic : I think both are really good ones. You're right. When we when about pump penetration today in the United States, somewhere between 30% and 35% of people living with type 1 diabetes use pump therapy and the rates are actually much smaller when you look across the globe in Europe on aggregate, probably closer to 20% for example. So lots of opportunity for the markets to grow. Our data would suggest that that market in the United States is growing somewhere around a 9% CAGR and in Europe, it's growing somewhere around a 5% CAGR. So both areas have markets expanding. And I think the way -- the reason I refer where we are with the pediatric patients is because I think that's where -- if you want to see where this could go, I think the pediatrics are good indicator because people will get more and more familiar and comfortable with these technologies and once you typically adopt pump therapy, it\u2019s highly unlikely that you then revert back to the injections, just because of all the advantages.  So I think over time, this market will continue to accelerate. I think all technologies are helping to drive penetration of pump therapy and that goes from AP to CGM to patch pumps. But clearly Omnipod is a huge contributor there, because 80% of our customers are coming from multiple daily injections. And so we're clearly driving growth in the overall pump market. That's true in the United States without a doubt and it's likely very true in Europe as well although we don't yet have great visibility to that data. That will change obviously as we get our feet on the ground and kind of start to take ownership of that business. The second part of your question, I get really excited about the type 2 insulin dependent population, because it's an area today that manufacturers haven\u2019t paid a lot of attention to for a variety of reasons, but I think that Omnipod has potential to drive tremendous value for that patient population and as we think about our concentrated insulin programs that help us unlock that, what we're doing is really understanding better the needs of that patient population. And we can do that because today we've got 13% and growing of our users that are type 2 and we're doing a tremendous amount of human factors work and research with that patient population to sort of understand what does that user interface need to look like to make it a great experience for them. So I think we're really going to see with the launch of these two products acceleration in those markets and that is -- that opportunity is just as big as the current type 1 opportunity. Operator : Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Patrick Sullivan. Patrick Sullivan : Thank you, operator. I am absolutely thrilled with the performance of the company in 2017, delivering on four very spectacular and significant accomplishments. CMS coverage, the submission of DASH, implementation of our plan to go direct in Europe, breaking ground on a US manufacturing operation and continuing to deliver strong performance. I\u2019d like to thank the Insulet employees for their hard work and commitment to easing the burden and improving the lives of people living with diabetes and other diseases. Thank you for joining us on the call today and we look forward to speaking with you on our first quarter conference call. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Insulet Corporation First Quarter of 2018 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please go ahead. Deborah R. Gordon - Insulet Corp.: Thank you, James. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2018 earnings call. Joining me today are Patrick Sullivan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Shacey Petrovic, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Michael Levitz, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The replay of this call will be archived on our website and our press release discussing our first quarter 2018 results and second quarter and full-year guidance is also available in the IR section of our website. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward looking and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to be materially different from any future results implied by such statement. Such factors include those referenced in our Safe Harbor statement in our first quarter earnings release and in the company's filings with the SEC. Also, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis. With that, I'll turn the call over to Pat. Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: Thanks, Deb, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me on today's call are Mike Levitz, our CFO; and Shacey Petrovic, our President and Chief Operating Officer. After my opening remarks, Mike will provide detail on our first quarter results and increased 2018 guidance. Shacey will then follow with an update on our commercial and R&D developments and milestones. We'll then open the call for questions. I am absolutely thrilled with the company's first quarter performance. Our Q1 results once again exceeded expectations with revenue of nearly $124 million, representing year-over-year growth of 21%. We achieved yet another quarter of impressive gross margin expansion to 61.4%, a 300-basis-point improvement. We entered 2018 with strong momentum and are excited about our continued growth and achieving positive operating income this year for the first time in Insulet's history. In the first quarter, we made significant progress on our four key strategic initiatives, namely, expanding market access, executing on our innovation roadmap, building our U.S. manufacturing facility, and implementing our plan to go direct in Europe on July 1. Since the first of this year, we achieved two significant milestones in expanding market access. In January, CMS issued guidance that Omnipod may now be covered under the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit program. This decision by CMS also provides an easier pathway to secure state Medicaid coverage. And on April 1, we secured in-network coverage of Omnipod with UnitedHealthcare, the largest commercial payer in the United States. These two accomplishments represent a step function expansion of our addressable market, providing a pathway to approximately 40% of the U.S. market or roughly 600,000 individuals who previously had little or no access to Omnipod. We submitted Omnipod DASH to the FDA in January and expect to enter limited market release in the second half of this year. As you know, DASH serves as the platform for our exciting products in our innovation pipeline, including our concentrated insulins and Horizon, our Automated Glucose Control System. In manufacturing, we have made significant progress in building our new state-of-the-art facility in Massachusetts. Later this year, we will install highly automated equipment for assembly of the Omnipod, and we'll begin production in early 2019. This facility will also serve as our global company headquarters. We are making this investment to not only provide redundancy to our existing operations overseas, but importantly, produce Omnipod at a lower cost. This will provide incremental capacity to support our rapid growth and contribute meaningfully toward achieving our 70% gross margin target in 2021. In Europe, we're on track in our transition to direct operations to better serve our fast-growing European customer base and further improve our gross margins. Over the past year, Shacey and I have traveled to Europe to spend time with our rapidly growing team. I am thoroughly impressed with their drive, their passion, and significant diabetes experience. They've made tremendous progress and all systems are go for our transition on July 1. We've been planning this for years, and I'm absolutely confident we will execute a smooth transition. With this transition, we will be in control of our global distribution of Omnipod. And as you know, the size of the international diabetes market is large and expanding. Our transition in Europe is just the beginning of our vision to grow Omnipod adoption around the world. With our strong Q1 performance and outlook for the year, we are confident of achieving our 2021 targets of $1 billion of revenue, 70% gross margins, and above-market profitability. In the meantime, we are focused on our mission to significantly improve the lives and reduce the burden of even more people around the world living with diabetes. We've never been more confident in the bright future ahead, and we still have lots and lots of room to run. I'll now turn the call over to my Mike. Michael? Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: Thank you, Pat. Our first quarter certainly was one of significant progress and I am pleased to walk you through our financial results in the second quarter and increased full-year guidance. Our first quarter revenue growth of 21% exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $2.6 million, and that was driven by strong performance in the United States and International Omnipod based on our growing worldwide customer base and continued momentum across our markets. Specifically, U.S. Omnipod revenue grew 17%, reaching $70.3 million. International Omnipod grew 53%, totaling $38.4 million. And Drug Delivery was approximately $15 million, down $2 million. Our gross margin increased to 61.4%. That's up 300 basis points due primarily to the significant improvements that we have continued to make in our manufacturing and supply chain operations, offset in part by unfavorable mix due to faster growing international distributor sales. This improvement in gross margin is ahead of our expectations for the quarter and we are increasingly confident in reaching our full-year gross margin expansion objectives. Our operating expenses totaled $75.8 million. That's up from $64.7 million and that's in line with our expectation. As a reminder, this does include our investments to assume commercial activities in Europe beginning on July 1. The net result was breakeven operating profit for the quarter, and we are well-positioned, very well-positioned, for achieving our 2018 objective of EBIT positive for the year. We ended the quarter with $516 million (00:08:06) in cash and investments. That's down from the $566 million we had at the end of 2017 and, as a result of capital expenditures in the first quarter, in line with our plan primarily to support our investments in U.S. manufacturing and supply chain operation. The change also reflects $4 million of cash used in operations in the quarter, which was a significant improvement over the first quarter of last year. I will now update you on our 2018 outlook. For the full year, we are raising the low end of our revenue guidance by $5 million, largely associated with our worldwide Omnipod sales. We now expect total company revenue of $565 million to $580 million, and that represents growth of 22% to 25%. On a product line basis, for the U.S. Omnipod, we are raising the low end of our revenue range by $3 million. That reflects our increasing confidence in growth in our customer base given recent market access wins and strong commercial momentum overall. We now expect revenue of $319 million to $323 million, representing growth of 17% to 19%. For International Omnipod, we are also raising the low end of our revenue guidance raising that by $1 million on growing confidence in commercial execution, and we now expect revenue of $186 million to $194 billion. And that represents growth of 56% to 62%. Please note that this exceptional growth includes capturing more value from existing end user pricing in Europe, which is up approximately 50% from our historic distributor pricing as we assume direct operations midyear. For Drug Delivery, we are raising the low end of our revenue guidance by $1 million and now expect revenue of $60 million to $63 million. That represents a decline of 13% to 17% based on the forecast from Amgen. For the second quarter, we expect revenue of $130 million to $134 million. That represents growth of 18% to 22%. On a product line level, we expect U.S. Omnipod revenue of $75.5 million to $77 million, representing growth of 16% to 18%. We expect International Omnipod revenue of $38.5 million to $40 million, representing growth of 45% to 50% and we expect Drug Delivery revenue of $16 million to $17 million, that's down 7%. Now moving to gross margin. We are increasingly confident in reaching our full-year 2018 expectations that gross margin will increase over 300 basis points to between 63% and 64% for the full year, driven by continued operational improvements and a partial year impact of assuming direct European operations midyear. As we stated previously, we expect the assumption of direct European operations will drive a 400-basis-point increase in our run rate gross margin with half of that coming in 2018 based on the midyear transition. Finally, we are tremendously excited to pivot to operating profitability this year, and we are reaffirming our expectation of full-year 2018 operating margins in the low-single-digit percentage range. This reflects the European infrastructure investments that we've made beginning start of this year before we assume direct European sales in the middle of the year. In summary, 2018 is starting out to be another exciting year of tremendous growth and success for Insulet. We are already raising our guidance for top line growth, and we are delivering on our expectations of significant margin expansion and positive operating income for the year. We are increasingly confident about reaching our 2021 revenue and margin target and we are just getting started. We look forward to updating you on our progress as we execute on the exciting growth initiatives before us. I will now turn the call over to Shacey. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Thanks, Mike. I am incredibly proud of our team's continued execution and first quarter accomplishment. Our financial performance is just one of many indicators that 2018 will certainly be another exciting year. Our commercial strategies continue to drive robust revenue and customer base growth. As a result of our strong start to the year, we are reaffirming our expected 2018 full year customer base growth of 15% to 18% in the United States, and we expect to finish towards the high end of our customer base growth guidance in line with revenue. For our international customer base, we expect to grow 20% to 25%. We are making terrific headway on our key commercial initiatives. First, expanding market access for Omnipod; second, preparing for the launch of DASH; and third, standing up our European operations. Starting with market access. CMS's coverage decision and UnitedHealthcare's inclusion of Insulet as an in-network provider for both their commercial and Medicaid members are incredible wins for Insulet and, most importantly, for people with diabetes who are covered by these plans. We have already begun to see the impact of the UnitedHealthcare agreement which went into effect April 1, and this is a great sign for future revenue growth. In addition to pull-through of the UHC access, we are diligently working with all Medicare Part D plan sponsors to secure access so Omnipod will be included in their formulary benefits for 2019. I am very pleased to share the exciting news that two Medicare Part D plan sponsors, Express Scripts and Magellan, have recently added Omnipod as a covered benefit effective April 1 of this year. Securing early access with these carriers is a great leading indicator of our progress to ensure broad availability of Omnipod to all individuals who can benefit from it. On our Medicaid efforts, our strategy to secure widespread coverage is paying off and we continue to establish reimbursement with state plans. Our low upfront cost, CMS's Medicare coverage decision and Omnipod outcomes data are strongly resonating with these plans because they demonstrate a compelling value proposition. This past quarter, we strengthened our Medicaid coverage position, adding approximately 2 million covered lives for Omnipod. While where we are delighted with these early decisions given our recurring revenue model, we continue to expect all Medicare and Medicaid decisions will drive modest revenue this year with the true financial benefit impacting 2019 and beyond. We will continue to update you on our progress as the year unfolds. Turning to our innovation efforts, as Pat noted, earlier this year, we filed a 510(k) with the FDA for clearance of our next-generation product, Omnipod DASH. We are working with the FDA as they progress with their review and we're on track for our planned limited market release in the second half of this year. We are excited to showcase DASH at the American Diabetes Association's Scientific Sessions in June. We received tremendously valuable feedback from our market research and user test groups since debuting DASH at ADA last year. This resulted in notable improvements in product design, functionality and the overall user experience. Omnipod DASH has been developed with significant input from Podders and we're confident it will provide an engaging user interface and significant ease-of-use advantages. This year at ADA, individuals will have an opportunity to experience DASH firsthand, including our Omnipod DISPLAY app, which allows users to see their data on their smartphones, our Omnipod VIEW app, which allows caregivers to view the data of their loved ones, and also our Omnipod dashboards, which allow for quick and easy accessibility of population data for payers. From a clinical perspective, we will have the largest presence at ADA in Insulet's history with 10 clinical abstracts accepted. Several of our presentations will report positive outcomes for our Omnipod Horizon Automated Glucose Control System, examining longer use in free-living settings for users across all age groups. Additional presentations include both U.S. and international data that further supports the benefits of Omnipod, as well as data from our collaboration with Eli Lilly examining the use of U500 with the Omnipod System compared to multiple daily injections in patients with type 2 diabetes. Turning to our Drug Delivery product line, our sales to Amgen for its new Neulasta Onpro kit provide an attractive recurring revenue stream. And as Amgen recently noted, adoption of its Onpro kit exited the first quarter of 2018 at 62% of all U.S. Neulasta doses sold, remarkable adoption since its launch just three short years ago. And finally, we could not be more excited that our transition to direct operations in Europe is just under two months away. This area of our business continues to be our fastest-growing and we anticipate transitioning over 60,000 Omnipod users to Insulet Europe on July 1. We are laser focused on continuity of care and a seamless transition. I am absolutely confident our talented leadership team will successfully execute our thoughtful comprehensive strategy. As Pat noted, our leadership team in Europe frequently spends time there, and our European team, I just spent some time with them last week. I was thoroughly impressed with their deep knowledge of diabetes, the competitive landscape and their state of preparedness as we move towards the July 1 transition date. We have attracted top talent in our industry, and I was struck by the considerable expertise and passion of this group. We have now hired almost 100 people into Insulet Europe, and we have an astounding 1,000 years of diabetes experience on our team. In addition to having our full leadership team in place, this morning, we announced our partnerships with Teleperformance and HealthLink. These European partners will help support local customer care, product support and distribution and logistics services. Both companies have strong histories providing outstanding customer experiences in the medical device space and in the European diabetes community specifically. We also announced distribution agreements with Theras Group and Nordic Infucare, both of which are also highly experienced and well-respected diabetes companies that will provide full service distribution of Omnipod in Italy and in the Nordic markets. With these important partnerships and our European Insulet team in place throughout multiple functional levels and geographies, we believe we have the optimized organization to support our go-to-market strategies for each European country. We have built a strong infrastructure and we are very well positioned for success. I'm pleased with our global team's continued execution and tremendous accomplishments in a short period of time. We are firing on all cylinders and confident in achieving our major milestones throughout the year. Insulet's profile will dramatically change in the second half of this year with the launch of DASH, continued and significant margin growth, and the expansion of our global footprint. These strategic initiatives are setting us up for exciting long-term growth and value creation. With that, operator, let's open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim. Your line is open. Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Hi. Thanks, guys, and congrats on the quarter. I just want to follow up on the European announcements. You've laid out a couple of partnerships in the past week here. Where are you in terms of having the infrastructure in place to handle the crossover to direct? What else should we expect to hear from you in the next couple of months? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Great. Thanks, Chris. Yeah. I think we are in great shape. We now have the infrastructure in place and we're ready to assume that business as of July 1. Where we're still doing some work and executing is on the intermediaries. So, just as a reminder, more than 80% of this business goes through intermediary. Many of these intermediaries work with our current distributor. So, in effect, we'll be sort of getting one middleman out of the scenario. But we do have to go in contract with all of these intermediaries. We're in the process of doing that and fully confident that we'll have that in place. We now have inventory in Europe ready to serve patients as of July 1. Obviously, we made the announcements about our team in place and we're just going to make sure then that all those intermediaries have product to be able to serve patients starting July 1 as well. So that's the work that's underway now. Our plan is really on or ahead of track at this point and we're feeling increasingly confident about that transition. Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Great. And then just one on reimbursement, there's a lot of moving pieces recently with some of the wins you've had. Could you just give us an update on your total covered lives in the U.S. at this point? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: I don't have that number handy. I think that's something we could follow up on. I will tell you we've made a great progress, so when we think about Medicaid, for example, I know we're sitting now just with Medicaid lives at about 10% of the population, around 25 million, 23 million covered lives. I don't have the number specifically for commercial, though. But in general, really broad coverage now particularly with the UnitedHealthcare decision, I mean, that is the largest commercial payer in the market. And as I said, that's already starting to make an impact in our new patient starts and shipments this quarter already this month. Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. Shacey, I wanted to start with the U.S. market. How would you describe market dynamics here sequentially? And then a related question is, as I think of what first quarter performance you delivered right in the middle of the guidance for the year, is it safe to assume as you think about Animas, United, Medicare that you can sort of build on this momentum here in the first quarter over the next couple of quarters? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. Thanks, David. So, in terms of just market dynamics, Q1 is always our softest quarter, and that's just simply due to sort of seasonality in the business. Every year, our deductibles reset in Q1 in the U.S. And so that typically is our latest quarter. That said, it was a very strong quarter year-over-year. And with any of these decisions, as we've said many times, because of the business model, they are really a compounding effect over time. So UHC just went into effect April 1, and we're already starting to see that in new patient starts, so we will expect that benefit to compound for the rest of this year and 2019. I think you mentioned Animas from a competitive dynamics. We do still see people taking advantage of the pathway that we have for Animas users to be able to adopt Omnipod, and we would expect these Medicare, Medicaid and increasing access wins to continue the compound. We think a lot of that impact will come in 2019. But we're obviously guiding to a strong year of 18% growth in the United States in the installed base. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And, Shacey, just on pipeline real quickly, is DASH timeline soft commercial fourth quarter still makes sense and I think you're going to have a Horizon clinical update potentially in the next couple of months here. Any updates on those, and I'll jump back in queue. Thanks so much. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. Yes. So, DASH, we're very excited about that. We're on track. We expect to be moving into limited market release sometime probably mid-summer, late summer, just based on our interactions with the FDA. And we forecasted or planned for a six-month limited market release which would take us to the end of the year. But two things to note about that. One, we're going to \u2013 I think the team is doing a great job planning for this launch, and we're doing all the right things to make sure that we have a successful launch. Obviously, we've learned a lot by watching this market and others launch new technologies into it, and we want to get this one right. So we're going to take the time to do that. But we always have the opportunity to accelerate that. So, if we get in three, four months into it and everything is going to plan, we could certainly move into commercial launch at that point. The last point that I'll make is that any new product launch works differently for us than it does for others in this market, again, because of the business model. So we are not going to have \u2013 it doesn't impact us in that we don't sell a piece of capital equipment right off the bat, right. This is again about the slope of the line and increasing new patient starts. So, if we move the launch up a quarter or move the launch back a quarter, it doesn't materially impact revenue. And then I think you asked about Horizon. We're going to have some great clinical updates at ADA on Horizon, so very excited about that data that I think is really compelling and in free-living settings down to age 2. So really exciting progress there that we'll be sharing with the community on our IDE 3 which is currently underway. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you very much for taking the question. Can you hear me okay? Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: We have you loud and clear. Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Excellent. Thank you. Two questions. The first one is, your gross margins seem to be improving faster than we had expected and even faster than your guidance of 60% to 61% in the first half. What is helping drive that a little bit better or a little bit faster? Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: This is Mike Levitz. So we have, over the last number of years, just continued to improve our oversight in our operations side of our business, and that just continues. We couldn't be more thrilled with the work that our operations team is doing. And so we've talked in the past calls about driving down scrap, driving up product quality, driving efficiency. All of those things are true. So we are \u2013 we have a lot of opportunities ahead of us. At our Investor Day (00:27:50) November of 2016, we laid out what the key drivers are from our gross margin expansion, and that is continue to drive improvements in the operations, which we continue to do and I expect us to continue to do through the year, driving down component pricing and sourcing. We absolutely are doing that and just getting started with that. And the product platform that we have first with DASH and then the other products that introduced after that that we've already described here are all in the same base platform. And that enables us to drive component savings. And then also even mundane things such as the move from air freight to ocean freight, all of those initiatives are really ahead of schedule, on or ahead of schedule, and we expect to drive significant margin expansion in those areas this year. The move, too, that we'll see in the second half, the move to direct in Europe, will drive a run rate 400 basis points improvement in gross margins. So half-year impact of that is about 200 basis points. And then really things are going to improve even further as we deliver on U.S. manufacturing beginning in the \u2013 in the beginning of 2019. That program is doing very well. And so we have a number of initiatives to drive gross margins. We've laid out our multiyear target to 70% and are very confident of that. But in the quarter, there was nothing unusual. It's just continued strong execution. Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: Blocking and tackling. Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I'll continue. So just one or two things going away. My second half of my question is you sound very organized on the international move. What can go wrong? What do you worry about? Thank you. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. It's a great question. I think what we \u2013 what does a flawless execution look like? We would be perfectly ramping down one channel and equally perfectly ramping up another channel. On July 1, every patient and every clinician and every government body would know to call Insulet instead of our current distributor, and we would have perfect supply and awareness throughout the market. And so, obviously, that's the goal, but I think none of us are \u2013 certainly in our guidance, we're assuming that there's going to be some bumps in the road as that plays out. But we're doing everything that we can to drive awareness in the marketplace and make sure that patients, clinicians, government bodies know what's happening as of July 1 and that they know to call us, and then we're certainly reaching out to all of the intermediaries that serve this market. But I think it's just really about awareness and making sure that everybody understands what's happening and that we don't create confusion in the marketplace, and we're working very hard to do that. I would say a lot less is keeping me up now on this program just as we've built such a talented team, so experienced and really understanding what needs to happen and kind of helping us execute successfully on the program. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ravi Misra with Berenberg. Your line is now open. Ravi Misra - Berenberg Capital Markets LLC : Hi. Thank you for taking the questions. Just a couple of questions on the U.S. installed base. You're guiding to that 18% or at the high end of that 18% range that you've given. I'd like to understand some of the dynamics around patient attrition, especially with the Medicare coverage decisions and the analyst conversions. Are you seeing any early benefit from that or, I mean, how is this translating to new patient adds or attrition rates? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. So, in the U.S., attrition has remained fairly steady at about 9%. So I think we've shared that number, and that hasn't materially changed. And really, when we think about these wins around UHC and Medicare, even these early Medicare wins don't go into effect until April 1, and UHC went into effect April 1. And so that's why we say most of the benefit, both in terms of new patient starts, installed base growth, and the potential impact on attrition, is likely to be more of a 2019 and beyond impact. We do know that market access will impact attrition. We know that people trade off the product because they lose access to it. And so, we are very excited that, if we're successful, and we fully expect to be, in implementing coverage with these Medicare Part D plan sponsors, that we should see a nice impact on retention of our patients starting in 2019. Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: As well as new patient starts. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: And new patient starts. Yeah. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: And this is Mike. Just to clarify, one other point is when we talk about our customer base, it really is in many ways because of how much goes through distribution channels and estimate, and it's a backward-looking estimate. And so a lot of these benefits, they may already be contributing, but we won't go to report that out or see that right now. But we are seeing tremendous momentum. Ravi Misra - Berenberg Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thanks. And then, my follow-up question is just around the kind of profitability ramp of the business. You broke even this quarter, kind of still guiding to nice low-single digit operating margin for the year. How should we think about the phasing of that profitability given some of the investments that might be made in the second quarter? I'm assuming perhaps to support the European expansion. Is this going to be kind of like a steady increase in profitability or where \u2013 or is there going to be a little extra investment in 2Q to account for those changes coming in Europe? Thanks. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: No, it's a great question. One of the things that I talked about on our last call is how this is going to impact us, because it's an interesting year. We give full year guidance, but we gave more clarity around first half, second half on the last call because we're making those investments now for ramping up the team. As Shacey described and Pat described, we've built an amazing team. We now have 100 people. But they're coming in \u2013 a lot of those are recent here and are coming and ramping up through the year. So we'll have a run rate of expenses by the time we get through the second quarter without the benefit. The benefit comes beginning really in the third quarter when we have the sales that correspond to it. And so we do expect to see a step change from the first half of the year to the second half of the year. I talked about gross margins going up 400 basis points on a run rate basis, so half year, 200 basis points, for the full year impact. So we do expect there to be a step change as we do this. The guidance that we've provided, we believe, is realistic because this is not a small transition. It is an incredibly meaningful one, a really exciting one. We've made great progress, but as Shacey said, we haven't built our guidance assuming that everything goes perfectly. The good news is that we'll have a really good indicator when we're on the next call how we've gone through the transition. And so we're looking forward to that, but everything right now is looking very good. But we will report out to you as we continue to make progress. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Margaret Kaczor with William Blair. Your line is now open. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. First one for me is on Medicare and just to follow up on Express Scripts and Magellan. Can you give us a sense of what percentage of Medicare patients are covered by those two, whether there are any other steps that you have to go through to start billing for these sponsors or are you already seeing some patient adds for Medicare at this point? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. So, I think, you may remember from last quarter's call that the top eight plan sponsors account for 80% of the population. So I don't have specific numbers that I can provide, but I will say that ESI is one of those top eight. Magellan is not. It's a little bit smaller. So, great win with both of these plans and there is nothing more that we need to do starting April 1 for these patients to access their Medicare benefits through these providers in Omnipod and we have started to ship Medicare patients now. So we're starting to see this benefit pay off, very early days though. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: And I would just add \u2013 this is Mike \u2013 that Medicare is really exciting and meaningful for us. Medicaid is probably a bigger impact for us because of the pediatric population. And so those wins are really \u2013 they really increase in speed after getting the Medicare Part D decision. And so that that again, as Shacey said, is going to benefit us from a new patient start standpoint probably beginning in 2019, but definitely on the revenue side then. So, a lot of exciting things. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. And just to follow up on that discussion. And you guys talked about having new customer adds 15% to 18% and on the higher end of that in the U.S. How much of that is being driven by Medicare, Medicaid and UNH? Is it that 150 bps from the midpoint to the high end, really, what could drive it higher or lower as you go on throughout the year? Thanks. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. Thanks, Margaret. So just to clarify, the 15% to 18% which \u2013 in the United States, we believe, will be 18% is installed base growth. So new patient starts are actually higher than that, but that's just \u2013 that accounts for attrition and the overall installed base growth. And market access wins are clearly contributing to that, so very excited about that progress and so UHC to a greater degree. I wouldn't say at this point Medicare and Medicaid are contributing significantly to that. It's primarily UHC and then just commercial execution, patient awareness, et cetera. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with Leerink Partners. Your line is now open. Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC : Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question and congrats on yet another solid quarter. I wanted to see if we could talk a little bit more about the guidance raise. It seems like you're raising precisely by the Q1 beat, and it just feels like you have a lot of momentum going in the right direction from a top line growth perspective, UNH being one of them. Shacey, I appreciate you saying that the 2019 contribution will be more meaningful. But I have to think that there will be some contribution in 2018. So I just want to make sure I understand why not feel \u2013 why shouldn't we feel better about the rest of the year from an outlook perspective given all that seems to be going your way right now, knock on wood? Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: Danielle, this is Mike. I'll start, then I'm sure Shacey will add additional response to your question. In terms of the guidance specifically, so it's been our practice that, generally speaking, in the first quarter, we really don't change our guidance a whole lot because you give the guidance for the year so close to when you come to the first quarter. And that's been our practice, and we follow that. I think if it's not clear from the statements we've made, I think we need to make it abundantly clear. Things are, look, going very well across the business, and we really are, we're seeing tremendous growth. In the U.S., these wins are incredibly exciting. They're not 2019 wins. They're wins now. But from our recurring revenue stream, we don't get as much of it as some of the other players in the space do because they have a one-time upfront capital. We have it spread over years. In terms of the overall guidance, we have a big transition with Europe coming midyear. And so, our guidance reflects \u2013 there's a wide range of outcomes there. We're going to be able to report back in a very short period of time how that's looking, and it's looking great right now, but you know what, we need to execute on it. So I wouldn't read into the guidance raise anything other than our confidence and it \u2013 we made a similar guidance raise last year in the first quarter and so that's what's reflected in it. Shacey? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. The only \u2013 I'll add two bits of color. So the first is, as I alluded to in the script, is our new patient starts are up significantly this quarter versus a year ago. But as we always say, it's just the business model, right, it's all about installed base growth. That's what will drive our revenue growth in a given year. So we could not be more excited about the momentum and the potential that the United agreement, for example, and these access wins offer, and they're clearly showing in our metrics. But it compounds over time just because of the business model. The other thing I'll say is there was a little bit of noise in the market this quarter because of the United win. Their current distributors that were serving that business are no longer serving that business because we're serving it directly. And so we also saw them just reduce their inventory to account for that change. And that's a little bit of noise or headwind in the market. Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC : Got it. That's actually great color. Thank you so much for that, guys. And one follow-up question, if I could, on the pipeline and your Horizon AP product. Do you guys have any sense, so Dexcom has obviously talked about \u2013 who is your partner in that project, has talked about potentially faster time to market for some CGM products? Does that impact Horizon at all? Have you started having conversations with the FDA on what their new view on CGM could mean for integrated insulin delivery products? Thank you so much. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. Yeah, Danielle, we applaud the agency for finding creative, faster ways to accelerate innovation to the market. It's really exciting what they did with this iCGM designation, and we are participating in these discussions around enabling interoperability with both the agency, Dexcom and others in the industry. So we're definitely a part of those. I think it's a little too soon to share how those might impact our partnership and development programs with Dexcom, but really looking forward to sort of capitalizing on that in any way that we can. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Robbie J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great, and thanks for taking the question. Shacey, maybe one for you. We've had a lot of transition in the market over the past year with J&J exiting the business and 670G really failing to launch last year and into early this year. So maybe you could tell us sort of how you think the market in general has been shaping up and what sort of share you think you have now and where you think the market's growing in the U.S.? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. So, Robbie, I say it every time and I'm not sure that it kind of gets through, but I say it to our team too, we really don't look at other tube pumps as our competitors. And so, these failed launches and/or exits from the market, they've given us a little bit of a tailwind but really not anything of substance. And when we look at where our new patients are coming from, still the vast, vast majority of them are coming from multiple daily injections. There's different estimates on how in the United States the pump market is growing. I hear anywhere from 5% to 7% CAGR anticipated over the next five years and other people who say maybe it's not growing to that degree. All I can comment on is the fact that we are growing and the vast majority of our business is coming from multiple daily injections, and so we're clearly growing the overall market. And it may be that the other players are really taking from an existing base as opposed to growing the market. I think that's the beauty of Omnipod as it really helps people transition from MDI to the benefits of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. Robbie J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And so where do you think most of the J&J patients are going, because it's something like 50,000 in the U.S., 40,000 international? Are they all going to Medtronic or are you able to capture a good portion as well? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: I don't know where they're all going. I can say that, certainly, there are still patients that are taking advantage of our pathway to ensure that Animas patients who want to have the option to use Omnipod. So I think I said it last quarter and the same is true this quarter, typically, anywhere from 80% to 85% of our new users are coming from multiple daily injections. Now, it's closer to 70% to 75%. So that differential is probably the uplift that we're getting from Animas users. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson with Baird. Your line is now open. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Good evening, guys. So just a couple of follow-up or cleanup questions, I guess. But, Shacey, going back to the question on Horizon, you're not yet in pre-pivotals or pivotals. Is there any way to move G6 into that pre-pivotal and pivotal trial? And if not, Horizon will be a PMA product, so would it make sense to think that switching out from G5 to G6 in a whole new iCGM world and what have you and once Horizon has PMA approval, that could be a very fast process? So, even if Horizon comes out with G5 in the end of 2019, it's a three- to six-month path only to get G6 integration. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: So, Jeff, we fully expect to enter into pre-pivotals and pivotals with G6. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: You do. Okay. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: That makes it very simple then. Thank you. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. You're welcome. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: And then one other question just on the international change-out here in July. So I get the customer care and logistics intermediaries, what you announced today. Italy and Nordics was a bit of a surprise to me. I guess, is there a reason those markets needed an actual distributor relationship for you guys? Just trying to figure out why maybe not going fully direct there, and does that have any implications, Mike, on how we think about that up-charge on the price side and all that across your European business? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. So, the great thing about this move is that we were able to get a lot closer to the markets. We were able to sort of design our go-to-market strategy and our organization to suit what we saw as the myriad of opportunities across the market. But they're very different business models in every market, very different in their level of diffuseness in terms of the purchasers and the customer base. And so we just opted to go through distributors in those two markets mainly because we felt like it was our strongest position to serve those markets based on the number of buying points and the number of customer points and support required across them. So, ultimately, we just thought it was the best way to go, and we're excited about those partnerships. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: And this is Mike. I would just add that we've talked in the past about how concentrated our base is. When you look at, I think we've talked about France, Germany, the UK and the Netherlands representing roughly 75% of our base, those places that we aren't going through distributors. The places that are less impactful and it makes sense to \u2013 using distributor makes complete sense. And again, in France, as you may recall, that also \u2013 that goes through what's called the cost of care (00:47:59) as an intermediary as defined by the French market. So that in the core countries where we have the most significant presence, that's where we're going to have our reps calling on customers and on physicians and so on. In terms of the financial impact of this, this has all been contemplated in the guidance that we provided. And so, I reiterated in my comments about the 50% uplift in pricing from our historic distributor pricing. That's all in. That include \u2013 that's \u2013 nothing has changed, and everything that we're seeing is in line with what we've stated for guidance. So absolutely no change. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Lichtman with Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is now open. Steven Lichtman - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Hi, guys. Shacey, I know you've made \u2013 over the last several years, you've made investments in the commercial organization in the U.S. I was wondering specifically this year, are you looking to meaningfully grow the commercial footprint in the U.S.? And if so, about how much do you expect to do so? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: So, Steven, we did grow. In fact, we're done with that expansion now, and there \u2013 I think most, if not all, of the positions are full. We did that at the very beginning of the year, and we grew \u2013 in total, we grew the sales organization which I would characterize both as the external, the field based, and the internal or inside sales team, we grew that by approximately 25% thereabouts. And the internal team focuses on pipeline management sort of getting interested patients through the pipeline. And then the external team is comprised of salespeople and clinicians. And so they support our existing base which obviously is growing, as well as new patient starts. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: And this is Mike. I would just say that we did that expansion because we expected these market access wins. We've made the investment. You've seen in some of our OpEx increase, a good portion of that or within that OpEx increase was an investment in really driving market access. And now we're seeing the fruit of that investment and we need \u2013 we want to have the salespeople to take advantage of the increased demand. Steven Lichtman - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Got it. Thanks. And then, Mike, you reiterated on the OpEx or the operating margin side for the year. Just specifically within that, the stand-up costs for Europe still we should be thinking sort of in the $45 million to $50 million range. Is that fair? Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: Just to be clear as it relates to \u2013 you used the term stand-up costs for Europe. So, when I spoke on the last call, I talked about the run rate costs of the European business meaning, because it's kind of a ramp through the year, I wanted to talk about this new business model of being direct. The run rate cost will be, yes, $45 million to $50 million on an annualized basis. And so, we really have that team in place as we get into the middle of the year. And so you see the run rate of OpEx on an annual basis of $45 million to $50 million. I also talked on last call about some upfront costs, non-recurring costs to stand up the business, and we expect that that would be the non-recurring costs in the year around $10 million is what I guided to last time. There is no change in that guidance. So, everything we guided to relative to the spending is on track and that's what we expect for the year. It wasn't really all that material in the quarter as it relates to non-recurring costs, but we're doing all the things we expected to do, and we're either doing as well or better than we expected to do them. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. Unknown Speaker : Hi, this is Ron (00:51:40) on for Doug. Thanks for taking my questions. Amgen stated on their Q1 earnings call that they're in final preparations to launch the Onpro kit in Europe. Was this already contemplated in their previous forecast to you? Can you remind us how big of a volume opportunity Europe is for Onpro? And do you think your Drug Delivery business will return to growth in 2019? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: So I'll start I guess with those questions and, Mike, you can add any color if you have it. But ultimately, we don't really have insight into what was contemplated or not contemplated in the forecast from Amgen, just really what their forecast is, and our guidance and our raise of guidance is based on Amgen's forecast. And it's sort of the same response in terms of the market opportunity in Europe for Neulasta, Onpro. It really is a question best directed to Amgen. We are working with them to support all of their needs as they enter that new market and certainly excited about the partnership, but we have committed to them to let them comment on their business opportunities. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: And, Doug, (sic) [Ron] this is Mike. We were pleased to raise the guidance on Drug Delivery for this year. In terms of 2019, we just gave 2018 guidance, so I don't want to get ahead of us on 2019. Unknown Speaker : Got it. And then it's been awhile since we've got an update on Drug Delivery outside of Neulasta. Can you give us at least a qualitative update on how the pipeline is progressing? Is the pipeline progressing and do you think any of your partnerships will progress to the point that we hear more about them by the end of 2019? Thank you. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. So, yeah, we continue to have discussions with pharmaceutical partners and some technical feasibility work, et cetera. I think we've said all along we don't expect another Amgen really in the next few years. And obviously, all of these partners are very \u2013 take confidentiality very seriously, and so we can't give a lot of color on that. I will say two things. We still see this as a great opportunity, but as we've continued to say over the last year, year-and-a-half now, it's really a longer-term opportunity, these programs. When we're testing molecules in the \u2013 in many cases, in Phase 1, oftentimes, the molecule doesn't meet its endpoints and/or as we get through technical feasibility, something is uncovered. And so these are just longer-term programs. We see them as a long-term potential benefit. And I think what's really exciting is just to see where we are from a margin expansion standpoint and for a growth standpoint despite that slight headwind that we have because of Amgen's forecast. So we'll certainly keep you posted. Unfortunately, we can't really give a lot more color at this point in those activities. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: From a guidance standpoint \u2013 this is Mike. From a guidance standpoint, when we talk about our 2021 target of $1 billion in revenue, 2021, given the time horizon that Shacey talked about, we never really expected Drug Delivery to play a significant portion in that. So, as we look right now, the nearest term opportunities are within U.S. Omnipod and International Omnipod. And even by 2021, a lot of that's in existing market. So it's really coming out of 2021, what continues to drive significant growth for this business are the expansion into other markets outside the United States for the Omnipod and the opportunities in Drug Delivery. So, when we talk about the $1 billion target going from where we are now, that's largely driven by the U.S. Omnipod and internationally in existing markets, and then the growth beyond that is really the significant opportunity that Pat described and Shacey described. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in. So just a couple of questions. Getting back to the U.S. growth, the quarter-to-quarter move, the seasonality seemed a little bit more pronounced at least relative to the last couple of years. The fourth quarter was obviously quite strong. Was there something exceptional that you saw in the fourth quarter that maybe you didn't see in the first quarter? Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: This is Mike. There always is this this big seasonality piece. And so, no, there really wasn't anything all that extraordinary. Q1 was very strong. It was in line with our expectations. In fact, we beat our expectations. As Shacey mentioned, with the new access wins, there was some ramping down of existing intermediaries. Now we're going to be going direct with UnitedHealthcare as an example, so that did. That was a headwind in the quarter. But by and large, I mean, we always have expected this kind of seasonality. Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Is there any way to quantify the inventory drawdown at the distributor level? Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: I wouldn't call it \u2013 I mean, I guess, maybe you could say around $1 million or something like that. But it's hard to say exactly how much that is, and that's just a natural \u2013 the opportunity before us is significant and that's why we raised our guidance for the year in the U.S. And so the access wins are a much bigger impact than the small ramp-down because we really, with the United side, (00:56:57) we get so much more coverage by being direct than the small piece that we lost from the transition from an intermediary. Operator : Thank you. And actually, we have time for one more question. So we will take the line from Kyle Rose with Canaccord. Your line is now open. Kyle William Rose - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much for squeezing me in here. Just one quick question and then a follow-up. Just I think we understand the dynamic of you using the intermediaries versus you building out the direct infrastructure on a country-by-country basis. But maybe just help us understand how many more of these intermediary contracts should we expect to see before you go live and how many other countries do you think you'll use the intermediary model in? And then, from a longer-term perspective, I mean, does that change the operating profile in the margin expectations internationally given you have less infrastructure to build out? And then, a quick question for Shacey, on the Horizon, any updated thoughts on whether after the third IDE trial, you'll be able to move to pre-pivotal or if there's going to be maybe another IDE trial before that step? Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. I'll take the first piece. Our current distributor in Europe uses intermediaries and/or distributors in a good portion of the market. So, by going direct, we will be interacting with those intermediaries or distributors directly and basically, as Shacey said earlier, removing the middleman that we have today. So when you look at France, as Mike mentioned, that's going through the (00:58:32), there's a number of them, you contract with them individually as well as many of the other markets where you have probably 80% of our business going through Europe. When we are completely up and running, we'll be using either intermediaries or distributors in the marketplace. Not different from what our current distributors does today. The benefit is we're going to get that 50% improvement in our end user pricing and substantial 400 basis points improvement in our gross margins. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. And, Kyle, we don't anticipate any other full distribution partnerships, so we got our team established in the other markets in which we serve outside of Italy and Nordics. All of that is in play. So we'll work through, as Pat said, distribution intermediaries, but we don't expect any full distribution partnerships outside of Theras and Nordic Infucare. The rest of the team is in place and we're ready to go. And then I think your last question was on Horizon. We will give an update as soon as we're done with IDE 3 and reviewing that data. I just don't want to comment too early as I've always said. As we get done with these IDEs, we review the data, we evaluate if we're ready to move into pre-pivotal or into the next stage or if we need to do another study. And because we're \u2013 especially since we're focused on kids, the data looks terrific so far, but I'm going to wait and see it all and then we'll update everybody on kind of our next steps with Horizon. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: And this is Mike. Just to fully answer your question, you had asked about our guidance and what's contemplated from a margin standpoint given the intermediaries. So, in United States, as an example, we go through distributors, but it's our sales force, it's our product support, it's our customer service. So, the infrastructure that you think of the direct business, we're having that same infrastructure in Europe apart from these two markets of Italy and the Nordics. All of what we guided to from an expectation on it being accretive as a business and improvements in gross margin, all of that is \u2013 everything we're doing now is in line with those stated plans and expectation. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session, so I'd like to turn the conference back over to Patrick Sullivan. Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: Thank you, operator. Look, we are absolutely thrilled with our first quarter financial performance and very excited about the significant opportunities before us in 2018. We've made significant progress expanding market access, executing our innovation roadmap, building our U.S. manufacturing facility, and implementing our plan to go direct in Europe on July 1. I'd like to thank the Insulet employees in the United States, Canada, and now Europe for their hard work and commitment to ease the burden and improve the lives of people living with diabetes around the world. Thank you for joining us on the call today. We look forward to speaking to you on our second quarter conference call where we will update you on our successful European transition. Thanks for joining us. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

Also, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis. With that, I'll turn the call over to Pat. Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: Thanks, Deb, and good afternoon, everyone. After my opening remarks, Mike will provide detail on our second quarter results and 2018 guidance. Shacey will then follow this up with this quarter's progress on key milestones, then we'll open the call for questions. We achieved second quarter revenue of $124.3 million, representing year-over-year growth of 13%, with U.S. Omnipod and Drug Delivery revenue exceeding expectations. We achieved another quarter of significant gross margin expansion to 66%, a 710 basis point improvement. We delivered positive operating income of $4.3 million and are on track to achieve positive operating income for the full year for the first time in Insulet's history. International Omnipod revenue was less than anticipated due to excess inventory in Europe when we transitioned from our distributor to direct operations on July 1. The impact of the excess inventory was confined to Q2 and Q3. Q4 will return to normal revenue run rate. When I joined Insulet nearly four years ago, I identified a transition to direct operations in Europe is a significant value inflection opportunity for the company with many benefits, specifically the ability to interact directly with the market, accelerate growth of the installed base, tailor our innovation pipeline to meet needs of the European market, expand our direct operations in other international markets, realized a 50% increase in our average European pricing and improve our gross margin by 400 basis points on an annual basis. Exiting this year, we will be in control of an international business of greater than $200 million in revenue with a lots and lots of room to grow. Going direct in Europe was a lot of work and a very big deal. On July 1, after two years of planning and one year of building our presence in Europe, we successfully met this very important objective. We are fully staffed with over 100 people on the ground and we've met all of our operational milestones leading up to and through the transition. We maintained 100% continuity of care for all Omnipod users across Europe, which of course was our number one priority. Since the stroke of midnight on July 1, our 24/7 customer care, distribution and logistics teams in Europe have been supporting customers, taking orders and shipping product across the continent. Our commercial teams have been calling on customers and onboarding new patients and these efforts are already having a very positive impact. For the month of July, international new patient starts and shipments were strong. In fact, new patient starts in our direct markets were notably higher than the historical run rate. Intermediaries within all of our markets have placed orders, reflecting strong end-user demand for Omnipod in a vibrant business. We are extremely confident in the strength of our European business based upon the valuable market insights we are gaining through our direct interactions with our European customers. I'd like to now provide you an update on some of our other key strategic initiatives. On our innovation roadmap, we achieved a second major milestone for the company this quarter. On June 5, we announced the FDA clearance of our Omnipod DASH System. DASH serves as the foundation of all exciting innovation pipeline, including concentrated insulins in HORIZON. DASH was a big hit at the American Diabetes Association meeting in June and we just entered limited market release last month. Turning to market access, we secured early access with two Medicare Part D Plan Sponsors : Express Scripts and Magellan, both of whom added Omnipod as a covered benefit at the start of the second quarter. These early wins are a great indicator that we will have broad coverage in 2019. We are also making great progress securing Medicare reimbursement with state plans. Based on the progress we're making with Medicare Part D sponsors and the early win with UnitedHealthcare, our U.S. new patient starts for the second quarter were the highest in the company's history. In manufacturing, we're making great strides in building our new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility and company headquarters in Massachusetts. We're on track to install our automated assembly equipment later this year and expect to begin production in early 2019. This facility will provide redundancy to our existing operations overseas, as well as additional capacity to support our rapid growth. Manufacturing in this facility will contribute to achieving our gross margin target of 70% in 2021. Before I hand the call over to Mike and Shacey, I'd like to reiterate that despite the single speed bump in Europe, the transition to direct operations last month was a tremendous success and business throughout Europe is strong. We are pleased with the growth of our Omnipod business and we are well on our way to achieve our 2021 goals of $1 billion in revenue, 70% gross margin and above-market profitability. With that, I'll turn it over to Mike. Michael? Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: Thank you, Pat. Our financial performance in the second quarter demonstrated double-digit revenue growth even after the higher than expected unfavorable impact of channel inventory as we transitioned from our former distributor in Europe. Our gross margins rose significantly, reaching 66% and we moved to positive EBIT this quarter. As a result, I am pleased to confirm that we are on track to achieve our target of full-year positive operating profit for the first time in Insulet's history. The fundamentals of our business are very strong and we will deliver significant growth throughout 2018, setting us up well for a great year of top and bottom-line growth in 2019. We are highly confident in achieving our long-term projections for both growth and profitability. Diving into the results. Total company revenue grew 13%, led by high growth in the United States, which was above the upper end of our guidance range, offset by lower than expected international revenue. In the U.S., we had another high growth quarter with Omnipod revenue up 19%, reaching $78.1 million due to our fast-growing customer base and early momentum from recent market access wins. Our International Omnipod grew 7%, totaling $28.5 million. The results were approximately $11 million lower than the midpoint of our guidance due to channel inventory in Europe, including a reduction in revenue of $7.4 million in the quarter for the repurchase of inventory from our former European distributor. Apart from the near-term impact of this channel inventory, our underlying business in Europe is very healthy with great momentum. And our Drug Delivery product line revenue was $17.7 million. That's roughly in line with last year. Turning to gross margin. This quarter, we continued to drive significant gross margin expansion reaching 66%, up 710 basis points. This was due to continued tremendous improvements in our manufacturing and supply chain operations, as well as favorable mix in the quarter on lower international distributor sales. As a result of the operational improvements and our successful transition to direct operations in Europe, which adds 400 basis points to our historic gross margin run rate, we now view 65% as our new base. We are, therefore, raising our full year 2018 expectations to 65%, a year-over-year increase of over 500 basis points. I'm also pleased to say that we are on track to achieve our longer term gross margin expansion objective of 70% in 2021. Moving down to P&L, our operating expenses totaled $77.7 million, up from $68 million, in line with our expectation. This included spending in Europe in line with our expected annual run rate of $45 million to $50 million. As a result of our revenue growth and gross margin expansion in the quarter, we delivered positive operating profit of $4.3 million. We ended the quarter with $456 million in cash and investments. That's down from $566 million at the end of last year due primarily to capital expenditures as we invest in U.S. manufacturing and supply chain operations in line with our plan. I will now update you on our 2018 outlook. For the full year, we expect total company revenue in the range of $547 million to $562 million. That's representing growth of 18% to 21%. This is compared to our previous expectation of $565 million to $580 million. On our product line level, we are raising the midpoint of our revenue guidance ranges for both our U.S. Omnipod and Drug Delivery product line and we are lowering our revenue expectations for International Omnipod due to the short-term impact of channel inventory in Europe. For U.S. Omnipod, we now expect a range of $320 million to $323 million, representing growth of 18% to 19%. This increase reflects our high confidence in the growth of our customer base, given recent market access wins and strong commercial momentum overall. For Drug Delivery, we are raising our expectations to a range of $64 million to $66 million. That represents decline of 9% to 11%. And for International Omnipod, we are revising our 2018 guidance range to $163 million to $173 million, representing growth of 36% to 44%, down from our previous expectation of $186 million to $194 million. This growth estimate reflects an uplift of approximately 50% from our historic distributor pricing in Europe, now that we are direct, offset in part by our inventory repurchase from our former distributor and the mid-year transition-related channel inventory. For the third quarter, we expect total company revenue of $144.5 million to $151.5 million. That's representing growth of 19% to 24%. This includes U.S. Omnipod of $82 million to $83 million, representing growth of 17% to 18%, International Omnipod of $45 million to $50 million, representing growth of 39% to 54%; and Drug Delivery of $17.5 million to $18.5 million, down 4% to 9%. You will notice the range we are providing for International Omnipod is a bit wider than usual and we encourage you to model closer to the midpoint of the range due to the near-term impact of channel inventory in Europe. Finally, we're excited to deliver operating profitability this year and we are reaffirming our expectation of full year 2018 operating margin in the low-single-digit percentage range. In summary, 2018 is on track to be another year of high growth and successful execution for Insulet. We continue to drive strong top line growth as well as significant gross margin expansion and positive operating income for the year. We also continue to deliver truly exceptional execution in all areas of our business and are highly confident about reaching our 2021 revenue and margin targets. We really are just getting started. I will now turn the call over to Shacey. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Thanks Mike. Across our business, our team continues to execute, achieve significant milestones and make great progress on our key strategic imperatives. Our Q2 international revenue results did not meet our expectations. However, like Pat and Mike, I am confident we have identified the source, have effectively solved for it and that the impact is short-term. I will start off with a brief overview of our customer base expectations. For U.S. Omnipod, we now expect a range of 18% to 20% customer base growth. For our international customer base, we are reaffirming expected growth of 20% to 25% and expect to be at the midpoint of this range. Despite the short-term inventory impact, our underlying European business is incredibly strong. Shortly, I'll share some great progress we've made and key learnings since our transition. First, I would like to expand upon what Pat discussed in his remarks. While we made every effort to ascertain how much inventory was at our distributor and in the European channel during the transition, as we advanced contract negotiations with our intermediaries, it became evident there was excess inventory in the field. Also, in June, our former distributor disclosed to us that its previous inventory reporting was inaccurate and understated. We decided to buy the excess inventory back from our former distributor in order to reduce confusion in the market and contain the financial impact. Our desire for better visibility into the European market was a prime reason for assuming all commercial operations in Europe. We are incredibly excited about the fundamental strength of our European business and the team's execution of this transition. And now that we have our own team in place running the business, we are much closer to our customers to better serve the market and grow the business much more effectively. Early indications have confirmed our view that there is tremendous opportunity for further penetration into our existing European markets to grow further across Europe and to expand into other global markets. We have had this business for just over 30 days and in that short period our fully staffed commercial team is gathering market insights, educating clinicians, negotiating with payors and training patients. We are providing clinician support and 24/7 product support in five languages. We have shipped to every market we serve, including our distributors, and every intermediary we are contracted with and to thousands of patients across our direct markets. We've established strong relationships with key opinion leaders and our EU regulatory bodies. And recently we announced our partnership with the International Diabetes Federation to support advocacy for improved diabetes care across Europe. Our European field team has already onboarded hundreds of new patients across all of our direct markets, a testament to the deep experience and great execution of our talented sales and clinical teams. I had the pleasure to be in our London office as well as in Lisbon with our Customer Care team during our official Insulet European kick off. The excitement and energy were contagious and I continue to be impressed by the passion and expertise of our team. I have no doubt we have the right team in place to drive tremendous long-term value. We have built a powerful infrastructure to support our significant growth trajectory and to drive success. And I look forward to sharing our accomplishments with you as the year progresses. Additionally, although our Canadian operations represent a smaller percentage of our international business, I would be remiss if I didn't mention just how well our team is executing to deliver strong commercial results and grow this area of our business. We are very pleased to have been selected as the preferred insulin pump for individuals with diabetes in the province of British Columbia. Now, an individual who meets the eligibility criteria will receive coverage for Omnipod. The province also eliminated the age restriction of 25 years or below and extended pump therapy reimbursement as a lifetime benefit for patients. We are ready and look forward to serving these patients that have been waiting for this change. This is yet another success story that supports the many benefits of Omnipod and the global acceptance and adoption of our differentiated technology. Moving on to our market access efforts, in the United States, we continue to make terrific headway. As Pat mentioned, our recent UnitedHealthcare, Express Scripts and Magellan wins have strengthened our outlook and long-term growth trajectory. They also represent important wins for the current and future Omnipod users covered by these plans. We are already realizing the positive impact from the UnitedHealthcare coverage that went into effect on April 1, and we expect this momentum to accelerate into 2019. We are also working closely with the Medicare Part D Plan Sponsors so that Omnipod will be included on their formulary benefits for 2019 and we will have greater insight on our Q3 call about Medicare coverage and timing. And this past quarter, we further strengthened our Medicaid coverage position by adding 4.5 million covered lives for Omnipod, bringing our total to approximately 30 million Medicaid covered lives. While we've made great headway here, we expect Medicaid access to continue to grow throughout this year and into 2019. Moving on to our innovation efforts, we are thrilled to have received FDA clearance for DASH in June. We had a great unveiling at ADA where DASH was very well received and the feedback from healthcare providers was overwhelmingly positive. At our booth, individuals had a hands-on experience with DASH and our Omnipod DISPLAY and Omnipod VIEW mobile apps were a big hit. As a reminder, the DISPLAY app allows users to see data on their smartphones, while the VIEW app allows caregivers to remotely view the data of their loved ones. Customer response was incredibly enthusiastic, particularly for the new features enabled by DASH's Bluetooth communication, such as the ability for a user to have an integrated view of their Dexcom CGM and Omnipod data on their iPhone. In addition, we had our largest clinical presence to date at ADA with nine presentations, including Omnipod use in Germany and Austria, our U-500, Omnipod data with Lilly and Omnipod Horizon Automated Glucose Control System data. For the second year in a row, our Omnipod Horizon data was highlighted by ADA for its overall excellence. We continue to make development progress on Horizon and are in the second half of our third IDE clinical development study, learning a lot about the system performance in two- to six-year olds in free-living conditions. We expect this study will wrap up in September and we will either head into a pre-pivotal or into a final IDE. Last month, we entered into the limited market release for DASH. We now have our first round of new users on DASH and are receiving great feedback on the performance of the system. Customers are highlighting the intuitive touch screen interface of the system and its unparalleled ease of use. We will scale usage and work to establish market access for DASH over the next two quarters and expect to move into full market release in early 2019. DASH is not just an exciting new technology platform, but also a unique opportunity for us to improve the customer experience through the pharmacy. A percentage of our business goes through this channel today and it provides a faster turnaround, reduced documentation burden for both clinics and patients and the potential for better patient economics and more convenience. Thanks to CMS's Part D designation, Omnipod is very well positioned for the pharmacy channel. By removing the upfront cost of the PDM and focusing our Market Access team on pharmacy during the limited market release, we will increase DASH access in this channel. Launching with a no-cost PDM and potential for pharmacy access with just an e-prescription significantly reduces barriers for adoption of Omnipod and is designed to enable more people to benefit from our remarkable technology. Payors are responding well to this pay-as-you-go business model. And in just a few short weeks, we have secured meaningful coverage for DASH. In summary, we are pleased to have moved through a largely successful transition of our European operations this quarter and are proceeding full steam ahead with capturing the newly expanded opportunities in our international business. We continue to make tremendous progress advancing our innovation pipeline and market access efforts. I have great confidence in Insulet's ability to achieve long-term growth and value creation. With that, operator, let's open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question from the line of David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. Guys, I'm going to blow my two questions here on the ex-U.S. business. So, Shacey, I think your description of what's happened ex-U.S. I think it's pretty clear, I think, but people want to get a better sense of. As you can get through this inventory burden, can you or Mike size the state of the burden and what your confidence is that you can get back there by the fourth quarter? And I had a quick follow-up as well on ex-U.S. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Okay. Sure. Yeah. So we estimate that there are approximately seven to eight weeks of inventory in the channel, which is spread over Q2 and Q3. That's about four to five weeks in Q2 and approximately two to three weeks in Q3. And so, that was about an $11 million impact in Q2 and we expect also an $11 million impact in Q3. In terms of how confident we are in those numbers, we are very confident in those numbers. I think over the last 30 days we're seeing exactly why we took this business over. We're getting just a different level of insight into the market. We have now interacted with all of our intermediaries, all of our patients and clinicians and we just have been able to validate customer base information, utilization rates all of this insight. So we feel very confident that by Q4 we're back to our normalized run rate. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, my follow-up then for Mike. And Mike, I apologize if I'm doing the math wrong in your guidance implied. But it feels like the ex-U.S. guidance range in the third quarter and the fourth quarter are pretty similar. And just given what Shacey said about the drawdown in the second and third, I would expect somewhat of a bigger recovery in the fourth quarter, ex-U.S., if the demand signals were there. Am I doing the math wrong? And maybe you can just help us understand how third and fourth can be sort of flattish if you work through the inventory and do better in the fourth? Thanks so much. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: Sure. So, just to clarify, so the fourth quarter is definitely higher than the third. I think if you're referring to being flat, the range is a $5 million range for the third quarter and implies a $5 million range for the fourth. But we definitely see there being higher growth in the fourth quarter and the high end of the range more reflective of the underlying business. I think it's fair to say, as I mentioned previously, that we have given a wider range in the third quarter because we do expect to work through the remaining excess inventory in the third quarter. Generally speaking, at this time of year, we would have a wider range in the fourth quarter than we would give when we finish the Q3 call. So there's \u2013 I wouldn't read anything into the wider range on the fourth quarter. I think it's fair to say this is not a small transition. And given the quarter we just completed, we just want to be very thoughtful in the guidance. I think what's important to note is what the fourth quarter guidance implies is a north of $50 million a quarter run rate, $200 million-plus international business. And that's what we were trying to convey with the guidance is really just that we do see this being a very strong business, in line with our expectation. Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: And higher profitability. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks, Pat. So definitely a higher probability. So the last quick follow-up there was, can you just give us a general sense of when you say fourth quarter full recovery, do you think the fourth quarter then reflects the rate of growth, for example, we could expect into 2019 or should we still expect acceleration from that level as you move into 2019? And I'll jump back in queue. Thanks so much. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: I would expect acceleration from the Q4 level. What's so exciting about this is now we've got 115 people in Europe. Our commercial organization is exclusively focused on Omnipod. So I think our guidance is broad, as Mike noted, because of the transition and just the noise in the year. But as we continue through Q4 and then looking beyond, we expect the business to continue to grow at an accelerated rate from Q4. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Misra of Berenberg Capital. Your line is now open. Ravi Misra - Berenberg Capital Markets LLC : Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the questions. Can you hear me? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. Ravi Misra - Berenberg Capital Markets LLC : Hi. Great. So just wanted to push back the first question on the gross margin. If you could help us understand on that 700 basis points, how much of that was kind of tied to mix shift and how much of that was the underlying kind of improvement in the business? And then, my follow-up is around that \u2013 again, the international business. How should we think about kind of new patients versus churn? I mean, it seems like you have more control over the channel there now going direct. But is there some sort of turnover that we should be kind of factoring into our forecasts when we look at the patient adds there? Thank you. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: This is Mike. I'll take the gross margin question and... Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: ... then I'll turn it over to Shacey. In terms of the breakdown of the significant improvement we had in the second quarter, approximately 3 points of that was the favorable mix with a much lower international business. What's implied and what I described in my earlier comments is we do expect that we have now reached a threshold where 65% is now our base. And so, while we were helped in the quarter by the favorable mix, as we go and looking forward at the trend, we now are direct in Europe, we now are realizing the 50% uplift in pricing, not to end users but our capturing of what was instead going to our intermediary. And so, that's why we believe that 65% is what we expect for the remainder of the year and as our base. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: And, Ravi, to your question about new patients and churn, actually, the attrition rate in Europe is much lower than it is in the U.S. So it's approximately 3% to 4%. And we have no indication that that has increased with this transition. In fact, we are very confident that we've transitioned approximately 60,000 patients, and that \u2013 as Pat said, that we provided 100% of continuity of care for the patients in this transition. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Margaret Kaczor of William Blair. Your line is now open. Anna Nussbaum - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. This is Anna in for Margaret. And I just wanted to transition to DASH a little bit and just ask what your initial feedback from patients is on DASH and from payors and what kind of data do you need or hurdles do you have to push those reimbursement contracts with the pharmacies? Thanks. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. Thanks, Anna, for the question. So the feedback so far has been terrific. It's really been designed as a consumer device, but one piece of feedback that we got from one of the users, which I thought was great, is that it took her 4 minutes to kind of learn the system and prime a POD, which is pretty extraordinary and just goes to how intuitive the system is and that it was designed like a cell phone as on a cell phone platform. And so, people are really impressed with just the easy-to-use platform. In terms of payors, it's not really a data issue. We're getting a lot of great feedback from payors as we work to establish DASH pricing, which is primarily in the pharmacy channel. It's been tied to the change in the business model. So this is eliminating the PDM pricing and then moving forward kind of moving that into the PODD pricing. And so that's been the change that's been occurring and payors are responding very well to it. It's just a sort of further enhancing the advantage that Omnipod already has over these other systems where payors are plunking down a ton of money and then keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that people stay on the product and get the benefit. So we've just eliminated that hurdle for payors and that has been very positively received by the payors that we are currently in discussions with. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson of Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. So let me start first I guess on international. I'm sure we're all going to have some questions. But, Mike, I just want to push a little harder on that fourth quarter number. Even around $50 million, I think you talked about in the fourth quarter and I know there's a range there, but that's somewhere in the neighborhood of 30%, 35% year-over-year growth. With the 50% price uplift, it seems like simple math would suggest there's been a reduction in the core revenue ex the price list. Am I missing something there? Can you just help me kind of connect all those dots, please? Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: Sure absolutely. So what I guided to for the third quarter is $45 million to $50 million. And given the range for the full year, that would imply that the fourth quarter is between $51 million and $56 million. So probably above $50 million as I described. So what we've built in there is a wider range, as I said, than you would on a one-quarter basis, but again we're only halfway through the year. So if you look at the upper end of our range, which we believe is more indicative of the underlying business for the fourth quarter, there really isn't a change in direction. If you talk about 50% uplift in pricing, this is north of that. And as we said, our initial focus is on continuity of care and we've also said that new patient starts, generally speaking, are not a big driver in any given quarter of our revenue and it really changes the slope of the line. So we have an excellent team in Europe. They have hit the ground running and the trajectory is strong. And so, you shouldn't infer anything other than that from this guidance. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: All right. That's helpful. And I was doing some math during the call. So I apologize, Shacey if I missed this, but did you give any update on Horizon pre-pivotal or pivotal timing and just kind of launch expectations? If I missed it, I'm sorry. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: No, that's okay. So what I said was that we expect to wrap up this IDE in September. We'll then take that data and share that with the FDA and then make a decision whether or not we move into either a final IDE or into pre-pivotal. So we'll have that clarity on the next call for certain. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Expectations, if you had to put them right now for when Horizon might see in the U.S. a launch, any updated thoughts there? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah, I think if we head into pre-pivotal, there is still a path for end of 2019, early 2020. If not, it may add a few months to the timeframe and we'll be able to give a lot more clarity on our next call for that one. We have been meeting with the FDA. We've been discussing the iCGM pathway with the FDA and with Dexcom, which also is a factor that could be a tailwind for that. So we just want to get all of those questions answered before we give any further guidance to all of you guys. But that should all be done by the next call. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Understood. Thank you. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy of Leerink Partners. Your line is now open. Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Shacey, I'm going to ask a high level question. I was wondering if you could comment on the diabetes device market overall. It felt like at ADA, there was a lot of excitement around diabetes devices, not just PDM, but also insulin pump and it's a drastic difference or change from ADA 10 years ago. And I'm asking the question because you've now seen several reports this quarter. Dexcom yesterday on the CGM site (00:35:26) your U.S. numbers are very strong. Do you feel like we're at an inflection point for diabetes devices overall? And what that could mean for pump penetration? Where you think pump penetration is today? Where it could go over the next year few years? How quickly it could ramp? Thanks so much. Sorry, I know that was a lot. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: No problem, Danielle. Yeah, so I agree that there's been a tremendous sort of buzz and two things at least are driving that. I think the first is CGM adoption. So as I've always said, for us CGM adoption is a great thing because as people get more visibility to their glucose trends, they typically want tools to help them control that and Omnipod is a great tool for that. So obviously, as we see more CGM adoption, we also see more Omnipod adoption. The other thing that's driving that really is the FDA's responsiveness to both the patient communities, to industry and to the clinical communities that are really driving interoperability and these Automated Glucose Control Systems to market by giving pathways like the iCGM and iPump pathways. So I think all of that really bodes well and we applaud the FDA's innovation on that front. And I think that we already were predicting that the pump market could grow at a CAGR of somewhere around 8% to 9% over the next five years. I think you can see that increase as a result of really these terrific trends with CGM. And you know what; it's actually showing in our numbers too. Pat referenced the fact that this quarter we had a record new patients start record growth rate as well. And so, certainly we're seeing that tailwind and momentum in our business. Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Great. And just one quick follow-up as we shift to the type 2 opportunity, and I think you guys have said in the past that around 13% of your existing installed base is type 2. Correct me if I'm wrong there. But have you guys come up with a type 2 go-to-market strategy? I think we're relatively close to the first product launch, if I'm remembering correctly. So any color there and how that could be additive to numbers in 2019 and beyond? Thanks so much. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. Yeah. So I think you're right, Danielle, about 13% of our U.S. business is type 2. And, frankly, we believe we have the best type 2 pump available today because of its ease of use and certain features that are really well received by the type 2 community. And then, of course, things like improvements in user interfaces that are geared towards the type 2 patient, which come with our U-500 and U-200 products with Lilly, will also help accelerate that. And so, I believe that we're going to see growth in that segment of our population over the next few years as those products come to market. And in fact, the growth in that segment has kept up with the growth in the rest of the segment. So we're seeing that continue to grow, which is great. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good afternoon, everybody. Two questions. We haven't spent any time on drug delivery. Could you give us an update on what you're seeing there? And if you'd like to comment on any contract negotiations or anything that would be awesome. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. I'll give you an update. Obviously, the partnership with Amgen remains strong and we were really excited to see their reporting that the on-body injector now represents 63% of all U.S. Neulasta doses. So just really strong adoption there. There's nothing really new to report on the drug delivery front. We continue discussions and exploratory work and as we have always said, that remains confidential. And so much of what we're discussing is really early stage in nature. And so, as we think about our 2021 goals, for example, what we've always said is that we don't really need another Amgen to achieve those. We see this really as a much longer term contributor. Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you. And as a follow-up question, it seems to me that \u2013 as a follow-up to Danielle and your commentary that we're in that trifecta area where you have the FDA working, new products being approved, but also the reimbursement side. And can you just give us an update, a little bit on UnitedHealthcare and possibly any other insurers that you may be talking with? Thank you. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. So the growth associated with the UnitedHealthcare access has been extraordinary. It's really helping to drive new patient adoption and that took us to a great level in terms of commercial reimbursement for Omnipod. So we have virtually 94% or 95% of commercially covered lives that have access to Omnipod now, which is a great place to be. And I think you're right. In addition to the FDA propelling innovation, it's great to see payors really making these innovations available to their patients. And so, that's so true. Because we have broad commercial coverage, our focus has really started to be in the pharmacy channel in terms of expanding coverage for DASH there. We see that as a great opportunity to provide competitive differentiation, a better customer experience, and for us a lower cost channel to serve. So that's where we're focused really over the next six months. And then, of course, on the pull through for Medicaid and Medicare and that is all going very well as well. Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale of Guggenheim. Your line is now open. Christopher Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thanks. The increase in your U.S. installed base growth expectation is certainly very encouraging, especially since we've yet to see the full impact from DASH and some of the more recent market access wins. Just talk about the dynamics there and what's going better than you might have expected at the start of the year? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. Really that increase in installed base is driven primarily by the market access wins. So United went into effect April 1. That has certainly propelled new patient starts and then we have some early Medicare wins as well. And I think we're also benefiting from just more awareness and then reduction of barriers in physicians' offices. There were physicians who may have had good commercial coverage, but without Medicare or Medicaid, they were less willing to offer the product. But now that we have those things either there or thereabouts, much more willing to offer the product more broadly to their patient population. So that's been really working in our favor. We did have a little bit of mix working against us quarter in the U.S. business. And so, that sort of is why the revenue base doesn't line right up with the installed base growth. But I think that's all good because it's coming from an increase in market access, which will really drive volume growth and revenue growth as we look out over the horizon. Christopher Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thanks. And then just one on the European business. The third quarter guidance, does that assume additional inventory repurchases or is that piece done and the $11 million impact in 3Q is really just slower underlying business trends as you absorb that excess channel inventory? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Right. So the repurchase is done. What is implied in the Q3 growth is just the inventory that was existing within our intermediaries that our former distributor had sold into in excess before the transition. So we'll work through that in Q3 and be back to the normalized run rate in Q4. Christopher Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Robert J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just to follow up on Chris' question. After there was a quarter couple of years ago where inventory built up in the channel in Europe. I know you guys put in really good controls. What happened that you didn't know how much inventory was in the channel and when did you realize that occurred? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure, Robbie. So if you think about what this is, so seven to eight weeks of inventory. It's probably likely that it was built over some extended period of time. So to put it in perspective, it's about a day a week for every week last year of excess inventory. And the reason why we perhaps did not eliminate all of that activity was because the business was growing so quickly. So it's rapid growth. We had France exploding and we wanted to make sure that no customer went without product. And so, it's not really an exact science. We had great oversights in place. We didn't ship, actually, all orders to our former distributor in both Q1 and Q2. So we had great oversight for the last six months. But I think ultimately because of how fast growing the market was, we had this a little bit of excess. I think the good news is the team reacted very quickly. We mitigated it and contained it to Q2 and Q3 and ultimately, the underlying business is very, very strong. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. This is Mike. I would just remind what Shacey mentioned earlier, which is in June was when we had been informed by our former distributor that the information they'd given us before on inventories was inaccurate. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: So in answer to your question about the timing. Robert J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. And then, just two very quick follow-ups. One, do you know at this point what the size of the payment you'll owe to Ypsomed is? They've been saying somewhere in the $50 million ballpark. And can you remind us of the timeframe for the U-200 product? Thanks. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: Robbie, it's Mike. I'll take the fee payment. So we'll determine the fee. As a reminder, the fee is based upon shipments that occur over the next 12 months. It's defined very, very specifically in the agreement. And depending upon the information that we find in \u2013 as we kind of get into the details on the customer definition and whatnot, it can lead to a somewhat wide range. And we've disclosed in our SEC documents historically a pretty wide range, as low as $10 million, as high as $50 million. It's not necessarily reflective of \u2013 the business is reflective of really the customer as defined in the agreement. And so, that will become clearer as we go forward. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: And U-200, we expect that to be in the market sometime towards the end of 2020 or 2021. So that's currently in development and making good progress. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of J. P. McKim of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. J. P. McKim - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to go back on the international piece where I think there's like two to three weeks here in Q3 and maybe I misunderstood it, but aren't we past two to three weeks here in Q3 already? And if so, does that mean you've worked through all the inventory and you have pretty good visibility into that? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Well, I'll say that July has been very strong. So we do feel optimistic that we're getting this in the rear-view mirror, but we're also sensitive to the fact that we've only had the business for 30 days. And we've been able to validate customer base, inventory levels, et cetera, with about 75% to 80% of our intermediaries. So we're just being cautious in terms of the rest of the area that we haven't quite validated. Maybe that some of these smaller intermediaries, for example, have inventory that we're not yet aware of. But I think indications are strong that it could be behind us and we are very confident that it will be behind us by Q4. J. P. McKim - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Got you. That's helpful. And then, I just wanted to ask one. It sounds like you finally have some competition on the pump side from Roche and I just want to see how you're positioning for that in Europe? How you're thinking about their launch? There's still a lot of room for you to grow over there, but how you're thinking about differentiating your product there? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. We certainly have good insight into Roche's product. We've been contacted by some of the customers in the UK that we're reached out to about participating in a clinical trial with Roche's product. So it's early days and I don't know that anyone has even seen the product, but they have received the user guide. And I think what we're hearing from clinicians is that it's a very complex product. In fact, one customer sent us the user guide and pointed out that it's not waterproof. It's fixed components and has a 12-step process before putting the Pod onto the patient. So I think at least early days, it certainly seems like a fairly complex not as user-friendly device. But our job is to make sure that we have the most compelling delivering mechanism and that we have the best customer service and the best commercial team in the market. So that's certainly what we're focused on. J. P. McKim - Piper Jaffray & Co.: That's helpful. Thank you. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes one of Doug Schenkel of Cowen. Your line is now open. Ryan Blicker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. This is Ryan on for Doug. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe starting on the U.S. Last quarter you talked about a potential modest headwind from the reduction of inventory from distributors previously helping you access United. It's clearly a great quarter in the U.S., but could have been even bigger. Was this to happen in the quarter and if so, how much? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah, Ryan, I mentioned that earlier. We did have a little bit of lingering headwind in terms of just the \u2013 the inventory ramped down from the previous distributor that was serving the United business, because we obviously took that direct. So there was a little bit of a lingering impact this quarter. And then the other headwind that we have that maybe is shown in revenue, but not in installed base is just really tied to mix. We had some surprise wins of Medicare, for example, and that just works against us a little bit. Ryan Blicker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Got it. Sorry, I missed that. And then, maybe moving to China, can you give us an update on how, if at all, you expect tariffs and trade tensions to affect your operations over the next 6 to 12 months given your significant Chinese manufacturing footprint? And on the new U.S. plant in early 2019, can you give us a sense of how much volume you'll be able to ramp production to in 2019 and 2020? I'm just trying to understand if the new plant will be capable of supporting most of your U.S. demand in case tensions escalate? Thank you. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: This is Mike. I'll take the tariff question. So we are not covered by any of the tariffs as described so far. So there have been broad statements about tariffs and that's not lost on us on why it's great that we have been establishing the U.S. manufacturing in advance of any of these conversations on tariffs. But right now it doesn't cover our product directly. That said, from a supply chain standpoint, it's something that our supply team is very focused on so that we have contingencies in case \u2013 even though it doesn't impact us directly right now, if it does we'll have secondary sources ready to go. So we feel comfortable on that front. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: In terms of the ramp up, so we will be ramping up in 2019. So we won't serve the full business probably in the U.S. in 2019. It'll probably be a late 2019, early 2020 event. And I think the good news is that we made this decision strategically to build our U.S. manufacturing before the administration change. So we really are ahead of the game and we should be able to, by the end of 2019, have the vast majority of the U.S. business served out of the U.S. Ryan Blicker - Cowen & Co. LLC: That's great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jayson Bedford of Raymond James. Your line is now open. Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good afternoon. Just a couple quick profitability questions. Mike, OpEx came in lower than we were expecting. I assume that P&L is carrying the cost of the 100 reps in Europe. What does the second half OpEx look like? Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: So specifically to your question about Europe and the international reps, as I mentioned in my earlier comments, we're right on track for the guidance that we'd given going into the year for the cost of the direct business in Europe of $45 million to $50 million run rate on an annual basis. So our spending in the second quarter, as we've been ramping up to that, is directly in line with our previous statements of what we expect that to be. In terms of OpEx in general, yeah, we are favorable to the guidance that we've given before. We are making a lot of investments to continue to drive significant growth on the top line. With all this innovation and sales force expansion and other things, we expect the next several years to continue to drive significant growth. That said, we watch spending very closely. And if we don't need to spend something, we won't. So, yes, we are a bit favorable to what we guided to from an OpEx growth standpoint, but it's not related to short-changing any of our growth initiatives. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kyle Rose of Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open. Kyle William Rose - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. Thank you for taking the question. And we're juggling a few calls, so I apologize if I ask and that's already been answered. But aside from the initial Medicaid, Medicare coverage policies that you cited I think back in the Q1, can you just give us an update as far as how your conversations are going with some of the payors with respect to getting on formularies and then expectations for when we'll have an outlook for that potential impact in 2019? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. Related to Medicare, I think you're asking, right, Kyle? Kyle William Rose - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Yeah. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. Okay. So, yeah, those conversations have been progressing really well and I think that's indicated in the two early decisions that clearly we've got a value proposition that is resonating with the Medicare Part D payors. The way that the process works is we were granted a CMS designation or CMS guidance in January. In April is when all of the negotiations opened for 2019. So from April really through August approximately, we're having discussions with all of the top Medicare Part D providers. And then really in August, end of August through October, they will publish their formulary schedules, and we will see how successful we were. So that means on the next call, which I think is early November or so, we should have kind of full clear picture of what type of 2019 Medicare coverage we've established. And the conversations are going very well. We fully expect to have broad coverage in 2019. Kyle William Rose - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. That's very helpful. Thank you. And then on the OUS business, I realize it's still early days as far as the transition and it sounds like you've got a busy six months in the back half of the year here. But just wanted to get an update on how you think about OUS longer term and particularly now that you took back all the rights. I mean, how you think about expanding into additional territories and if there's anything we should expect more near-term rather than medium- to long-term, so in next one to two years rather than maybe three to five? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. Yeah, it's a great question, Kyle, because I think it just highlights one of the primary strategic rationales for making this decision, which is \u2013 previously we were constrained and we could not go into a new global market or a new international market without our former distributor. So one of the main motivators was our ability to kind of get control of our international destiny and be able to invest and grow that business. What we've uncovered early on, we've already started new patients in clinicians' offices who told us that they've never seen an Omnipod rep. So we think there's tremendous opportunity to grow right where we are and that's where we're going to be focused from now through the end of this year and going forward. I think it's logical to assume \u2013 we see, though, we've had an increasing number of contacts from European markets where Omnipod is not available today for people who want to bring Omnipod there and same thing with kind of additional international markets. So we see a tremendous amount of growth and I would expect that the first wave of that will come right in Europe. We see a lot of opportunity through 2018, early 2019 to continue to grow where we are. I would expect in 2019 we may expand into some new European markets and beyond that we are currently building our strategy for continued growth in Omnipod. And as Pat has said many times, this is just the beginning of our vision to grow Omnipod across the globe. So we're really excited about the opportunities that support us. Kyle William Rose - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much for taking the question. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Patrick Sullivan. Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: Thank you, operator. I am completely delighted with the performance of the company in the two key significant milestones that we achieved this quarter : a very successful transition of the business in Europe and the market introduction of DASH. The teams have worked tirelessly over the last three years to bring these two projects to fruition. And I'd like to thank all Insulet employees for their dedication and hard work in achieving these significant milestones that will add greatly to the long-term trajectory of our business. Congratulations on a job well done. I'm also delighted that we achieved positive operating income of the $4.3 million for this year and remain on track for positive operating income for the year, the first time in the company's history. So thank you on joining us on the call today. We look forward to speaking you on our third quarter conference call in November. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC Operator : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Insulet Corporation Third Quarter of 2018 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Deborah R. Gordon - Insulet Corp.: Thank you, Crystal. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining for our third quarter 2018 earnings call. Joining me today are Patrick Sullivan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Shacey Petrovic, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Michael Levitz, Chief Financial Officer. The replay of this call will be archived on our website and our press release discussing our third quarter 2018 results and fourth quarter and full-year 2018 guidance is also available in the IR section of our website. Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to be materially different from any future results implied by such statements. Such factors include those referenced in our Safe Harbor statement in our third quarter earnings release and in the company's filings with the SEC. Unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Pat. Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: Thanks Deb, and good afternoon, everyone. After my opening remarks, Mike will provide detail on our third quarter results and 2018 guidance. Shacey will follow with an update on our achievements and key milestones and then we'll open the call up for questions. I am absolutely thrilled and impressed with the outstanding performance of the company in the third quarter. We achieved another record quarter revenue of just over $151 million, representing year-over-year growth of 24% and finishing at the top end of our guidance range. We achieved another quarter of impressive gross margin expansion to 67%, a 700 basis point improvement from a year ago. We also delivered positive operating income of $7 million and are on track to deliver positive operating income for the full year for the very first time in Insulet's history. In addition to our strong performance, we accomplished a great deal during the quarter on our key initiatives that will contribute to our long-term growth, namely the limited market commercial release of our next generation Omnipod DASH System; an exciting update on HORIZON, our automated insulin delivery system; our direct commercial operations in Europe and the build-out of our Massachusetts manufacturing headquarters. I'll provide a brief update on each of these initiatives and Shacey will share additional color commentary in her remarks. Our limited market release of DASH is well underway and we are receiving valuable patient feedback with overwhelmingly positive reviews. We are very excited to have this new product in the hands of our customers. We are making great progress on our Omnipod HORIZON development program. Based on compelling market research and terrific work by our development team, we are now thrilled to inform you that our HORIZON automated insulin delivery system will be controlled by an app on the user's own mobile phone. Since I joined Insulet four years ago, smartphone control of Omnipod has been the most desired feature expressed by people with insulin-dependent diabetes. In the last four years, advancements in BLE communications and cybersecurity combined with the outstanding work of our technical team have made phone control of Omnipod a reality. Now because of the tubeless nature of Omnipod, we will be able to provide an outstanding customer experience not possible by any other product on the market today. This development is a giant leap forward for the diabetes community, and we are thrilled to finally make it possible. Now, turning to our direct operations in Europe. Our July 1 transition from distributor to direct operations marked a significant inflection point for our business. We expect to exit this year with an international business revenue run rate of more than $200 million, and a long run rate for future growth. The entire organization managed through this transition in Europe, with great speed and extraordinary effectiveness. Now that we've had direct operations in Europe for the past four months we are more confident than ever in the strength of the existing business, the sizable market, and our opportunity to further accelerate growth. Finally, I'd like to highlight the tremendous progress we made in building our new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility and company headquarters in Massachusetts. The facility build out is nearly complete and in a few weeks we will begin installation of our first highly automated manufacturing line in the United States. We are on track to begin production early next year. Our U.S. facility will add the needed capacity and redundancy to support our growth. We are wicked excited and proud to bring Pod manufacturing and jobs to Massachusetts. Since this is my 60 and last Wall Street's earnings call I'd like to make a few comments before I turn the call over to Mike. When I joined Insulet four years ago I was attracted by what I believe to be an amazing product and technology with enormous growth potential. Revenues were roughly $200 million, gross margins were less than 50% market access was very limited and Insulet only had direct commercial operations in the United States and was losing money. I was very fortunate to assemble an extraordinarily and talented team to help me turn the company around. When I retire at the end of this year, we will have more than double the revenue; gross margins that are closing in on 70%; Medicare and Medicaid coverage is established; we are direct in Europe and we have a very rich and exciting product pipeline. And the most significant accomplishment is that Insulet has finally made the pivot to profitability. To say that we've come a long way in the last four years is an understatement. Today, the entire team is focused on driving Insulet forward and significantly improving the lives of people with diabetes. As amazing as the ride has been so far, there are so many more exciting opportunities to seize and patients to serve. I'm highly confident in the extraordinary potential that this company has, an amazing capability of this fantastic team. I look forward to watching all that Insulet will do with this dedicated team and what they will accomplish in the future. For me it has been a great privilege and honor to lead Insulet over the past four years. The future of Insulet is very bright and the best years lie ahead. Shacey has been a great Chief Operating Officer and will be an outstanding CEO. She is without reservation, the right person to lead Insulet's next phase of explosive growth and I have full faith and the utmost confidence in her leadership. Finally, I'd like to thank all the Insulet employees for their dedication and strong performance, the Board of Directors for their support, our Podder community for their loyalty, and our shareholders for your confidence and trust in the team. Thank you for the opportunity to lead this exceptional company. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike. Michael? Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: Thank you, Pat. We continue to make excellent progress and deliver strong growth and I am pleased to walk you through our third quarter financial results and fourth quarter guidance. Our third quarter revenue growth of 24% was at the high end of our guidance range. U.S. Omnipod grew 17% reaching $82 million. International Omnipod grew 55%, totaling $50.2 million and Drug Delivery was $18.9 million down 2%. We once again drove significant gross margin expansion, reaching 67.5% up 700 basis points, exceeding our expectation. The considerable productivity and cost improvements we've realized in our purchasing, manufacturing and supply chain continue to drive this expansion, as well as an incremental benefit of approximately 400 basis points from our successful transition to direct operations in Europe. Our operating expenses totaled $95.1 million, up from $71.6 million. This included spending in Europe, which was in line with our expected annual run rate of $45 million to $50 million and included a non-recurring charge of $12.6 million for severance related benefits due to our announced CEO transition, most of which is non-cash. Operating expenses were favorable to our expectations, due primarily to timing, which we now expect to occur in the fourth quarter. As a result of our significant revenue growth and the gross margin expansion, we successfully made the pivot to profitability, delivering a positive operating margin of 4.5% with operating profit totaling $6.9 million. As Pat noted, we expect to achieve full-year operating profit for the first time in Insulet's history, consistent with our stated objective. We also reached net income for the first time in Insulet's history, and are on a strong trajectory for both growth and profitability on track for our multiyear objectives. We ended the quarter with over $435 million in cash and investments, compared to $566 million at the end of last year, due primarily to capital expenditures, as we invest in U.S. manufacturing and supply chain operations in line with our plants. I will now update you on our fourth quarter and full year 2018 outlook. For the fourth quarter, we expect total company revenue of $159 million to $164 million representing growth of 22% to 26%. This includes U.S. Omnipod of $89.5 million to $91 million, representing growth of 17% to 19%. International Omnipod of $52.5 million to $55 million representing growth of 47% to 54% and Drug Delivery of $17 million to $18 million, down 2% to 7%. For the full year, we have raised our revenue outlook to a range of $558 million to $563 million, representing growth of 20% to 21%. This compares to our previous expectation of $547 million to $562 million. For full year revenue by product line, we expect U.S. Omnipod in the range of $320 million to $321.5 million, representing growth of 18%. This reflects our continued confidence in the growth of our customer base given this year's market access wins and strong commercial momentum overall. We also expect International Omnipod in the range of $169.5 million to $172 million, representing growth of 41% to 44%. For Drug Delivery, we expect revenue of $68.5 million to $69.5 million, representing a decline of 4% to 5%. Moving down the P&L, we now expect the 2018 full year gross margin will be 65% to 66%, a year-over-year increase of between 500 basis points and 600 basis points. We are thrilled with the tremendous progress we have made in margin expansion. And while we expect the ramp of our U.S. manufacturing next year to present a near-term headwind, we are well positioned to achieve our longer term gross margin objective of 70% in 2021. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, we are incredibly excited to deliver operating profitability this year and are reaffirming our expectation of full year 2018 operating margin in the low single-digit percentage range. Our successful pivot to operating profitability, even while investing significantly to continue to drive 20% or higher annual revenue growth is a tremendous milestone for Insulet. In summary, 2018 has been another year of high growth and successful execution for our business. As Pat mentioned, we have accomplished many operational, commercial and financial milestones this year. And at the same time, we remain laser-focused on the future. Given the positive fundamentals and catalysts for growth across our business and our current growth trajectory, we are well positioned to continue delivering significant top line growth and operating income and we are confident in our ability to achieve our 2021 financial target. I will now turn the call over to Shacey. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Thanks, Mike. I echo Pat and Mike's enthusiasm about our team's incredible progress. We're pleased with what we've delivered and we're just getting started. We believe our accomplishments today are building a strong foundation for future growth and I'm excited to share some of our key developments with you. Our global customer base continues to rapidly expand and in the United States, Q3 was another quarter of record new patient starts. We are reaffirming our expected U.S. Omnipod customer base growth of 18% to 20% and expect to finish at the high end of that range. And we are reaffirming expected International customer base growth of 20% to 25%. The first full quarter selling direct in Europe has confirmed our view that there is tremendous opportunity within our existing markets in the near-term, plus a longer term opportunity to expand into new markets across Europe and the rest of the world. We have completed a successful transition to Insulet Europe and are achieving our customer support and satisfaction goals. Our team of almost 120 very talented and experienced people is fully deployed across Europe and our focus now turns to growth. I was with our team at last month's European Association for the Society of Diabetes meeting in Berlin. This marked Insulet's first European conference since taking our operations direct. And it was clear that we are already benefiting from our move to establish Insulet Europe. Over the course of the week, we were able to meet with hundreds of European key opinion leaders and we completed substantial market research, which will shape our innovation and expansion plans. Our success at the conference was a strong indication of the tremendous support and opportunity we have throughout Europe and other international markets. Moving on to our market access efforts in the United States, our team is very effectively expanding Omnipod coverage. This year, we had three market access objectives. First, to secure and pull-through Medicare Part D coverage for Omnipod. Second, to expand Medicaid access. And third, to establish pharmacy coverage for our next-gen system, Omnipod DASH. I am pleased to say we are accomplishing each of these objectives. As of the end of September, we secured almost a third of Medicare Part D covered lives for both Omnipod and Omnipod DASH, including large Part D providers like Optum, Express Scripts and Magellan. We have also had more than 1,000 Medicare beneficiaries gain Medicare coverage through the exception process where applicants are averaging a greater than 80% success rate. Medicare beneficiaries can select a Part D plan that covers Omnipod or pursue Omnipod coverage through the exception process and will now have Omnipod covered. I am incredibly pleased with where we are today and confident our coverage will continue to grow for our Podder community. We also continue to strengthen our Medicaid coverage position and as of today have an Omnipod coverage for approximately 33.5 million or about 45% of all Medicaid covered lives. We expect this number to continue to grow during Q4 and throughout 2019. I am delighted with the progress we have made establishing coverage for our next generation platform, Omnipod DASH. By the end of Q3 we had approximately 75 million covered lives for DASH. We are thrilled that a growing number of people will now have access to Omnipod DASH to help manage their diabetes. The work we are doing to develop pharmacy access and migrate more customers through this channel is strategically important because it provides several competitive advantages. For the patient, pharmacy provides a better customer experience with lower out-of-pocket costs and no upfront fee to get started on DASH. For the physician, Omnipod can be prescribed with a simple e-prescription and less burdensome paperwork and documentation. For the payor, the pharmacy channel is a true pay-as-you-go, risk sharing model and for Insulet, this approach offers a lower cost to serve. This shift in business model presents a short-term revenue headwind but neutralizes over a full year and has the potential to dramatically reduce barriers to pump therapy adoption. Moving on to our innovation efforts, I have several updates to provide in terms of our progress, developments and timelines. Starting with DASH, we began our limited market release in July, following FDA clearance in June. We expect to engage 1,000 users and a 100 prescribers during our limited market release. User and clinician feedback has been incredibly positive, particularly around DASH's ease of use, intuitive design and the system's modern touchscreen interface. We know that our current and future Podders are anxiously awaiting DASH and we are working to deliver a terrific experience for the full market release in early 2019. In addition to strong user feedback, two recent publications in the Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology highlighted DASH's innovative design, features, and functionality, and Insulet's commitment to a user focused development process. The publications also reviewed the strong real world clinical data and outstanding early feasibility results for our Omnipod HORIZON, automated insulin delivery system. We are making great progress on our Omnipod HORIZON development program and as Pat noted, we have some exciting news to share as many of you know Omnipod DASH which was designed as an app on a locked down Android phone was Insulet's first step towards full control of Omnipod from a user's personal smartphone. Because it is the number one innovation request, we have been working hard to address the technical, regulatory and security hurdles and make smartphone control of Omnipod a reality. As Pat mentioned in his opening remarks, we are thrilled to announce that following remarkable work from our technical and cybersecurity teams and productive meetings with the FDA, we now plan to launch Omnipod HORIZON and future generations of Omnipod DASH with personal smartphone control. Like automated insulin delivery, phone control is a feature that is easily discussed, but very hard to implement in a way that provides a secure excellent customer experience. Omnipod HORIZON builds on the ease of use and security of DASH and by allowing users to manage therapy from their mobile phone while wearing just a smart Pod (20:43) and a Dexcom G6 sensor. The system will provide a level of freedom, discretion, and ease of use that is unmatched. While this adds scope and some time to the development process, we are pleased to announce that Omnipod HORIZON was recently granted designation in the FDA's Breakthrough Device program. This program is intended to help patients to have more timely access to devices by expediting the development assessment and review process. It offers an accelerated review and approval pathway for Omnipod HORIZON. Now with the Breakthrough Device designation and the exciting addition of phone control, we plan to complete a fourth IDE and estimate HORIZON with phone control will be on the market in the second half of 2020. Phone control is a significant differentiator for HORIZON and a great win for our customers. Paramount to our ability to deliver phone control is our commitment to cybersecurity. Just recently Omnipod DASH was the first pump to receive DTSec certification from the Diabetes Technology Society. This certification is a cybersecurity standard with the goal of raising confidence in the security of network connected medical devices through independent expert evaluation. This is a testament to the strength of our cybersecurity approach with Omnipod DASH which is the foundation for our innovation pipeline including Omnipod HORIZON, which brings me to our next update. As many of you are aware one of the more interesting movements in the diabetes device space today is interoperability. Interoperability is intended to enable pumps, CGMs and algorithms to be interchangeable components of automated insulin delivery systems. This has been strongly supported by advocacy groups, by industry, and by the FDA. Omnipod DASH was always designed to be interoperable and we're thrilled to support this initiative by enabling the simplicity of Omnipod to work with other algorithms and CGMs. As a first step in our support of interoperability, we are pleased to share that Insulet is the first pump partner for Tidepool's Loop program. For those of you who aren't familiar, Tidepool is a non-profit organization that is working to get an open-source iOS based loop app and algorithm approved by the FDA. Together we are developing an interoperable automated insulin delivery system that allows Omnipod DASH to be controlled by the Tidepool Loop algorithm from an iPhone. This partnership is additive to our internal Omnipod HORIZON program and offers a potentially faster route to market and automated insulin delivery system with iPhone control for our Podders and a terrific way for us to support the DIY diabetes community. So as you can see, we've made great progress on the innovation front with many exciting developments this quarter and we look forward to providing you updates on our progress. Before we jump into the Q&A, I'd like to take a moment to thank Pat for his kind words earlier on the call and for his friendship and mentorship over the past few years. With Pat at the helm, Insulet has driven considerable operational improvements, developed an exciting innovation roadmap, established a global footprint, and delivered outstanding shareholder value. Pat, you've been an incredible leader for the company and on behalf of all of us at Insulet, we wish you the very best in your retirement. I'm honored and excited to take on the CEO role. We have great momentum towards achieving our long-term strategic and financial objectives. And I look forward to continuing to work with the entire Insulet team as we advance our mission. With that, operator, let's open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you very much for taking the question and very nice quarter. I want to just circle in on a couple of things, clarification, the international number that you just printed does that include the $11 million you were talking about as a transactional or not transactional \u2013 translational fee or \u2013 fill in the right word there associated with you changing your distributor in Europe? Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: This is Mike. No. So there is a termination fee in our agreement with our former distributor, and that fee is not in those numbers. That fee will be determined over the successive 12 months following the takeover that we did on July 1. And that fee will be capitalized as an asset on our balance sheet and will be spread over a number of years. So that fee we do not expect that fee to be material to our P&L in any period. Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. It's probably my fault because I sort of rambled along there, but what I wanted to really understand is, is this a clean quarter without distributor impact associated with the transition or was there still a negative headwind in the quarter? Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: So, what we said on the last call is we said that we expect the fourth quarter to be representative of the ongoing run rate of the business, and the guidance that we just gave on this quarter was consistent with what we gave on the last quarter apart from a small foreign currency headwind. In terms of this quarter, we were very pleased that we successfully transitioned the business and had less disruption than we expected could be possible. So, that was very encouraging. And now the disruption is behind us, and we're right on track for a $200 million run rate international business coming out of this year. Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: Clean as a vessel. Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Clean as a vessel in the fourth quarter. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): All right. And then if I may, sneak one more in here, in the United States, how are you thinking about Medicare and Medicaid ramping into 2019? Thank you. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. Thanks Joanne. So we expect Medicaid to continue to ramp in 2019 and less so for Medicare, because as we mentioned on previous calls the negotiation and kind of establishment of coverage happens really between August and October of the previous year for the upcoming year. So we think we're in a great shape in terms of broad coverage because patients can select the Medicare plan that works for them and we've got some great broad-based plans covering it now, so we're in good shape. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. First off just the congrats to Pat on retirement and significant value accretive for shareholders. I'll miss not having a third time around with you. So maybe Shacey, I'll start with you and maybe Shacey, just thinking about the U.S. business this particular quarter, so momentum wise, it was a little lower than the prior quarters but your guidance implies actually a significant step up in momentum into the fourth quarter. So can you just talk about third quarter to fourth quarter trends and is there anything in that number that we should be aware of heading into 2019? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. I'll just stay at a high level and Mike can talk about the guidance. But at a high level, we don't see any diminishment of momentum. We had some timing issues in terms of orders in Q3 heading into Q4 but both quarters very strong and consistent momentum with earlier in the year and as we look forward. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: Yeah, David. I would just echo that, there was some timing that moved from the third quarter into the fourth quarter. And also there was some mix in the quarter that impacted the numbers. But, no, we were very pleased with the trajectory and as Shacey said, we're trending toward the upper end of the range on the installed base, the business is growing very nicely. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And just maybe two. One a follow-up, I'll just ask two and I'll ask them both together. Just to confirm on the ex-U.S., Mike, based on your commentary, the thought was that you would exit the year obviously on that 20-plus-percent run rate. But my math I thought the third quarter actually did better than I expected and the fourth quarter looks pretty stable with the third quarter. So do you think underlying the fourth quarter numbers actually getting better than the third is one question for you? And then just Shacey, you've talked about pharmacy benefit now the last two times you've spoken publicly. What is the process for getting the penetration of pharmacy benefit? What is the realistic way for us to think about the penetration of the pharmacy benefit channel in the next 18 months and what does that mean to profitability for the company? Thanks so much. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: David, this is Mike. I'll take your first question. So, yes, as we said in our last call, we believe the fourth quarter to be indicative of more of the run rate of the business and given the significant disruption that there was in the second quarter, we really \u2013 we knew that we had successfully transitioned the business when we gave our guidance on the last call one month in. But it remained to be seen, how much channel was in the market and so on. We were very pleased to see that our decision in the second quarter to buyback the excess inventory that our foreign distributor had really did mitigate disruption in the market. And so, so yeah, we did do better and finished at the high-end of our guidance in the third quarter and are right on track with the natural business growth into the fourth quarter. One of the things that we did identify as we looked into it is it appeared that the amount of inventory that Insulet had built up that we talked about on our last call, had been built up in the second half of last year and probably after the announcement that we were going direct. And so, that \u2013 in the second half of last year and beginning of this year. And so, that created a bit of a tougher comp for us here in the second half of this year, but there really was much less disruption, again, I think the actions that we took are really \u2013 made that happen. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: And so, in terms of pharmacy David to that question, so we see pharmacy as very attractive, because it's a growth driver in terms of reducing the barriers for people to adopt pump therapy and as I mentioned it's a lower cost channel for us to serve. So, I'm not sure maybe Mike can comment on specific contribution to margin, but I will say as we look to 2019, most of DASH coverage is going to happen in the pharmacy. That's where the team is focused. So, the DASH ramp is commensurate with the pharmacy channel ramp, and that's a lower cost to serve for us, but does present a little bit of a revenue headwind because we won't be charging for the PDM. That removes a significant barrier and in a given year, that's neutral and longer term we believe it will be a nice growth driver and a nice contributor in terms of efficiencies in the organization. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. This is Mike. I would just add on to Shacey's point on the margin. We feel very comfortable with our 2021 target of 70% gross margins. The largest contributor to that really is the improvement in operations and the successful launch of U.S. manufacturing where we're making great progress, there are other commercial initiatives. Pharmacy is a very good initiative to drive growth in the business. We don't expect that that's going to be a material contributor to margin at this point. We're new in that space, but we don't expect it to be a detriment at all. So we're very excited about that opportunity. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Your line is open. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the questions and Pat congrats on everything that you've accomplished, obviously you've had a great ride. First, just to follow-up a little bit more on DASH, I guess to ask the question more poignantly, you're about 75 million patients under coverage, is there any reason that you wouldn't sell that patient DASH going into next year, within that \u2013 at least that 75 million patient base. And then as we kind of look at our models, should we start to maybe take that \u2013 the $350, I'm sorry the surrogate cost out of our models for at least some portion of the patients throughout the year? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. Margaret, that's exactly how we'd look at it. As we look ahead and ramp DASH, it will become a bigger portion of our new patient starts and in that patient population, we will not charge for the PDM. So and I think you're right when we think about coverage, that's where we will focus in terms of new patient starts on DASH and maybe even conversions to DASH. The limiting factor we know patients are responding really with a tremendous amount of enthusiasm for the products that we \u2013 the limiting factor is going to be how quickly can we establish coverage for DASH. And what I'm excited about is, we are right where we expected to be if not slightly ahead. We're going to launch with a great established coverage, probably 100 million covered lives, that's a great spot, that's about where we were in 2015 with Omnipod and that will continue to grow as we look forward. So I think, it's \u2013 we're in a really good spot and it's going to get better but that is the limiting factor I think for DASH, as we look forward. Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC: And I know you guys aren't commenting on 2019 guidance or anything of the sort, but I think it was one of the conferences where maybe Pat has suggested that you expect U.S. to grow probably faster in 2019 than in 2018, so maybe if you guys can elaborate is that on patient adds, is that on revenues, any color would be great? Thanks. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure, I'll say we feel great about 2019. I think we've got a lot of momentum heading into the year. We are making a change in the business model and moving to pharmacy so that does present some potential headwinds but we don't expect growth to decelerate and so we feel really strong, and we'll give more color obviously on the February call. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: Yeah, we've had quarter-over-quarter record new patient starts this year, so I would expect that to continue. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Noted. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: Noted. I'll be watching. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Baird. Your line is open. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Good afternoon all. Pat, congratulations to you, but Shacey, congratulations on the new position as well. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Thank you. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: I want to start \u2013 let's see where to start, I guess. On the pharmacy side, Shacey, I guess my question is, as you get more and more pharmacy coverage and as it scales throughout 2018 and 2019, are you seeing any payors kind of tier preference towards Omnipod? Obviously, it's going to be much easier for the docs to prescribe Omnipod over some of the tubed pumps. But there's also that lower startup costs obviously rather than committing to a pump where we know a lot of patients do drop out in the early part of wearing a pump. So are you starting to see any pharmacy payors \u2013 any payors tier preference or move preference towards Omnipod over the tubed pumps? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Well. I'll tell you that. So I appreciate. I think that's exactly how we're thinking about it, Jeff. So we haven't had preference by payors yet, but it is definitely what's driving the step function change in access and why we've been able to establish so much access for DASH in such a short period of time. You think about it, we were just approved in June and now here we are in early November and we've established 85 million covered lives. That's a great position to be in and just a testament to the strength of the model of eliminating the upfront cost and sort of sharing that ongoing risk as the patient goes forward. So, we're going to look to continue to build on that value proposition with payors as we look to the future. But I think it's \u2013 to me it's working just given where we are today with covered lives. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then on phone control, and the interoperability that you talked about as well. Am I hearing you correctly then by the 2H 2020 when HORIZON would be ready to launch that would also have that iPump designation or whatever we're going to end up calling that? And then on the phone control, will it go from Pod to DASH to phone and you can just control from phone or Pod straight to a phone and you can take the DASH handheld out of the equation? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: So it'll go Pod to phone and you can take the DASH handheld out of the equation. And that's what Pat was referring to in his opening remarks that nobody can really quite match this value proposition because we really are going to eliminate a device that the patient is carrying around and really only Omnipod is positioned to do that super well. So we are thrilled with that configuration. We know it's going to be a winner and working very hard to get it out there as quickly as possible. And Jeff, I completely blanked on your first question. Oh, iPump. Yeah, so we're not really... Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah, horizon of (38:10) iPump. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: ...iPump. Yeah. So we're not really telegraphing our regulatory strategy. However, we do see that the system today, DASH is an interoperable system. And so, we fully expect to take advantage of all regulatory pathways for both HORIZON and \u2013 and then of course Tidepool as well. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: All right. Thank you. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. Your line is open. Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good afternoon. And Pat, congrats on your retirement, well deserved. I wanted to follow on the last question and HORIZON and congrats on the breakthrough designation. So timing on HORIZON is second half 2020. Will you be able to launch a smartphone controlled DASH before the second half of 2020? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: No, I think they're going to come around the same time. So... Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: We're working as fast as we can to get phone control in and so, we're lucky to be able to include it into the HORIZON program. But I think 20 \u2013 second half of 2020 is when it's coming. Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And just to be clear on the change in business model, the goal here and the expectation is revenue to Insulet per customer on an annual basis is the same under pharmacy versus the current structure? Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: Jason, this is Mike. So, just to be clear what we're saying is that the \u2013 it is going to be revenue neutral to the company on an annual basis. Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: So, that's what we're saying. So what we were trying to speak today is we think that pharmacy is a tremendous opportunity. It does by offering a no-charge PDM that does present a headwind in the period where you have a new patient start, but we're charging a little bit more for the Pod. And as you spread that across that covers for the loss PDM revenue and we believe it provides a benefit for everybody involved payor, physician, patient and for us. Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Very clear. And just one quick one here, Mike, the non-recurring expense of $12 million, that was all included in G&A. And then just as a quick follow-up how does the cost structure change in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter if we take out that non-recurring cost? Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: So in answer to your first question, the $12.6 million is all included in G&A. Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: And in terms of the cost structure of the company and what we're guiding to, we do expect OpEx to increase. As I said, the reason we were more favorable in the third quarter was really a matter of timing between the third and fourth quarter. So, we do expect OpEx to increase in the fourth quarter. That said, we reiterated our guidance for the operating margin for the year and honestly we're thrilled to be delivering on our commitment to be EBIT positive for the year and now net income positive as well on our trajectory. So, I'm really pleased with that and I think it positions us very well going into 2019. Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Robbie J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for taking the question and Pat and Shacey congrats on next steps as well. I don't want to minimize that the U.S. results, they were really good in the quarter, but I went back through the model and this was the first time since we kept track at least in early 2015 where you didn't deliver U.S. results above the top end of your guidance range. So maybe just help us understand some of the one-time items in the quarter or maybe what happened versus when you were setting guidance versus what played out? Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: Robbie, I'll speak to it because I think it's \u2013 Shacey can speak to installed base, but our installed base is growing faster... Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Correct. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: ...than what we expected. So, it really is a matter of mix and it's also a matter of \u2013 well, first of all it was timing as I said between Q3 and Q4, but it was also a matter of mix and we're really seeing the start of acceleration of our pay-as-you-go model as we described in the pharmacy. And so what that does is even preceding DASH we've been moving more and more business to the pharmacy and you get less upfront revenue. So we're having record new patient starts, but we're getting less contribution from those in the quarter. And so, we're doing better than we had expected in terms of the actual installed base growth, but the mix of where that growth is coming from, honestly, the pickup in this pay-as-you-go model is faster than what we expected. Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: That's a good thing. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: It's a very good thing. Robbie J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So, can you help us frame maybe what percentages in pharmacy or what the pricing is versus pharmacy versus the prior business or maybe if you don't want to do that just frame if you had the business on the former platform what the dollar headwind in third quarter was and maybe what it will be in fourth quarter as well? Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: If we didn't have the timing issues, we didn't have the mix, we would've been at the top end or above. So, as \u2013 which makes sense given what we've said on the installed base growth. The installed base growth is at the high-end of what we expected. And so, it really is a matter of what I just described. Robbie J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Maybe just one quick follow-up on HORIZON. That's really great news that it'll be controlled by the phone, but you do have two other competitors out there with hybrid closed-loop pumps, Medtronic potentially out, early 2020 with their NextGen and Tandem, other products. And so, how do we think about Omnipod over the next two years competing against some of these competitors. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Well, I'll take that one, Robbie. I guess I'll make the point that I always make, which is we're not really competing directly with Tandem or Medtronic and their innovation that has occurred to date has certainly not slowed us down. I think as everyone has mentioned this has been another record quarter for us despite innovation in the marketplace. And it's a really large fast growing market with significant unmet need. And I've never really believed that anybody has to lose for us to win. We're focused on \u2013 in the United States, 1 million MDI users and in this segment we just know Omnipod is incredibly attractive and it's a preferred product. So, certainly the market's going to get more dynamic, it has over the last few years and we're growing just fine and excited to continue that trend. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy from Leerink Partners. Your line is now open. Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC : Hi, good afternoon, guys. Thanks so much and congrats to you both, Pat and Shacey. Pat, we will miss you but I am confident that Shacey will continue to drive positive shareholder returns for the company and the shareholders, so excited for the next steps here. Just wanted to \u2013 I know it's very early days but you guys did get CE Mark approval for the type 2 pump with Lilly. And just curious sort of anecdotally what you're seeing how \u2013 sort of what patients are \u2013 how patients are using it, if patients are staying on it, things like that. Any sort of color you can give on the type 2 launch in Europe? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: So, Danielle, you are very well researched but a slight mistake. So we did get CE Mark for DASH actually or \u2013 yes, CE mark for DASH in Europe. So we are still just \u2013 in fact we haven't even publicized that because we're still working through our launch plans and we do have some work to do in translations, et cetera. So that's what that was. We are still working with Lilly to get U-500 over the finish line in terms of the submission there and making good progress on U-200. So I think, obviously we are still focused on the insulin intensive type 2 patient and concentrated insulins can help us address that patient segment. But actually what we're seeing which is to me really interesting is that DASH is testing extraordinarily well with that segment. It's actually a pretty fast growing segment of our user base in the United States. And phone control might be arguably just as if not more meaningful in terms of unlocking the type 2 population. So we feel really good even while we wait for concentrated insulins and Lilly to get done, we feel really good about our ability to unlock growth in the type 2 population. Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Sorry about that mistake there. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: No problem (47:08). Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. And just one quick follow-up from me; just in general if you look at your installed base in the U.S., I mean one of the potential needle movers longer-term to growth was possibly attrition and you guys have done a great job of stabilizing that and now with DASH. Do you think you can start to really move the needle on the attrition rate, because that could be very incremental to installed \u2013 I'm sorry to sales growth? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. I think the real challenge that we have in terms of understanding what is making an impact on attrition. We've got good visibility to attrition of new patient starts, but as the base grows and more customers go through various different channels we have less visibility. The great thing that DASH will give us is visibility to what's happening in those patient groups. And then a better assessment of what we can do to move the needle on attrition. But the great news is patient retention is very solid, has not moved, we're in really good shape there. But I do think DASH presents an opportunity as we look over the next few years. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Pasquale from Guggenheim. Your line is open. Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thanks. A couple of questions, I want to start with a follow-up on the DASH economics to make sure we're thinking about this correctly. When you say it's revenue neutral in year one that suggests to me that the higher price of a year's worth of Pods is making up for the loss of that upfront PDM revenue, but that would imply that revenue per patient in years two and years three should actually be higher since you're still going to be getting that higher Pod price, is that right? Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: Yes. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: It's right. Its right, except for \u2013 just want to, I guess, moderate the value because what we're also seeing is patients that are going to be migrating over who we wouldn't normally have sold a PDM too. So when we think about it being revenue neutral in a year, we're thinking about all of that activity being revenue neutral for Insulet in a given year. So I don't want you to go attach too high of a premium to pricing in the pharmacy. Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC : And then just on the Drug Delivery business, that's actually been more resilient this year than we thought so far but the Street is expecting Neulasta sales to be under pressure from here. It also looks like Onpro penetration maybe starting to flatten out a bit. Can you share any preliminary thoughts on how you're thinking about that business in 2019? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Well, I think, I guess the short answer is, we don't expect Drug Delivery to be any more of a headwind in 2019 as it is in 2018. It's just becoming sort of a smaller part of our business and so and because of the rapid growth on the diabetes side, it just becomes a little less meaningful. Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC : All right. Thank you. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel from Cowen. Your line is open. Ryan Blicker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. This is Ryan on for Doug. Thanks for taking my questions. You discuss what the ramping of your new manufacturing facility is expected to represent to have on the gross margin next year. Can you quantify at all how we should be thinking about that? Is this new, 67% to 68% a good baseline for the company moving forward or could there be some pressure early in year? Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: Hi. This is Mike. Yes, there will be pressure just purely because of the accounting as you ramp up a plant. And so you have to put your period cost into the P&L and they're just normal ramp up costs. So we do not expect that our gross margin is going to improve on a full year basis in next year than it is at this point. And that's really not because of the ongoing run rate, it's really a matter of the inefficiencies in ramping up the new plant. Ryan Blicker - Cowen & Co. LLC: Got it. And then you, Shacey, you noted that the Tidepool Loop algorithm could offer a potentially faster path to market than HORIZON. I was under the impression that the Loop approval would take a bit longer given how early staged that seems, at least from the FDA process. When do you think, that could reasonably get approved? Thank you. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: You're welcome. I don't really want to comment on specifics because it is technically Tidepool's program and so I'll let them do that as they make progress. The reason why we predict it could be potentially an accelerated pathway, and that's just a potential, is that the Loop product is an existing product that's being used by a few thousand people. So, it's already gathering data. They may have faster pathways to actually use real world data to support their approval and the product is also already a working product and so those things potentially offer some acceleration. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ravi Misra from Berenberg Capital. Your line is open. Ravi Misra - Berenberg Capital Markets LLC : Hi, thank you for taking the questions. Good luck Pat. So, just one on the P&L. And regarding your gross margin long-term targets you said, I guess, it's going to be led by improvement in operations in U.S. manufacturing. How do we think of how to layer in HORIZON when that does come? I mean, it sounds like you'd be getting rid of the DASH device completely. So, what kind of tailwind would that represent to margins? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: This is Mike. So, we were really pleased this quarter to be able to deliver out of our existing operations over 67% gross margins, which was really unheard of, it's not that long ago. So, that positions us very well for our target of 70% in 2021 and we expect opportunities to expand our gross margins following that. In terms of a particular product launch, it's definitely going to be helpful to not have a PDM cost in the mix, with phone control, but there are a lot of drivers, the U.S. manufacturing is a driver, leverage is a driver. So, there are a number of drivers for the gross margin expansion, and I wouldn't single out any one particular product as being overly meaningful to that. Ravi Misra - Berenberg Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thanks. And then just my follow-up is I just wanted to probe a little bit deeper on that non-cash severance charges. Was that a one-time event in the quarter or was that a pull forward, I'm just trying to think of what will be the new base here? Thank you. Michael L. Levitz - Insulet Corp.: So the majority of that was a non-cash charge of acceleration of stock comp. And then the rest of it was a cash severance charge in our normal severance policy. So it was \u2013 so I guess arguably the non-cash charge for the stock comp acceleration is somewhat of a pull forward, but \u2013 yeah, and it's all contained within the third quarter in G&A. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from J. P. McKim from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. J. P. McKim - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hi. Thank you for taking the question. And I echo all the congratulations. I wanted to ask on the Medicare Part D or getting coverage if I heard it correctly you're at one-third as of today and I was just trying to figure out, what's your kind of goal is internally by the end of this year and how should \u2013 how do you view the ramp in Medicare next year and whether getting the full, the other two-thirds on there, how important that is to accelerating that? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure, J. P. Ultimately our goal was to establish broad Medicare access and so while we may have gone about it in a slightly different way, we now have broad Medicare access. And I think what maybe, just to give some context around that, I think there's always this natural tension between maintaining price integrity and expanding market access. And so because we had seen just really good success with the exception process and because we know that Omnipod users each year can select a plan that provides them the best coverage, we opted not to compromise more on price than we thought absolutely necessary. So actually on balance we are extremely pleased with where we landed. I wouldn't expect actually coverage to ramp materially in 2019, but we don't believe we're going to be materially limited for Omnipod users \u2013 Medicare beneficiaries to adopt Omnipod. So that's kind of where we landed and we actually are really \u2013 I think the team did a really smart job executing the strategy and we're in a really good spot. J. P. McKim - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. So you're saying they can just use the exception instead of getting the full coverage. And then do you have any... Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Actually just to clarify that. So right now, every year a user signs up for a new Medicare plan. So the first thing that a user can do is just go select a plan that covers Omnipod and that's probably the first avenue, if for some reason they don't want to do that they can pursue the exception process. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kyle Rose from Canaccord. Your line is open. Kyle William Rose - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much for taking the questions. And congrats to both Pat and Shacey. I wanted to talk about HORIZON. Shacey, you mentioned a fourth IDE trial. Can you just walk us through what that trial looks like, is there anything different in the trial design or is that just simply you're actually going to be using the phone control before you move to the pivotal? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. So we opted to do IDE four to get really just more real world data under kind of real world conditions across all ages with specific challenges like exercise, like large meals or skipped meals. So that's really the goal there. And then because we had that time, we are pursuing phone control. So and then we will \u2013 for phone control specifically we'll have human factors requirements. But IDE four is about 20 to 30 people, looking specifically at those real world kind of more challenging scenarios. Kyle William Rose - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. And then just one follow-up on the Tidepool announcement, obviously very interesting, I just wanted to see why is that the right partner to go with right now? And I guess is it fair to think that you'll \u2013 we'll see future partners emerge in the future. I guess I'm just... Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. Kyle William Rose - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: TypeZero is a big player in the space, just kind of wondering why \u2013 if you're going to go with a partner, why not go with somebody you already have an established relationship with, Dexcom already? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. And I think that that's the benefit of interoperability and frankly the benefit of our DASH platform is that we can be interoperable with multiple algorithms and multiple sensors. So TypeZero is certainly a great possibility for that. We like Tidepool because it's a community that's already using the system, right. There's about a 1,000 \u2013 I guess almost 2,000 people out there that are using a hacked Medtronic pump and a Dexcom sensor and downloading this app. And so we thought it was a great opportunity to be able to work with them to get the Pod studied and cleared in the system that's already being used out there, and because it was iPhone control and it's just a great way to support the DIY community. So that's why we're doing that. It's really \u2013 it's a great little program but it is primarily Tidepool's program that we're integrating into. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Raj Denhoy from Jefferies. Your line is open. Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC : Hi, good afternoon. I guess a bit of a follow-up to that last question, but I'm curious to know on DASH in its current form, it doesn't seem to have the capability to have CGM data displayed. And I'm curious how long it would take or if that's part of the plan over the near term to be able to get CGM onto that display? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah, Raj. We made the distinct choice to do integration on a user's iPhone, so we don't plan to integrate CGM data on DASH. And we did that because well \u2013 mainly because users told us that that's what they wanted, but also because a user can use whatever sensor on their iPhone and kind of see that data. We have a great I think mechanism with Dexcom where we use that today wedged screen so that they can get their data both for their Dexcom and their Omnipod right on their iPhone. And so that's where the integration is taking place as opposed to on the device. And we always had planned to migrate everything to the phone and so that was sort of along with the stuff of secondary display on the iPhone. We wanted to get the CGM data and the Pod data there in one snapshot as well. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today's conference. I'd now like to turn the conference back over to Patrick Sullivan for any closing remarks. Patrick J. Sullivan - Insulet Corp.: Thank you, operator. We had a terrific Q3. We had solid revenue record results of over $151 million, continued our momentum of impressive growth with gross margin expansion of 67%, remain on track to deliver Insulet's first year of positive operating income. And this was probably my best conference call out of 60. And I'm confident and excited about Insulet's future and the significant contributions the company will make for people living with diabetes. As we close, I'd like to congratulate Shacey on her well-deserved promotion to CEO at the end of this year. With her at the helm, the company will be in great hands with an extremely bright future ahead of it. It's been a great run in Insulet and I look forward to a lot of fun in retirement. My very best wishes to all of you. Operator, I'll drop the mic and you can drop the curtain. Thank you for joining today's call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Deborah Gordon : Thank you, Howard. Good afternoon and thank you for joining our fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. Joining me today are Shacey Petrovic, President and Chief Executive Officer and Michael Levitz, Chief Financial Officer. We are also pleased to have Wayde McMillan with us today who will assume the CFO role on March 1. The replay of this call will be archived on our website and our press release discussing our fourth quarter 2018 results and first quarter and full year 2019 guidance is also available in the IR section of our website. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call maybe forward-looking and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to be materially different from any future results implied by such statements. Such factors include those referenced in our Safe Harbor statement and our fourth quarter earnings release and in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC. Also, unless otherwise stated all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis. And with that, I will turn the call over to Shacey. Shacey Petrovic : Thanks, Deb and good afternoon everyone. I am pleased to join you for my first earnings call as CEO of Insulet and to do so from our new company headquarters and U.S. manufacturing facility in Acton, Massachusetts. As most of you know, I assume the role at the start of this year after serving for the last few years as President and Chief Operating Officer. I am so proud of all of the company and our dedicated employees have achieved over this time. Insulet has made remarkable progress having just delivered our third consecutive year of over 20% revenue growth, improving gross margins from the mid 40s a few years ago to the mid 60s now and achieving net income for the first year in Insulet\u2019s almost 20-year history. As Insulet begins a new chapter our team remains focused on achieving our long-term strategic, financial, and operational goals. We are at an important inflection point transitioning the profitability, expanding globally and creating new pathways for how we can improve the lives of those with diabetes. I would like to review the highlights of our financial results in the fourth quarter and present some color on progress we have continued to make in executing our strategic initiatives. I will turn the call over to Mike to walk through our results in more detail and I will then come back to discuss our outlook for 2019. Mike and I will then take questions. Our fourth quarter financial results once again demonstrate our strong commercial and operational execution. It was another record quarter and we made demonstrable progress toward achieving our 2021 financial targets of delivering $1 billion in revenue, 70% gross margin and a mid-teens operating margin. In the fourth quarter, we delivered revenue of $165 million, representing year-over-year growth of 26%. We drove gross margin to 67%, a 600 basis point improvement from 1 year ago and we achieved over $16 million of operating income. This strong quarter resulted in both positive operating income and net income for the full year for the first time in Insulet\u2019s history. I continue to be incredibly pleased with our team\u2019s focus, drive and deep commitment to our customers. We are in a great position to create value for our shareholders in the near and long-term. I will now provide additional color on the progress we made throughout 2018, which was a year of tremendous execution and foundation building for long-term sustainable and profitable growth. We began 2018 with the much anticipated guidance from CMS that Omnipod can now be covered through the Medicare Part D or pharmacy channel. Securing this coverage has provided us with a direct pathway to the pharmacy as well as to state Medicaid coverage. And by the end of the year, we successfully secured Omnipod coverage for about one-third of all Medicare lives and almost half of all Medicaid lives. Together with the in-network coverage for Omnipod through UnitedHealthcare that we secured in early 2018, we have expanded our access to the additional 40% of the U.S. diabetes market we didn\u2019t have access to previously. We have already started to see the impact of this significant increase in access, which helped drive our record Q4 U.S. revenue and new patient growth. This expanded access establishes a strong foundation to fuel growth over the long-term. In June, we received FDA clearance for our next generation mobile platform Omnipod DASH. DASH is designed to be the simplest and most preferred insulin delivery system on the market as well as the foundation for our future innovation. We are wrapping up our limited market release and we look forward to kicking off our full commercial release in a matter of weeks. In a short period of time, we have already secured impressive coverage for DASH. We will leverage this coverage position and launched DASH in the U.S. through the pharmacy channel providing several competitive and strategic advantages for us. In the pharmacy by eliminating the upfront cost of the Personal Diabetes Manager, we are providing a better customer experience for the patient coupled with lower out-of-pocket costs. For the physician, Omnipod DASH can be prescribed with a simple e-script and less burdensome paperwork. And for payers, we have established a true pay-as-you-go model, which offers them less risk as they don\u2019t have to pay the thousands of dollars upfront for our product they would otherwise would for a traditional tubed pump. While we expect the shift in business model away from an upfront charge to be a significant win for Omnipod, we anticipate it will result in a temporary headwind in our year-over-year U.S. revenue growth comparisons. However, this impact to be limited to the initial months of the DASH launch and we anticipate very healthy U.S. Omnipod demand and revenue growth for 2019. And longer term DASH has the potential to dramatically reduce barriers to pump therapy adoption. Beyond our DASH system, we have already announced that with our Omnipod Horizon automated insulin delivery system, which we expect to launch in the second half of next year, we will make both hybrid closed loop and personal smartphone control of the part of reality. We are incredibly excited about our progress on Horizon development and proud that Insulet will be the first to deliver this experience to the diabetes community. According to recent independent market research from Seagrove Partners, Omnipod Horizon is the single biggest winner as a standalone AP product and respond installed that our patch pump design with phone control is the best embodiment of an AP pump. Omnipod Horizon will be game changing for people with diabetes taking glycemic control, ease of use and discretion to a whole new level. In addition to substantial progress on our new product innovation, last year marked significant progress on our global footprint with our successful midyear transition to a direct model in Europe. We have more than 120 talented team members with extensive diabetes experience up and running across Europe. We are now better able to support our large and growing European customer base and to gain market insights to help inform our innovation pathway and global expansion opportunities. Add to this, the significant top line and gross margin benefits and we have established a robust business with incredible growth potential. I spent time with our team in Europe a couple of weeks ago and it is clear we are strengthening our relationships with clinicians and payers adding new patients across the continent and improving on the legacy European customer experience. The most recent independent survey data from dQ&A shows that in the last 6 months, our European team has made an incredible impact and just as we see in the United States, our net promoter score in Europe is number one compared to all other insulin pumps. Finally, I want to touch on our new highly automated state-of-the-art U.S. manufacturing facility. As you know, over the past 2 years, we have made a significant investment in sophisticated custom designed automation that will enable us to reduce costs, continue to raise the bar on product quality and increased capacity. In fact even after all of the improvements we have made in China over the last couple of years, one line in the United States will provide up to 50% of the capacity of our total China operations with up to 90% less headcount. It is great to see our manufacturing automation in the clean room and undergoing validation. We are looking forward to being up and running shortly. This is truly an investment in the future, one that strengthens our supply chain and creates important redundancy and scalable capacity. We had a terrific 2018, which is reflected in our record results and our achievement of profitability. Our team continues to execute successfully on our strategic initiatives driving financial and operational improvements while improving our customers, while ensuring our customers remain at the core of everything we do. With that, I will turn the call over to Mike. Michael Levitz : Thank you, Shacey. Insulet continues its tremendous momentum and as a result the company once again delivered exceptional growth in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Our fourth quarter revenue growth of 26% was above the high-end of our guidance range. U.S. Omnipod grew 22% reaching $93.2 million, which was $2 million above the high-end of our guidance on strong and growing demand. International Omnipod grew 54%, totaling $55 million at the high-end of our guidance, finishing at a $200 plus million annual run-rate just as we expected and drug delivery was $16.7 million, that\u2019s down 8%, which was at the low end of our guidance range. Turning to gross margin for the quarter, we once again drove significant expansion reaching 67%, up 600 basis points in line with our expectations. This expansion was driven by the considerable productivity and cost improvements we have realized in our purchasing, manufacturing and supply chain operations as well as the benefit of approximately 400 basis points from our successful transition to direct operations in Europe earlier in 2018. Our operating expenses totaled $94.1 million, that\u2019s up from $80.3 million, reflecting the transition to the direct operations in Europe and our investments in innovation and product development supporting our growth initiatives. We delivered a positive operating margin of close to 10% for the fourth quarter and approaching 5% for the full year. We also achieved positive net income in both the fourth quarter and full year representing a true milestone. The company is on a strong trajectory for growth and profitability in 2019 while continuing the investments in strategic initiatives to support our near and long-term growth objectives. We ended the quarter with $430 million in cash and investments compared to $566 million at the end of last year due primarily to planned capital expenditures as the company invest in U.S. manufacturing and supply chain operations. In summary, 2018 was a tremendous and a very successful year, demonstrated by strong sales growth, significant gross margin expansion and the pivot to profitability. Since this is my last call as Insulet CFO, I would like to say a few words before I turn the call over to Shacey. I am extremely proud of the time, I have served as a member of this leadership team and all that the collective Insulet team has achieved together setting aggressive goals, consistently meeting or exceeding those goals and delivering on our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes. We have established a strong foundation for Insulet\u2019s near and long-term success and have positioned the company to fulfill its mission and continue to deliver significant value for shareholders. Insulet has very strong fundamentals in catalyst for growth globally. And I believe in this company and its management team\u2019s ability to realize Insulet\u2019s tremendous potential. I have so appreciated working closely with Shacey these last 4 years and it has been wonderful to get to know Wayde McMillan over the last month. Led by Shacey, Insulet\u2019s leadership team has tremendous character, passion and wisdom as for the extraordinary people across the company. And I know that I am leaving Insulet in very capable hands. I truly look forward to seeing all this team will accomplish. With that, I will turn the call over to Shacey. Shacey Petrovic : Thank you, Mike. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Mike on behalf of the Board of Directors and the entire company for his many contributions as CFO over the past 4 years. In that time Mike helped develop and execute our strategic imperatives, strengthen our infrastructure and capabilities in support of future growth and generate exceptional value for shareholders. I have been fortunate to know Mike for two decades and he has been a great colleague and a great friend. And I know I speak on behalf of everyone at Insulet when I wish him the very best. We have the right leadership team in place as we continue to execute on our stated objectives and drive toward our 2021 targets of $1 billion in revenue, 70% gross margins and mid teens operating margin. We are setup for an exciting year and I will now walk you through our 2019 outlook. For the full year, we expect total revenue in the range of $662 million to $687 million, representing growth of 17% to 22%. By product line, we expect U.S. Omnipod revenue in the range of $373 million to $383 million, representing growth of 15% to 18%. This reflects our confidence in the continued strong growth of our customer base, given this year\u2019s market access wins and our commercial momentum overall. We expect International Omnipod revenue in the range of $235 million to $244 million, representing growth of 37% to 42%, reflecting the great position we are in to continue our strong growth in our existing markets. Given that our go direct strategy in Europe began in the second half of 2018. We will have a much higher revenue growth rate in the first half of 2019, as compared to the prior year. And a more normalized second half growth of mid teens to low-20% in our existing markets. Lastly for Drug Delivery, we expect revenue of $54 million to $60 million representing a decline of 12% to 21%. For the first quarter of 2019, we expect total revenue of $152 million to $156 million, representing growth of 23% to 27%. This includes U.S. Omnipod revenue of $82 million to $84 million, representing growth of 17% to 19%, international Omnipod revenue of $56 million to $57 million representing growth of 46% to 50%, and Drug Delivery of $14 million to $15 million, fairly consistent with last year. As we previously communicated, we expect our 2019 full year gross margin to be consistent with last year, as the benefit of continued operating and supply chain improvements will be offset by the temporary headwinds from the normal ramp up of our U.S. manufacturing, which is proceeding on schedule. Once we are through this initial ramp-up phase, we expect gross margin expansion in 2020 and we remain confident in achieving our gross margin objective of 70% in 2021. We will continue to invest in our business this year, including in the ramp up of our U.S. manufacturing, our exciting innovation pipeline, led by Horizon as we gear up for pivotal, and to accelerate Omnipod adoption through the pharmacy channel in the United States. We therefore expect full year 2019 operating expenses to increase approximately 20% from 2018. But to remain relatively consistent as a percentage of revenue as we drive efficiencies to fund our strategic initiatives. We expect CapEx to be consistent with 2018, as we continue to expand capacity in our U.S. operations in support of our growth and profitability objectives. This is an exciting time for Insulet as we are now on track to implement to automated lines in the United States, which when fully ramped up will equal approximately a 100% of our capacity in China. This is important, because it creates scalable capacity and redundancy, provides us with the flexibility to respond to global market dynamics and over the long term, enable us to better serve our global customer base in a sustainable way. Finally, we expect to deliver full-year operating margin in the mid single-digit percentage range. In summary, we see a long and exciting runway of continued market penetration and global expansion. Our team is motivated and committed to strong and sustainable growth. We have multiple value creation at catalysts ahead tied to ongoing innovation further global expansion and continued margin improvement. We really are just getting started. And I look forward to an even more successful future. Now briefly before we turn to Q&A. As you know, Wayde McMillan joined Insulet earlier this month and will succeed Mike as CFO. Wayde joined us from Medtronic, where he most recently served as CFO of the $8 billion Minimally Invasive Therapies Group. He brings significant experience scaling large organizations and a thorough understanding of the strategies we are pursuing globally to accelerate growth. We are thrilled to have Wayde join our leadership team and I\u2019d like to introduce him now to say a few words. Wayde McMillan : Thank you, Shacey for such a warm welcome to the Insulet and thank you Mike for your partnership in the time we have had a working together over the last month and for the months ahead during this transition. In my first weeks, I had the opportunity to travel with our field teams and to meet employees across the company. It has been great to feel the passion insulin employees for improving the lives of people with diabetes. As a leader in innovation in the market, it is exciting to see the differentiation we have today and what our technology roadmap holds for the future. As Shacey discussed earlier, we have some compelling catalysts for growth both short and long term, including increased coverage in existing markets and for global expansion. As a finance leader, it is encouraging to join the company at this time, given the revenue growth and an inflection point we have, as we expand both gross margin and operating profit margin, a truly unique value creation opportunity. With an already strong leadership team in place, I\u2019m honored to join the team to help advance Insulet\u2019s mission and deliver on our commitment to customers and to create significant value for our shareholders. Thank you again to Mike and Shacey. And so those of you on the call today, I look forward to meeting you in person over the course of the year. Shacey Petrovic : Thanks, Wayde. At this time, Mike and I would be happy to take your questions. So, operator, please open the call. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question or comment comes from the line of Kyle Rose from Canaccord. Your line is open. Kyle Rose : Great. Thank you very much for taking the question. Can you hear me alright? Shacey Petrovic : Yes, we have you. Kyle Rose : Great. So I kind of wanted to walk through a little bit of the commentary on DASH very exciting to hear about the transition into full market release over the next couple of weeks. So maybe you could just kind of help us understand what you really learned during the controlled market launch and how that\u2019s going to give you the competence when you move into the full market launch? And then if you could just kind of help us also understand the puts and takes on any potential impact of gross margins when you think about your transition into the pharmacy channel. I think in the past you have talked about it a slightly higher ASP on the Pod, but maybe kind of offsetting some of the capital. So maybe just kind of help us understand the puts and takes there? Shacey Petrovic : Great. Yes, I will start with what we have learned and then maybe Mike can comment on the margin puts and takes, but the limited market release for DASH, I think was terrific for us. We were looking to validate the product performance and get customer feedback from a variety of different segments on the performance of the product and then also really evaluate and strengthen our support ability. So I think most people know, we have been moving to this pay-as-you-go model and incrementally increasing our business in the pharmacy channel and so we\u2019ve recognized that this changes in what we are doing today right, there is a difference in how we even evaluate, find benefits, and deliver benefits, how we distribute the product in terms of our dispensing pharmacies and our wholesalers and how we even train the patient and even product configuration. So we\u2019ve been testing all of those systems and ensuring we\u2019re in good shape from a support ability standpoint. And then from a product standpoint, the feedback has been terrific. The vast majority 95% to 97% of patients as bill that the system is easier more discreet, very simple to use, very positive reviews and actually from the segment of our limited market release that were multiple daily injection users, which is obviously our target segment 100% characterize it is easy to use \u2013 a 100% characterize that intuitive discrete and 95% prefer it over their previous therapy. So just really tremendous feedback from our targeted customer base and we are excited I think, we still have some work to do to kind of finalize everything around support ability. So you said a few weeks I said, a number of weeks and so I think we\u2019re looking really towards the end of this quarter to be expanding into full market release. And Mike? Michael Levitz : And from a margin perspective, actually, let me just speak to the impact of the move to the pay-as-you-go model in the pharmacy with DASH. This is because of our recurring revenue stream, we\u2019re fortunate to build to make this make this transition and there we do expect that there will be a headwind in the initial months of launch, because we are foregoing the upfront revenue while it has not been a significant part of our overall revenue. It still has been a real part of our revenue and so we expect the headwind from the move to no PDM revenue on DASH to be at about $68 million in 2019. That said, as we\u2019ve said before, we do expect the impact on revenues in the year to be neutral and the reason for that is we are charging a higher price per Pod you described moderately higher and we will be charging that for those people that the new patients where we are for going the PDM revenue and we also offer for those people who are already on the Omnipod who will be transitioning to DASH. And so the combination of the higher price for Pod on those combined population. We expect that will offset the loss PDM revenue. And so it is a bit of a headwind in the first few months, but it really is a tailwind going forward and we\u2019re really excited about this because we think it really differentiates the product and the patient experience and it\u2019s very beneficial for the company. In terms of the impact, the gross margin, which was your specific question, because it\u2019s revenue neutral in the year, we don\u2019t expect it to have a meaningful impact on gross margin. The low end of our guidance does reflect if we are not able to cover that the loss PDM revenue then we would be at the low end, but the underlying business growth supports a higher level and as I said, this is very good for us going forward. Kyle Rose : Okay, great. Thank you very much for taking the question. Shacey Petrovic : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen. Your line is open. Doug Schenkel : Hi, good afternoon and thank you for taking our questions. Maybe just starting with a couple of installed base questions, historically you have provided updates annually. I don\u2019t think you did this time in your prepared remarks. So I just wanted to see if you might provide us with how things went in 2018, specifically did you achieve your worldwide installed base growth target of 20% plus growth in 2018 and was there a meaningful difference in growth within the U.S. or internationally? Shacey Petrovic : Sure, Doug. We did achieve our objectives in terms of customer base growth. However, we are no longer giving that color for a variety of reasons. It\u2019s why we attempted to pointing towards kind of the revenue growth rates, which are in line with the customer base growth, the one exception and this is why we provided that cover is Europe, because we are pointing you to the second half which is our normalized growth rate. So we tried to provide you that color, ultimately because of our recurring revenue model, the customer base growth does line up with the revenue base growth and where it doesn\u2019t we will provide that color just as we did this quarter to make sure that you guys have that transparency. So I appreciate the question. Michael Levitz : Yes. And just to make sure, I am completely getting that it\u2019s essentially with DASH being revenue neutral. And based on what you just described Shacey essentially installed base growth should be pretty similar to revenue growth this year is that at this at the right conclusion. Shacey Petrovic : That\u2019s exactly right that as we move to that pay-as-you-go model and kind of eliminate the upfront cost, they really line up perfectly. And we will definitely provide color if for some reason, those trends separate and, but we don\u2019t expect them to. Doug Schenkel : Okay. And then I guess maybe just as a quick follow-up and I\u2019ll get back in the queue with everything we just talked about and keeping in mind your U.S. guidance is for 15% to 17% revenue growth this year. I\u2019m just wondering why growth would decelerate this year. There is a lot of catalyst including expanded market access and the DASH launch. So, I am just wondering why things might wouldn\u2019t be as good as last year if not a little bit ahead of last year, is this just earlier in the year conservatism or are there other factors we should be considering? Michael Levitz : Hi, Doug, it\u2019s Mike. I will speak to the guidance piece and then I\u2019m sure Shacey color as appropriate on the business. So, the guidance that we gave was 15% to 18% for the U.S. and as I mentioned previously, the low end of the guidance really isn\u2019t about the growth of the business, it\u2019s really around the change in the business model to the pharmacy with the PDM revenue since we are foregoing that if we don\u2019t cover that with the transition of existing users into the pharmacy, then that could lead you to the lower end of the range. So we are growing at a larger number dollar amount. We are off of a higher base. But we are accelerating the growth of the business, off of a higher dollar number. The other point I would just make is and I mentioned this briefly in my remarks as well as the fourth quarter was very strong and finished above our guidance because we actually saw some of those market access wins that we had expected in 2019 already materialized, which is great news and which is why we feel even more confident as we go into this year and so that does impact the growth rates a little bit, but it\u2019s already built into our strong finish and positions us well for 2019. Shacey Petrovic : All right. That\u2019s great. Mike. The only thing I would add is, I would point to what you just said, here we are In February, and there\u2019s a lot of work to be done frankly to successfully launched DASH and successfully transition into the pharmacy, I think you know this team executes well and we\u2019re counting on that, but we also recognize where we are and how much is to happen between now and the end of the year to get to where we want to get too. Michael Levitz : Okay. Thank you for all that. Very helpful. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Jay Chadha : Good afternoon. This is Jay Chadha in for David. Thanks for taking the questions. Shacey just on the ex-U.S. growth outlook, your comments said the implied growth in the mid-teens to low \u201820s in the back half of \u201819. I was wondering if you could give us some additional color on how that growth compares to what you saw over the past six months foresee it\u2019s in a transition maybe on an underlying basis, and how that compares to your growth expectations on an underlying basis in the first half of the year? Shacey Petrovic : Sure, so Jay, it\u2019s fairly consistent with what we\u2019ve seen, since we\u2019ve got our team established in moving forward, the big difference there from historic performance of Europe is France. So, as we\u2019ve said for actually almost a year and a half now and we were seeing extraordinary growth and penetration into France, we fully expected that that would moderate to kind of the underlying growth levels of Europe and we have seen that happen just as we expected it too. So, when we look at our existing markets, what we\u2019re guiding to is mid-teens high teens to low \u201820s in terms of growth rates. That\u2019s the underlying growth rate of these markets. We still believe that there\u2019s still a lot of growth we had there and our teams are focused this year on our existing markets. Jay Chadha : Thank you. And then just switching to the U.S. momentum stepped up pretty material into the fourth quarter, but guidance into 1Q implies momentum, was more in line with the first three quarters of \u201818. Is there anything one time that drove the 4Q beat in the U.S. or can you know in the fourth quarter momentum really continue into \u201819 given that the DASH impact you\u2019d feel would be more so beginning in 2Q given the sort of rollout? Shacey Petrovic : Yes, I think it\u2019s a great question. I think one thing to keep in mind Jay, is just that the fourth quarter is always our strongest quarter seasonally. So, we would not expect for example for that momentum to be continued into Q1, which seasonally is always our lightest quarter. So, we\u2019re just taking that into consideration. I think, Q4 is a great indication of the power of Market Access because we started to see that already in our baseline and we saw that tick up in Q4. Jay Chadha : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy from SVB Leerink. Your line is open. Danielle Antalffy : Hi, good afternoon guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. And Mike, just wanted to say I\u2019m sad to see you go, and it\u2019s been a pleasure working with you and we\u2019d excited to you. So quick question on the access point, so Shacey, you mentioned that you now have access to 40% of the market that you didn\u2019t have previously, but I think you said in your prepared remarks, you\u2019ve only got actual coverage for at this point for the third of Medicare and half of Medicaid, so hoping you could give a little bit more color on A how much incremental access are covered lives, I should say you have entering 2019 versus 2018 and B when we should expect for you to have complete coverage of the remainder of Medicare and Medicaid patients? Shacey Petrovic : Sure. So, Danielle, when we think about Medicare, we made a strategic choice to essentially in 2018. We were negotiating with all of the providers and we recognized two things, one we, having a lot of success, helping people through the Medicare exception process we\u2019ve actually help thousands of patients through that process, and then we also recognize that we could help steer patients to plans that covered Omnipod. And so, we really made the strategic decision to get coverage established with fewer providers in order to maintain our price integrity in the market, because we are seeing these other avenues for people to be able to access Medicare. So, we actually feel great about where we landed. And I don\u2019t know that a third of Medicare covered lives necessarily reflect how many Medicare patients have access to Omnipod through those channels. And the other thing to remember is that this process happens every year. And so, we\u2019re going to be back at the table with all of these payers, starting again kind of August, September timeframe so that we\u2019ll be able to have another bite at the apple event. And then the final thing that I would say is that Medicaid is the bigger opportunity for us versus Medicare. So, Medicare one thing that was strategically important to us is that it was a pathway to Medicaid, where there is obviously a large pediatric population and so very exciting to see that, that is something that\u2019s translating into real progress, we continue to grow our Medicaid coverage we\u2019re at 50% a covered-lives there or thereabouts. And we expect that to continue to grow as we look towards the end of this towards through \u201819. Danielle Antalffy : Got it. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And one quick point of clarification on the headwind from DASH. Mike, I think you said, entirely if I heard this correctly $68 million in total in the excuse me, headwind in the shift in business model from not selling the PDM, but I understand you expect to offset that on higher Pod prices throughout the year, but that is going to drive some volatility in the quarters that it sounds like you said, the majority of the impact is going to be in the first few months, so, is it safe to assume that a lot of that is going to happen in Q2 because it sounds like you go into full launch mode here in the coming weeks. It will be mostly in Q2. Can you help us understand, I understand commentary, a little bit or Mike, probably confuse that\u2019s also possible? Michael Levitz : No, you\u2019re spot on Danielle. So, the $68 million as a full-year number so if you just spread that evenly through the year as an example, you\u2019re basically talking about roughly $1 million to $2 million a quarter. And so, with the timeline that Shacey described DASH, moving into full release here in the coming weeks. It\u2019s then yes, the Q2 would be when you would expect to see more of that impact, because where it gets offset is as you add people into the pharmacy channel both new DASH users as well as existing Omnipod users, who move into the pharmacy both with DASH or otherwise. And we\u2019ve been seeing great momentum and move to the pharmacy channel, even to date. And so that will also help offset it. But again, I think the timeline you described is reasonable. Danielle Antalffy : Perfect. Thanks, so much guys. Michael Levitz : Thank you, Danielle. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Robbie Marcus : Hi, thanks for the question and congrats on the good quarter. Shacey maybe for you to start off, since you\u2019re new in the CEO role mantra Insulet in the CEO role and in transition at the CFO role. You could give us some thoughts on how you set guidance for 2019, maybe relative to 2018 and how we should think about some of the considerations that are in the guidance here? Shacey Petrovic : Sure. I think ultimately, we took a similar path to setting guidance for 2019, as we did for 2018. I will say both Wayde and Mike were very involved in that process. And so, we feel good about where we landed. I think, if you look at the range 17% to 22% anyway you cut it, really attractive, but it also recognizes that here we are in February and we just want to be thoughtful, as I mentioned to talk about what needs to play out over the next 12 months. We are really excited about the growth opportunities ahead of us that\u2019s reflected in the range, but we just also acknowledge there\u2019s a lot to do, where seven months into our European business. So, we are learning, a great deal there. We\u2019re launching a new product. We\u2019re driving a significant business through the pharmacy channel and we\u2019re implementing U.S. manufacturing. So, these are all really important things for the business that drive long-term growth and long-term profitability and sustainability. And, but there\u2019s a lot of execution that is being asked of and counted on by the steam. So, we\u2019re just recognizing that, that\u2019s what we do well, is executing if it goes well will be at 17% growth, and if it goes very well, it will be a 22% growth. Robbie Marcus : Okay, great. And just as a follow-up. First, I\u2019ll, Danielle sentiment, Mike. It was great working with you\u2019d look forward to it, but maybe Mike, you can give us a little bit on the cadence through the year, because I look at first quarter guidance and the U.S. growth number looks pretty healthy, international looks on trend and Drug Delivery is flat year-over-year. So maybe just help us think about the cadence through the year, any gross margin considerations, that\u2019s different quarter to quarter and then just if you could touch on the, reasons for the slowdown, I\u2019m assuming in the back part of the year? Thanks. Michael Levitz : Sure. Thank you, Robbie. So, in terms of the cadence of the year and the impact to gross margin, we\u2019ve got a few different dynamics playing out obviously. We\u2019ve got the move to the pay-as-you-go model, which we just discussed in the couple of questions. I won\u2019t repeat what I\u2019ve already said there, which is a bit of a headwind initially but becomes a very, very healthy tailwind, that we really believe is good for patients, payors and also very good for us. In terms of the cadence on the international side, we are absolutely thrilled with what\u2019s going on in Europe and you have secured a 50% uplift in ASPs and without an impact to the end customer, and having that materialize in our revenue growth is just tremendous. And so that is a difference in the first half, then, it was at the same time last year. And as Shacey described more normalized growth in our existing markets in Europe in the second half and so there\u2019s the cadence there. In terms of the Drug Delivery we expect this is going to be roughly consistent throughout the year is what we what we\u2019ve tried to do historically. We are not always successful, but we do have a longer-term forecast from Amgen that informs the vast majority of our Drug Delivery. So, we try and even out as much as we can with working with Amgen just reduced volatility. In terms of the gross margin, as I said earlier, we do expect gross margin to be flat for the year at this tremendous result that we had about 65% in 2018. So, we\u2019re thrilled about that. But the cadence is different. So, the first quarter, assuming that we launched U.S. manufacturing as we are on schedule to do in shortly, you really going to see that impact the numbers more in the second quarter and through the remainder of the year than you would in the first quarter. So, I would expect the margin trajectory in the first quarter to be essentially consistent with where we\u2019ve been for the last couple of quarters. But then there as I\u2019ve said in prior comments, we are going to take the accounting charges for period costs as you ramp in a new manufacturing and you ramp it up and as Shacey described we are thrilled to talk about the fact that we are now going to have two lines here Acton. And so, we are going to have a pullback of probably two points to three points in gross margin from this move to U.S. manufacturing. However, as I said earlier, that\u2019s offset in part by just the tremendous work that the operations team is doing both in China and other were otherwise that offsets that. So, all in all, that I think helps illustrate, some of the cadence here for the year on gross margin. Robbie Marcus : Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of J.P. McKim from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. J.P. McKim: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask first on just getting your take on the ace of the Ipump? And what\u2019s the Omnipod strategy towards obtaining that? As well as just ask about phone control? Can you move to straight to phone control quicker or do you need to wait for Horizon and I guess why? Shacey Petrovic : Sure, J.P. And so, in terms of the pump, I think it\u2019s great to see the agency just making these moves to support interoperability. I think we\u2019ve been talking about interoperability as the vision for DASH and certainly pool and horizon for quite some time and we have been in discussions with the agency as they work to establish special controls etcetera. We don\u2019t see any issues with special controls and so we do expect to take advantage of that pathway, but it really doesn\u2019t change our innovation plans it\u2019s really only helpful, but I think just a great example of how the agency is helping to find more pathways to bring innovation to the market. So great news for the community, great news for us, I think we\u2019re very positive about that. In terms of phone-control we could move to phone control more quickly than horizon. But we, it\u2019s a lot of work and it just made sense as we\u2019re going through human factors testing and all of the clinical and development work to include that as part of our horizon program. So that\u2019s not the end of the story with Horizon, we will launch with Samsung Galaxy phone control, but we fully expect to move to other platforms and that work is starting to be underway as well. So very exciting and we should just remember horizon is the second half of next year. So, it\u2019s right around the corner and we\u2019re gearing up for a great product launch. J.P. McKim: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And this maybe one more, just kind of strategically Shacey, I mean you kind of walked into the 2021 targets, but when you take your comments today on flat gross margins carrying OpEx 20% you really, you\u2019ve kind of back half loaded a lot of these growth of 70% margins and then mid-teens operating margin. So, how comfortable are you selling those targets and then just what about anything change, you got 300 million in cash for about M&A for the company or getting into CGM or smart pens are there anything that you as CEO looking at it differently? Shacey Petrovic : Yes. So, it\u2019s the main comment that I\u2019ll make tied to those 2021 targets is the biggest lever is gross margin. And, I don\u2019t really view it as back half loaded as you said, because here we are finishing this year above 65%, I think finishing the quarter somewhere close to 67% and so we are making great progress on that front. We always planned to take a step back so to speak in order to implement our manufacturing strategy that would then unlock the ability to further expand our gross margin. So, this is completely part of the plan, and I don\u2019t really view it as back and loaded \u2013 I was as exactly where we expected to be heading into this year, so\u2026 Michael Levitz : And J.P. this is Mike. I would just add an on Shacey comments for the 2021 targets, we are exactly where we had planned to be. This was always the idea of this ramp of U.S. manufacturing and how this is going to play out in gross margins in terms of the operating margin. Look, as we\u2019ve said in previous periods like we could go and get the double-digit operating margin outlook, you saw this Q4, we were at 10% Q3 we were strong. I mean, so if we, if we were not investing for what we believe to be a very strong robust future of significant growth. Then yes, we can get to that tomorrow. So, I think the broader point, we\u2019ve now demonstrated what this business can do from our revenue growth, gross margin and profitability standpoint and we\u2019re positioned exactly where we want it to be making investments in the pharmacy channel, which really differentiates the product. And really honestly, we\u2019re already driving operator operating leverage across the rest of the business. We just had very targeted investments, innovation and these things like the pharmacy channel, which we believe really drive shareholder value. Shacey Petrovic : And maybe at last two comments are I was really arm-in-arm with Pat in establishing these targets and laying out the strategy, so there is just as much my as anybody else\u2019s and we are not going to short change our top line growth opportunities and that\u2019s what you see this year, but we fully believe that we can unlock the top line growth and deliver on those targets that we shared. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. Your line is open. Jayson Bedford : Thanks and good evening. Just a couple of questions for me. You mentioned that you are pleased with the coverage for DASH, can you comment on the number of lives under coverage and what percent of those are have access through the pharmacy? Shacey Petrovic : Sure. Yes, we have about $120 million covered lives for DASH now. So that right, actually a little bit ahead of where we expected to be on full market release. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to report on that on an ongoing basis. But just to give you some visibility to we feel like we\u2019re in a strong position to launch and about 10% of our business today is already in the pharmacy channel and so we expect that to grow. If you look at where we are from covered lives about a third of all Omnipod covered lives and so that\u2019s right now kind of the access position and we expect that to grow through the year. Jayson Bedford : Is there a situation though when you launch a full launch of DASH that new people Omnipod today that won\u2019t have access to DASH that because of reimbursement? Shacey Petrovic : Yes, that\u2019s right, because we are leveraging DASH to move into the pharmacy channel. And so there will be some limitations in terms of reimbursement for DASH. I mean part of the benefit of the pay-as-you-go business model is that there really isn\u2019t a reason why as soon as the patient gets access to DASH because we\u2019ve been able to establish pharmacy coverage they can convert to DASH if they so choose to do that. So, we don\u2019t see people kind of waiting for it being a problem, etcetera. And they can\u2019t really convert very quickly once they have access and that is the primary focus of our market access team today is to expand access through the pharmacy channel for DASH. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from BMO. Your line is open. Joanne Wuensch : Can you hear me okay? Shacey Petrovic : Yes. Joanne Wuensch : Terrific. Thank you so much for taking the question. It feels like we\u2019ve really focused on sort of the four key things which is the U.S. Pharmacy, the OUS Direct, Horizon and gross margins. Is there something that we\u2019re missing or is there something that you\u2019re like, I just wish where you had the opportunity to talk about X or we just \u2013 we really understand it [indiscernible] around these sort of four factors? Shacey Petrovic : I think you do \u2013 the one thing that you didn\u2019t mention, which is just a really important long-term value driver for the company is U.S. manufacturing. So, we talked a little bit about it, but I think the fact that where we are now establishing our second line and creating this much capacity, we fully expect in the U.S. that, that has the ability to drive down costs to increase quality and also to obviously give us much needed capacity and redundancy. And so that is a massive value driver and kind of strengthening of the position that we\u2019re in as a company. So, I could not be more thrilled about that investment and what is the promise that it\u2019s going to deliver on for the company. Joanne Wuensch : And second question, can we just spend a moment on Drug Delivery, I know we don\u2019t really think about at all too much, but it looks like it\u2019s a little bit heavier in 2019 than it was in 2018, when I mean heavier, it\u2019s just declining a little bit faster, any thoughts on that one? Shacey Petrovic : Yes, I mean, I think our guidance for Drug Delivery is always based primarily on Amgen\u2019s forecast and then our production planning, so that\u2019s what\u2019s factored really into the range and into the guidance. We still view Drug Delivery as an exciting long-term growth opportunity. I think Amgen and our partnership is very strong and it\u2019s a great example of what can be done, but this is also just the reality as the competitive market changes that\u2019s reflected obviously in the forecast from Amgen. Michael Levitz : And I would just add it\u2019s \u2013 we are obviously not thrilled when the forecast come down, but Drug Delivery is now less than 10% of our revenue. And so it really didn\u2019t have all that meaningful of an impact on us, because it is so much a smaller part of our business and the other parts of our business are growing so rapidly. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Everyone, thanks for taking the question. This is Brandon in for Margaret. I just wanted to start off and as we\u2019re talking more about the pharmacy channel, in your early experiences, are you guys seeing any notable differences in utilization between DME patients and pharmacy, and I guess, by that, I mean, since the pharmacy passes presumably easier \u2013 much easier for patients, are they reordering more often, is it better compliance and resulting in better utilization? And then kind of a follow-up to that is, are you seeing similar benefits through physicians who are saying well now this is such an easy process going through scripts, I\u2019m going to recommend more Omnipod than I am going to other competitive pumps? Shacey Petrovic : Brandon, I think those are great questions. And outside of utilization, I think you really described our vision for the pharmacy channel. I don\u2019t know that we necessarily think utilization is going to increase substantively, but we definitely believe that this channel will provide a better customer experience for both the patient and the physician. And so I don\u2019t have specific feedback to give you yet because I think it\u2019s a little bit early days, but we will be looking for that type of patient feedback in the channel and physician feedback and early feedback from the limited market release has been very positive in terms of the patient experience in the pharmacy. Michael Levitz : Yes, the only other thing I would add is just that we are seeing acceleration with our existing product in the pharmacy, so it\u2019s \u2013 it definitely is being well received. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thanks. And a quick follow-up on the international side. Could you remind me outside of or remind all of us outside of Europe, how many other international markets you\u2019re in, I guess, just trying to understand if there is a blended ASP of Omnipod increase that we should think about in the international market? And then if there are any plans in 2019 to expand into new markets as well? Thank you. Shacey Petrovic : I\u2019ll start and I\u2019m sure Mike can add some color. So today we are in a handful of markets in Europe really I think 9 or 10 countries in total, 5 of any substance. We are in Canada and we are in the United States and Israel. So, it\u2019s a pretty limited really geographic footprint. It\u2019s one of the reasons why we\u2019re so excited about the investment that we made in our decision to terminate this legacy distributorship, because it unlocks now our ability to expand to new global markets. And so we\u2019re in the process now in 2019 of really doing the research and prioritizing and categorizing the most attractive markets that we may want to move into. In 2019, our guidance really contemplates our existing markets and growing further in \u2013 you mentioned ASPs, the only thing I\u2019ll mention is that the guidance range in international does contemplate pricing pressures on the lower end, so that\u2019s \u2013 that is factored into the guidance. Michael Levitz : And I would just add that I\u2019m glad you brought up the question because sometimes you\u2019ll get confused. So, Europe represents roughly 85% of our international revenues and so that 50% uplift on the ASP by us going direct in replacing one layer there in Europe, that 50% uplift applies to Europe, it doesn\u2019t apply to the rest of the international business and sometimes that\u2019s confusing. So, thank you for the question. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Operator : Thank you. We have time for one more question. Our final question for this evening  comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Baird. Your line is open. Jeff Johnson : Hey guys, good afternoon. Can you hear me okay? Shacey Petrovic : Yes, Jeff. Jeff Johnson : Great. Shacey, I don\u2019t want to over-read your comments, but you\u2019ve mentioned now Horizon launch in the second half of 2020 a couple of times and I\u2019ve heard it kind of second half 2020, I\u2019ve heard it late 2020? Have you had any kind of increased visibility from FDA on the pathway there, any change in confidence levels, just anything that\u2019s developed over the last few months since we last talked about that? Shacey Petrovic : I think we \u2013 this is the great thing about the breakthrough devices program, frankly, it\u2019s just that we have a lot of collaboration with the agency. And so we\u2019ve been talking a lot through the clinical development plan and making sure that we have the most efficient and effective pathway to market, so a bit more clarity around that. And so, but no, nothing\u2019s really changed in our guidance, so our timeline [indiscernible] that it will be earlier. I just \u2013 I feel very good about the progress that we\u2019re making both on the development front and on the clinical plan. Jeff Johnson : Alright, that\u2019s helpful. And then just follow-up question, just on the international market. When might we see DASH in the international market, and do we need to think about a similar kind of headwind initially on the conversion and then \u2013 an uplift on higher priced pods or will it still work the same way outside the U.S.? Thank you. Shacey Petrovic : Great, and that\u2019s a really good question, Jeff. So, we\u2019re in the process of kind of doing all of the evaluation work to understand the right go-to-market strategy. It\u2019s not clear to me that we will launch with a similar model, so, I don\u2019t think I would include that headwind as it relates to our international markets. We know there\u2019s a lot of demand, in fact, just last week at ATTD, we demoed DASH for European physicians and none of them wanted to give the system back to us. So, we are working very hard to make sure that we can launch that product across Europe, I would expect that to be more of a late \u201819, early 2020 launch in Europe. Operator : Thank you. So, we can extend our Q&A session. So, our next question or comment comes from the line of Ravi Misra from Berenberg. Your line is open. Ravi Misra : Hi, thank you for taking the question. I just wanted to get a couple of clarity \u2013 and Mike congratulations and good luck in the future. Just wanted to get a little bit clarity on those 2021 targets, I think you said above market profitability in the long-term. Can you just help us peg down what you mean by what market profitability actually is? And then secondly just on the OpEx commentary, Shacey, how should we think about that as it kind of pertains to the S&M and G&A, I apologize if you went over that already, just been switching between calls? Thanks. Shacey Petrovic : Great. Michael Levitz : Well, I\u2019m happy to start and Shacey please obviously fill in. So, in terms of the \u201821 targets of above market profitability, as Shacey said, we\u2019re really viewing that as mid-teens. Now when we set that target in 2016 for 2021, what\u2019s market \u2013 the diabetes market, nobody was delivering that kind of profitability. And so what we really try to do is target something that reflected our view that you really could \u2013 you could make decent and appropriate profit in this business. That as I said before is not the end of the story for this company. We just felt like setting a target that we thought was reasonable and appropriate given that the company had been in a loss position. This is the first year now, we\u2019ve now delivered as we said we would positive EBIT for the full-year and we delivered positive net income. And that really \u2013 that net income is ahead of schedule and positions us very well for the 2021 targets of mid-teens. In terms of the OpEx guidance and Shacey could speak to, but I\u2019ll just reiterate my earlier comment, which is the largest piece of the increase there is really on innovation and we\u2019re a year away now from Horizon in the second \u2013 as Shacey said in the second half of \u201820 and there\u2019s just a good amount of development work that we\u2019re working on. Apart from that and the move to the pharmacy, which over time will really benefit us, we\u2019re driving leverage across the business, and so that would include G&A, that would include sales and marketing in across the business. Shacey Petrovic : Yes, since you just specifically mentioned sales and marketing, there is an investment this year to be able to improve our capabilities in the pharmacy channel and to really to be able to effectively move patients from the DME channel to the pharmacy channel. So, that is an investment that we believe is a complete worthy investment because as we look out then over the Horizon, it\u2019s a more attractive channel for us for a number of reasons. And that\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 some of that investment is one-time investment captured in OpEx. Ravi Misra : And just if I can may just seek a follow-up there, that, that should \u2013 should that lead to higher ROI per patient just because, I mean, is it the case that the pharmacy channel is less expensive to service the patient on a kind of profit per patient dynamic there, so that should lead to leverage in the out-years? Michael Levitz : I\u2019ll comment and then Shacey can jump in. I think Shacey made the comment in the past that we don\u2019t expect the pricing to be different the value to be different on the customer revenue side, there is a lower cost to being in the pharmacy channel over time. There\u2019s just \u2013 and one of the reasons we\u2019ve said it\u2019s beneficial is, it\u2019s just less work, and so that\u2019s only less work for the physicians and less work for the users, it\u2019s less work for us and work really constitutes cost. And so that doesn\u2019t materialize right away, but it is very real. Shacey Petrovic : Yes, no, that\u2019s right, you captured. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Steven Lichtman from Oppenheimer and Company. Your line is open. Steven Lichtman : Thank you for squeezing me in. I\u2019ll just stick with one, guys within your U.S. guidance, I was wondering if you could share what mix of your installed base, you\u2019re assuming will be going through the pharmacy channel as we exit 2019? I think Shacey you mentioned, it\u2019s about 10% today or if you \u2013 you can\u2019t provide that specifically. Any commentary you can provide on how we should be thinking about that ramp of the pharmacy mix over the next 12 months to 24 months? Shacey Petrovic : Yes, I think it\u2019s a great question. So today, I said it\u2019s somewhere around 10%. If we were \u2013 if you just think about where we are from a coverage position, so I think I mentioned about 30%, a third \u2013 120 million covered lives, it\u2019s about a third of covered lives have access to DASH. So, if we were able to track them all down and convert them all, we would move from 10% to 30%. We don\u2019t expect to have 100% batting average on that, but that\u2019s kind of the guardrails as you think about how that might ramp this year. Steven Lichtman : Okay, great. Thanks, Shacey. Shacey Petrovic : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Chris Pasquale from Guggenheim. Your line is open. Chris Pasquale : Thanks. One follow-up on DASH, does the $6 million to $8 million [ph] headwind you talked about, it\u2019s about a quarter to a third of what we estimate your U.S. PDM revenue was in 2018. Just to set a baseline, I know you guys don\u2019t usually give explicit numbers there, but is that in the right ballpark? Michael Levitz : Hi, Chris, it\u2019s Mike. Yes. We really don\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t break that out. What I would say though is, what we\u2019ve talked about in foregone PDM revenue is related to the launch of DASH and the pay-as-you-go model. We\u2019re still going to be selling our existing Omnipod globally. And so it\u2019s not like we\u2019re going to zero in PDM revenue in a year. And, in fact, we even started a little bit of the move to the pay-as-you-go model here in 2018. So, we\u2019re not \u2013 we don\u2019t break that out on a total number, but I just wanted to give a rough number so that people could get a sense of the impact. Chris Pasquale : Okay. And then Mike, just one follow-up for you, the mix of operating expenses during the fourth quarter was little different than we had expected big jump in R&D spending in particular. Any color on how you would expect the growth rates of those two lines to maybe compare to the overall 20% OpEx growth in 2019? Michael Levitz : Absolutely. And, in fact, this is a little bit of what I spoke to when we are on the Q3 call, which was that we really did expect the operating expenses to ramp up in the fourth quarter and specifically in development and that\u2019s exactly what happened. And it really is related to the work that\u2019s going on now with DASH finishing that the international work and most specifically Horizon. There\u2019s going to be work in 2019 on Horizon, which is now a year away and so it\u2019s the development work and it\u2019s the clinical work that\u2019s built into R&D. So, I would expect R&D to grow faster than the rest of OpEx. That\u2019s really the number one driver of the growth in spending and it really is because of the value that we see from this innovation globally. We will \u2013 there will be some growth in sales and marketing and that is specific to the move to the pharmacy channel and making sure we have the infrastructure to support that, over time, as I say, that will come down as a cost of the company. And we are driving operating leverage across the company, across OpEx, across operations to fund these things, because we really do believe these initiatives drive real value. Operator : Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Matt Taylor from UBS. Your line is open. Matt Taylor : Hi, thank you for taking the question. So, I wanted to ask two things. The first one was just on Drug Delivery I think we understand there is some pressure there this year. What I want to ask you about is, a couple of years ago at your Analyst Day, you\u2019d talked about this potentially being a much bigger business over time with more opportunities. Is that still the case or you \u2013 have you just pivoted here with the bigger opportunities in the core insulin pump business? Shacey Petrovic : I think both are true just depending on the time horizon that you look at it. When \u2013 so in terms of the 2021 targets, I think we always said, we don\u2019t need another Amgen to hit those. And one of the big, I guess, challenges I call them champagne problems here at Insulet that we have is, we have so many different opportunities that we could pursue for growth, it\u2019s just as important that we determine what are we going to do. And so when we look at the Drug Delivery, we had so much activity underway, some of that was with commercial asset but it\u2019s much more reliable, some of that was really early stage stuff that was incredibly bandwidth-intensive and had a high failure rate. And so any of these programs even if you look at like a concentrated insulin or you look at Neulasta, these could be 7-year programs even for commercially available molecules. And so it\u2019s just a longer-term development Horizon, the longer-term growth opportunity and frankly, right now we happily have our hands full growing the diabetes business. If you take out Drug Delivery, diabetes is growing 23% to 27% this year, and we haven\u2019t even really delivered on some exciting growth catalysts as we look over the future. So, I do think that\u2019s where our focus is. We still have activity going on in Drug Delivery, but we\u2019re being a little bit more selective about the programs and we do view it as a longer-term opportunity. Matt Taylor : Okay. And then just one follow-up so \u2013 and Mike, congrats on a great few years, it\u2019s been great working with you. And I did want to go back to one of your comments, you said that you had some access wins that\u2019s helped in the fourth quarter. And we all know sort of what big picture those are. I was wondering if you could give us just a little bit of color on which ones specifically helped in the fourth quarter or anything on the pacing of those or other ones and that could help during this year? Michael Levitz : Well, first of all, thank you, Matt. And Shacey may be better able to answer that question, but I will say that on the access wins, one of the things that we\u2019ve talked about before is that with Medicare, we were starting to see some real wins in the exception process and that started to kick in here early and was really beneficial. And so we\u2019ve had wins, I can\u2019t tell them, I can\u2019t call out by name, but we\u2019ve had some pretty significant wins and it \u2013 we\u2019ve had wins in Medicaid, we\u2019ve had wins in Medicare, we\u2019ve had wins commercially. And some of the things as I say that we thought we\u2019re going to kick in, in \u201819 on Medicare have actually come early. And so I mean the growth that we\u2019re seeing in our customer base is just \u2013 in our new starts, it\u2019s just fantastic. And it really reflects the fact that when people have access to this product, they do want this product. Operator : Thank you. Our final question or comment comes from the line of Suraj Kalia from Northland Securities. Your line is open. Suraj Kalia : Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for squeezing me in. So first and foremost, Mike, it\u2019s been a pleasure working with you, wish you the very best in your future endeavors. Shacey, let me \u2013 typical questions and forgive me if they have been asked by others. Can the Omnipod be configured with Libre 2.0 if they receive an high designation? Shacey Petrovic : Yes, that\u2019s a beautiful thing about this pathway that the FDA has created if they were able to reach special controls then certainly it could be a very easy clinical path to integration of their sensor in for example Horizon down the road. Suraj Kalia : Got it. And finally, Shacey, as you look at FY \u201821 and beyond, obviously, you guys are going to be running ahead on Horizon. If I look at one of the themes at ATT this time was you know, most of the closed-loop pumps are in the 70% to 80% time and range. How do you view? What differentiates one closed loop system from another? Thank you for taking my questions. Shacey Petrovic : Sure, Suraj. And I think it\u2019s a great question. I\u2019ll just say two things. First of all, all the data on these systems is collected in varying ways, some data is looking at very well-controlled population, and other data is looking at more real world data. So, I think we have to be skeptical about just all of the variety of performance. I think when we look at the real differentiators on the system, it\u2019s about how do all of these pieces of the system come together to work easily and elegantly for the user, because the better experience that they have in terms of the user interface and in terms of how the sensor and the pump work together, the more time and range, the more time that they\u2019re going to spend in closed loop and that translates to more time in range. And so that\u2019s why we have been so focused, I mean, just laser-focused on the customer experience, the user interface and on designing a simple system that could be used for MDI users, as well as children, because I think it\u2019s going to come down to how the user experience translates for the system. Operator : Thank you. I\u2019m showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Shacey Petrovic. Shacey Petrovic : Great. Thank you all for joining us today. Insulet had a remarkable 2018 and we\u2019re set up for an even more remarkable future. I want to thank the Insulet team across the globe working to improve the lives of people with diabetes. 2019 will be another year of important milestones and exciting growth and we\u2019re looking forward to speaking with all of you again next quarter on our continued progress. Thanks, and have a great evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

Also, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Shacey. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Thanks, Deb, and good afternoon, everyone. Improving the lives of people with diabetes through our innovative technology is at the core of everything we do, and we made great progress with our innovation and other strategic imperatives during the quarter. In the first quarter of 2019, we continued our strong growth trajectory coming out of 2018 which was a year of tremendous execution and foundation building for long-term sustainable and profitable growth. Our transition to profitability and our significant progress on the strategic imperatives position us for continued operational and financial success over the near and long-term. We are accelerating on many fronts including the start-up of our highly automated U.S. manufacturing, our Omnipod DASH U.S. full market release, and the corresponding shift to a pay-as-you-go model. These major accomplishments were years in the making and they are coming to fruition while driving total revenue growth of 29% in the first quarter. And the total diabetes product line with the benefit of our direct operations in Europe grew over 30%. Our growth rate confirms we are successfully converting multiple daily injection users to Omnipod and given our low penetration into the global Type 1 diabetes market and even lower penetration into the insulin dependent Type 2 market, Insulet has a uniquely long runway for growth. Today, we believe Omnipod users account for low single digit percent of the total global insulin dependent user population. To achieve our 2021 revenue target of $1 billion it requires us to move to mid-single digits penetration of this available market. We have multiple levers to drive this growth, global expansion, innovation like Omnipod DASH which helped us grow further into both the Type 1 and Type 2 insulin dependent diabetes market, and our Omnipod Horizon automated insulin delivery system, which will be a game changer for people with Type 1 diabetes. We're off to a terrific start in 2019 having entered the year in a position of strength. On today's call, I'll review progress on our strategic imperatives and provide financial highlights from the first quarter. And then, I'll turn the call over to Wayde, who joins us for his first official call as CFO of Insulet. Wayde will provide further details on our financial results and share an update to our 2019 guidance. And then, we'll open the call for questions. Before I cover our financial and strategic highlights, I'll start by saying what an exciting day this was for Insulet. This morning, we held our ribbon cutting ceremony to officially commemorate the opening of our new worldwide headquarters and U.S. manufacturing facility. We were joined by our keynote speaker, Massachusetts Governor, Charlie Baker; State Senator Jamie Eldridge; town of Acton officials; Podders from around the country and many of our dedicated employees. It was a wonderful morning celebrating this important accomplishment and Insulet's exciting future. In a few minutes, I'll provide an update on the progress we're making getting our new highly automated manufacturing lines up and running. Moving on to the Q1 financial summary, in the first quarter of 2019 we delivered approximately $160 million in revenue exceeding our guidance and representing a 29% increase year-over-year. We drove gross margin to 67% a 550-basis-point improvement from one year ago. And our strong performance resulted in another profitable quarter and a great start to the year. We made important progress throughout the quarter advancing our strategic imperatives to expand market access, to accelerate product and business model innovation, to grow our global footprint, and to drive operational excellence. Ensuring more people have access to our products continues to be a top priority. During the first quarter of 2019, we expanded coverage for an additional 5 million Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries bringing our total coverage to greater than one-third of all Medicare lives and over half of all Medicaid lives. We also continue to secure coverage for our recently launched platform, Omnipod DASH. We ended 2018 with approximately 100 million covered lives for DASH with the majority through the pharmacy channel. And by the end of Q1 we expanded that coverage to an impressive 130 million covered lives. And just recently we secured distribution through Cardinal Health, one of the largest wholesalers in the country to complement our established and expanding pharmacy distribution network. Looking ahead, we continue to believe that market access expansion and business model innovation through the pharmacy channel provides a pathway for sustained growth. We are leveraging this broad coverage position with our launch of DASH mainly through the pharmacy channel. Our pay-as-you-go model is a clear differentiator and will continue to be a key driver of strong performance in the United States. It also provides several competitive and strategic advantages for us as well as for Omnipod patients, providers and payers. Unlike traditional insulin pumps, DASH does not lock patients in to a four year commitment and it is the only insulin pump with no upfront cost to get started. This means we have removed major barriers to adoption for new users. Customers can now adopt a new technology like DASH without having to wait until their lock-in period has expired. And on the payer side, we have reduced the risk and cost of member attrition because there is zero upfront cost for Omnipod DASH. We already have thousands of people who have placed pre-orders for DASH and we are laser-focused on expanding coverage, so all of these individuals will have access to our exciting technology. Customer feedback on the DASH product has been terrific, but we know in our business that just as important as terrific technology is seamless and capable customer support. During our limited market release we built critical new competencies, such as automated integration with our specialty pharmacy partners, online ordering for DASH, and the ability through the appeals process to assist patients who don't already have DASH coverage. These efforts required significant investments of time, resources and capability building. And while that process was complex, the customer experience should be simple. As a result of these investments, we are now in a much stronger position to ensure our customers have the best patient experience. There is great enthusiasm and demand for DASH and we will continue to build capabilities and access as we launch into the market. We could not be more excited to be delivering the DASH next generation mobile platform to our customers, and we look forward to their benefiting from this remarkable product and business model innovation. As the market research predicted, DASH has shown high satisfaction rates among people living with Type 1 and insulin dependent Type 2 diabetes. In fact, the Type 2 customer segment expressed enthusiasm for DASH's ease of use in particular the CalorieKing food library and easy to set temp basal profile. We believe DASH and its pay-as-you-go and pharmacy advantages will be very appealing to people living with insulin dependent Type 2 diabetes, thanks to the system's zero upfront cost model and its unparalleled simplicity and discretion. As they come to market, our concentrated insulin program can help us further penetrate this segment. We successfully completed you U-500 summative human factor study and expect to submit U-500 to the FDA in the next few weeks. In the United States where we have the best visibility, we believe the insulin dependent Type 2 diabetes population is at least as big if not bigger than the Type 1 diabetes market, and innovations like DASH and concentrated insulin can help drive more Omnipod adoption among this population. We continue to make important progress on our innovation roadmap with our Omnipod Horizon automated insulin delivery system. Our system provides even further ease of use and glycemic control with both on-body hybrid closed loop and personal smartphone control. According to recent market research by Seagrove Partners, a large percentage of respondents said they would switch to Horizon making it the single biggest winner as a standalone product. The data further supports that our patch pump design with phone control is the best embodiment of an automated insulin delivery system. Omnipod Horizon will be game changing. We are making great progress with our Horizon clinical development work and remain on track to start pivotals in the fourth quarter of this year and bring our technology to market in the second half of next year. We are so proud to be leading the way in leveraging consumer technology to provide meaningful innovation for our customers. Also from a clinical perspective, we once again will have a large presence at the American Diabetes Association show next month with seven clinical abstracts accepted. These presentations will report positive outcomes for Horizon including improved timing range and glycemic control and examine use in preschool children ages 2 to 6. ADA presentations will also include real world data on long term clinical outcomes from over 20,000 Omnipod users, which further support the benefits of our Omnipod System. Lastly, from an innovation perspective, we continue to support Tidepool's development effort focused on getting an open source, iOS-based loop app and algorithm approved by the FDA. We are collaborating to enable Omnipod to be an FDA-approved component of the Tidepool Loop automated insulin delivery system. This is additive to our internal Omnipod Horizon program and is a wonderful way to support the DIY community who have a strong desire for this advanced technology. We understand members of the community are already using loop technology off-label. And while we cannot condone off-label use, we certainly understand and empathize with the community's strong desire and sense of urgency for this technology. It is a compelling indication of significant market demand and it is precisely why we are supporting the Tidepool program and investing so significantly to get Horizon to market as quickly as possible. In addition to our innovation efforts, we are also investing in our global footprint. Our direct model has been in place in Europe for 10 months now and our team has done an incredible job building Insulet's reputation and capabilities in our European markets. We are already seeing this positively reflected in our best-in-class Net Promoter Score. Since taking over direct operations, we have seen a sizeable increase in our already market-leading Net Promoter Score, a testament to the strength of our European team. And now that we are closer to the customers and to the markets we serve, we are gaining meaningful insights into user preferences that will help drive innovation, commercialization and strong operational performance. We have made a significant investment to build our international capabilities including among others our European-based regulatory, market access, advocacy, distribution and customer support functions. We are now very well positioned to drive deeper into our existing markets and ultimately to expand into new geographies where we see tremendous opportunities for growth. We are currently just in a handful of countries outside the United States and we know there is long-term strategic value in expanding our international presence. Building on the strategy we are successfully executing in Europe, we intend to continue to focus on the significant opportunities in our existing markets during 2019 and then to shift to expanding our global footprint in 2020. There is enthusiastic interest from numerous markets to have Omnipod available and we are evaluating those opportunities as part of a thoughtful expansion strategy. We have multiple catalysts for accelerated growth and expansion throughout the globe. Lastly, I want to touch on our operational excellence and manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. which, in addition to our operations in China, lay the foundation for our ability to meet a rapidly growing demand. Over the next two years or over the last two years we have invested in sophisticated custom designed automation for U.S. manufacturing. I am so thrilled to report that we have successfully begun producing Omnipod at our new U.S. facility and our early experience validates our expectation that one highly automated U.S. line will produce up to 50% of the capacity of all of our lines in China with up to 90% less head count. This provides redundancy in our supply chain and will drive further cost reduction. We are on track to install our second line in our Massachusetts facility later this year which will further support our rapid growth. All of this plays a key role in driving continued margin expansion and value creation, while cementing Insulet's position as a global leader in the industry. With that, I will turn the call over to Wayde to discuss our financials in greater detail. Wayde McMillan - Insulet Corp.: Thank you, Shacey. Before I turn to the financials, I'd like to take a moment to say how delighted I am to speak with you as CFO of Insulet at this exciting moment in the company's evolution and to share a couple initial observations. First, it's clear that the passion our employees have for improving the lives of people with diabetes is at the heart of all we do, and exists at every level in the organization. We are making a real difference in the lives of those who use our products. Second, we have significant advantages with our technology and differentiation with the pay-as-you-go model in the pharmacy, which is disrupting old market paradigms. The progress to-date is impressive, and I look forward to working with the team here at Insulet and continuing to capitalize on the significant market opportunities we have in front of us. Now on to our first quarter financial results, as Shacey mentioned, we delivered another quarter of strong performance with total revenue of $159.6 million representing growth of $36 million or 29% which was $3.6 million above the high end of our guidance range of $152 million to $156 million. By product line, U.S. Omnipod revenue grew 23% to $86.1 million, which was $2.1 million above the high end of our guidance range, and represented the majority of our total guidance overachievement. International Omnipod revenue of $56.9 million grew 48% achieving the high end of our guidance range. And Drug Delivery revenue was $16.6 million, delivering 11% growth, which was $1.6 million above the high end of our expectations resulting from an increased order from our largest customer in the last month of the quarter. Turning to gross margin, we once again drove significant expansion reaching 66.9%, up 550 basis points and in line with our expectations. This expansion resulted from the incremental benefit of our successful transition to direct operations in Europe last year, as well as considerable productivity and cost improvements we continue to realize in our purchasing, manufacturing and supply chain operations. Our operating expenses were in line with our expectations and we ended the first quarter with operating income of $7.3 million representing 4.6% of revenue and net income of $4.4 million representing 2.7% of revenue. We ended the quarter with $393 million in cash and investments compared to $430 million at the end of last year. This use of cash was driven primarily by planned capital expenditures as we continue to invest in our U.S. manufacturing and supply chain operations. In summary, we were on a strong growth trajectory coming out of 2018 and we're seeing that momentum continue in our Q1 financial performance. We feel well-positioned for another year of growth and profitability. Next, I'll provide an update on our 2019 guidance. As a result of our first quarter performance, for the full year, we are raising our total revenue guidance. We now expect 2019 total revenue in the range of $667 million to $690 million representing growth of 18% to 22%. This compares to our previous expectation of $662 million to $687 million, or growth of 17% to 22%. By product line, we're raising our U.S. Omnipod revenue range to $376 million to $385 million, representing growth of 16% to 19%, up from our previous expectation of $373 million to $383 million, or 15% to 18%. For International Omnipod, we now expect revenue in the range of $236 million to $244 million, representing growth of 37% to 42%, which is unchanged. We continue to strengthen our capabilities and capitalize on our opportunity for growth in our existing markets. As a reminder, we launched our go direct strategy in Europe in the second half of last year, and as a result, we will have higher revenue growth in the first half of this year, as compared to last year. We continue to expect a more normalized second half growth rate of mid-teens to low 20% in our existing markets. Lastly, for Drug Delivery, based on our first quarter overachievement, we're raising our revenue range to $55 million to $61 million, representing an 11% to 19% decline. For the second quarter, we are introducing total revenue guidance of $160 million to $165 million, representing growth of 29% to 33%. This includes U.S. Omnipod revenue of $89 million to $91 million, representing growth of 14% to 17%. As a reminder, in Q2, we are working through both our first new product launch in some time with the full market release of Omnipod DASH in the U.S., as well as the shift in our business model to pay-as-you-go in the pharmacy, all of which requires significant new capabilities, systems, and processes. A key component for our differentiated pay-as-you-go model is the no-charge PDM, which presents a temporary headwind and is included in our Q2 revenue guidance. We expect International Omnipod revenue of $57 million to $59 million, representing growth of 100% to 107%. This growth reflects the last quarter of incremental benefit from converting our channel to direct from distribution in Europe. This benefit is comprised of an approximate 50% uplift in revenue in our European business, now that we have direct operations, as well as a favorable comparison to the negative impact in Q2 of last year, as we transitioned from our former European distributor. And last, we expect Drug Delivery revenue of $14 million to $15 million, representing a decline of 15% to 21%. For the rest of the P&L, our guidance remains unchanged. We expect our 2019 full-year gross margin to be relatively consistent with last year, reflecting the benefit of changing our business model in Europe and continued operating and supply chain improvements, offset by temporary headwinds from the ramp of our U.S. manufacturing. Therefore, we expect that Q2 gross margin, with a partial quarter impact of our U.S. manufacturing ramp, will be sequentially lower. We also expect second half of the year gross margin to be lower than Q2, due to the continued ramp of U.S. manufacturing. For operating expenses, we expect to increase approximately 20% due to continued investments in our innovation pipeline, and to remain relatively consistent as a percentage of revenue. We expect to deliver full-year operating margin in the mid-single-digit percentage range, and we expect capital expenditures to be relatively consistent with 2018, as we continue to invest in U.S. manufacturing to drive redundancy, cost reductions, and contributions to our margin expansion over the long term. In summary, we started the year delivering a strong first quarter of revenue growth and profitability, an indicator of the sound execution of our strategy. Given our solid foundation and positive momentum, we believe that we are well-positioned for continued growth and profitability throughout 2019, and remain on track to deliver our 2021 financial goals of $1 billion in revenue, gross margin of 70%, and operating margin in the mid-teens. Now, I'll turn the call back to Shacey. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Thanks, Wayde. It's great to have you on the team. I would like to reiterate Wayde's excitement about the opportunities ahead for Insulet, as we continue to build on our momentum and execute our strategic imperatives, we are focused on expanding our addressable market, investing in innovation, and growing our international footprint, all while demonstrating operational excellence and driving significant top and bottom line growth. We have the right roadmap in place for long-term growth and superior financial performance, which we are confident will drive significant shareholder value creation. Now, I'd like to turn the call back to the operator to open for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from JP McKim with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. JP McKim - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the questions. I wanted to start first with the pharmacy. Is the right way to think about it, like that adding 30 million lives a quarter, or could it be lumpy here and there? And then, maybe, Shacey, just early innings of your limited market release in Q1, did you see that \u2013 I don't want to say the acceleration in new adds, but did you see that demand from patients, given the low upfront costs, or any way you can quantify or qualitatively talk to that? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. Yeah. So in terms of DASH access, I think you could assume it's going to be somewhat lumpy. There are still a few large plans out there that we're working on. So those could be significant adds, and we will continue to build that access throughout the year. So \u2013 but we feel great about having 130 million covered lives. It's a really strong position to move into coverage for DASH. So that's great. In terms of the early experience about customer adoption and kind of where we're at with the no-charge PDM, just a couple pieces of color on that. The first is that Q1 was another record quarter for us in terms of new patient starts. And so the great thing about this is that we haven't seen any type of slowdown in demand as we neared the full market release for DASH. And I think that's a testament to the strength of the business model, that people know that they can get on to Omnipod, and as soon as they have access to DASH, they'll be able to access that technology without any delay. And then we're kind of in the early innings of our full market release for DASH. But as I said in my prepared remarks, we've got a great pipeline, thousands of patients that have already preordered the product really with no promotion, right? Because we moved into full market release at the end of Q1 to supply the channel, and we're just starting to ramp promotion now, so we feel like we're in a good spot. JP McKim - Piper Jaffray & Co.: That's helpful. And then could I ask one on just Horizon and Loop? Like, for example, Loop's already started their trial, and so if Loop gets approved for Horizon, could you launch a closed-loop system with Loop first and Horizon second, or is there something you'd have to do on your end first? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. We \u2013 I mean, one of the reasons \u2013 there were many reasons to partner with Tidepool, but one of the reasons was that they had potentially a faster pathway to market, if they were able to get the FDA to agree to their clinical strategy, and so we are prepared to kind of capitalize on whichever product makes it to market first, and we do see value in both programs. JP McKim - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. Thank you. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. Thanks, JP. Operator : Our next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Congrats on the quarter, and, Wayde, welcome. I'm glad you got out of that other company, got out alive. But anyway, just a couple quick questions here for me on just the U.S. business. So you initially, Shacey, discussed for the second quarter, you thought you'd see a headwind from pharmacy and DASH. I think you said $6 million to $8 million for the year, but I sort of look at the second quarter guide, and it's actually pretty stable on momentum basis. So I'm just sort of wondering, is $6 million to $8 million still the headwind you see for the year, and what could that be in the second quarter, or are you seeing less of a headwind, or more specifically, just better underlying demand helping you to sort of offset that pressure in the second quarter? Wayde McMillan - Insulet Corp.: Yeah, hey, David. Thank you, and thanks for the comment. It's great to be here. Yeah, so we are still holding the estimate from last quarter, which is expecting a unfavorable PDM revenue of about $6 million to $8 million in this year because of the pay-as-you-go model, where we have the no-charge PDM. So in other words, we recognized revenue last year for the PDM; this year, we will not. For some of our PDM sales, some will still be sold through the traditional channels, but for those that are under the pay-as-you-go model, it will be a no-charge PDM. And so we still think it will be $6 million to $8 million. What we also said was that it will be neutral for the year. And so what that means is, as we ramp our (sic) pay-as-you-go model, we will have no-charge PDMs, and those will start here in Q2 and will start to ramp. The benefit of moving customers into the pharmacy channel will start to accrue. And as that customer base builds, the benefit of that will start to offset the no-charge model, and eventually become a tailwind for us. And so the more customers that we get on the pay-as-you-go model, we'll have more of a headwind upfront from the PDM, but it will be overall good for our business, because over the long term, that will be a favorable impact for us. So hopefully that answers the question, David. David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And just (00:30:43), so it sounds like underlying demand must be a little better in the second quarter, for second quarter momentum is stable. And then I'll ask my second just for Shacey, the U-500 update, we're sort of assuming second half 2020 for U-500 clearance, is that a decent estimate? And then you kind of reiterate your timelines around Horizon. Can we think about 2021 as a full commercial launch for Horizon, or is that going to be a kind of a scaled commercial launch in the first half of 2021? Thanks so much. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. Those are great questions. So first of all, on your first comment, I think you can look at the bump in guidance in the U.S. as a sign that we feel really good about the momentum and strength of the business in the U.S. So I would concur with you on that. As it relates to U-500, we have probably a little bit more aggressive estimate in terms of potential FDA clearance there, so \u2013 but I don't think it really matters, David, because it's not a material impact from a revenue perspective, it's a pretty niche population. We are excited about being able to offer the product to the market, but it won't really move the needle from a revenue standpoint. And then the last question was about Horizon and full market release. We're actually evaluating that now, how do we actually get to use the clinical study potentially as a way to test some of the things that we would do in a normal limited market release to get to full market release more quickly. So, we'll give you more color on that as we kind of get closer to the FDA approval date and through the pivotal studies. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson with Baird. Your line is open. Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Shacey, I guess just to focus a little more on DASH, I apologize for that, but we've been hearing rumor that DASH had moved into DME as well; I'm not sure exactly the mechanics of how that would work, but it does seem like there's some verbiage on your website on the DASH website about DME as well. So is any of that increase from 100 million to 130 million lives driven by DME, and just if it is, do we have to conceptually, from our side of the table, think about that any differently than a pharmacy-based relationship? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Hey, actually, I'm glad you asked that question, because I think it gives us an opportunity to just sort of clarify. We look at two advantages to DASH, and they're not \u2013 in some cases, they overlap, and in some cases, they don't. So, one advantage is the pharmacy channel, that's a really attractive channel for us, an attractive channel for patients, and attractive channel for physicians, because it's efficient, there's less hurdles, it's really easy and a good customer experience for our patients, and for us, it's a more financially attractive channel. And so we are using DASH to really move into the pharmacy channel. But the pay-as-you-go strategy is sort of somewhat separate, and really could apply \u2013 we think it applies perfectly to the pharmacy channel, but it also can apply to the DME channel. So, I think the verbiage you're referring to on our website just would indicate that if a DME provider \u2013 and I think we have already disclosed that United is one of these \u2013 if a DME provider is willing to transfer the value of the PDM into the Pod and move to this pay-as-you-go model, then we are certainly willing to partner with them and contract with them. So, yes, it will be available in both channels. However, today, the vast majority of that is pharmacy and the vast majority of the additional lives because we had already secured United are pharmacy. Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: All right. That's helpful. And as a follow-up I guess to that, and maybe this is a better question for the DME providers, but I would assume they have a vested interest in being interested in doing that. I mean, if pharmacy is so much easier, if you prefer pharmacy, I'd assume physicians prefer it, patients probably prefer it, I would assume there's going to be a secular move towards pharmacy for DASH. Wouldn't the DME guys just looking out for their own skin want to be able to offer that and not lose that business to a pharmacy model? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: I think it's a good question for the DME providers. I mean, United is a great example of a payer who did that, but there's other reasons to put the product in pharmacy, we're obviously designated as a Part B product, and so we'll see how that plays out. I think what we feel good about is that the coverage is strong and growing. And so that, to us, is just a really strong indicator that we're going to be able to transition the business to pay-as-you-go and primarily in the pharmacy, both of which, as Wayde said earlier, are just really good for us. So, in a perfect world, to me, we'd have the vast majority of the business going through the pay-as-you-go model, and secondarily, in the pharmacy. Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Fair enough. Thank you. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Margaret Kaczor with William Blair. Your line is open. Brandon Vazquez - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi, everyone. This is Brandon on for Margaret. Congrats on a good quarter and good start to the year. I just wanted to focus first on kind of the DASH and pharmacy coverage. You mentioned there's 130 million lives covered now. Can you just clarify, one, the breakdown between the commercial coverage within the pharmacy channel and then Medicare/Medicaid? And then, two, just how is that tracking with your expectations so far into the year? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. So we don't share that detail in terms of the breakdown, but I will say it's a combination of Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial. And I would say at this point, we're tracking at or slightly ahead of our expectations in terms of coverage. So we feel really good about that. And I think the thing I always like to take the opportunity to remind everybody is that it's a great position for us to be in, because if we were launching just through the DME channel, and just leveraging our existing contracts, 100% \u2013 we may be able to convert a larger percentage, call it, 90% of people would have access to it, but they would all be stuck in that four-year lock-in period. And so really, only a small percentage of them would be able to access DASH until they waited out their warranty period. So we feel like this model, and this, I guess, somewhat disruption that we're causing as we kind of do these new contracts and establish this new channel and establish this new product, is worth the investment and the disruption, because as Wayde said, a long-term tailwind for us and also a great competitive advantage for the business. Brandon Vazquez - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. No, that's helpful and that makes sense. And as a follow-up to that, just taking kind of like a higher view of the market, it seems like I think the pump market historically has probably been like a high-single-digits growing market. But that said, it looks like you and maybe some of the other competitors, especially with advanced features, are maybe accelerating their growth recently. As we go into 2019, do you guys have any updated views on the market, and is it accelerating, do you anticipate it accelerating through this year? It seems like a lot of companies are getting the MDI patients come off the sidelines. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. Well, it's true that still today it's the vast majority, 75% of our business comes from multiple daily injections. So we are certainly helping to grow the overall pump market. And I would say that it does feel like the market is accelerating. I don't have \u2013 it's difficult to get great data on that, but you're right that historic estimates were that it would grow somewhere between 5% and 8%, and it does feel like it's accelerating. And I think it's just a testament to the fact that technology is getting better and people, especially with CGM, are just adopting technology at higher rates. Brandon Vazquez - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Robbie Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Two for me, first, can you help us get a sense of how you get comfortable around the Drug Delivery trajectory, considering what's happening in the market with generic entries and share moving to the biosimilars? And not just in 2019, because we have your guidance, but how do you think about this maybe over the next few years, and is there any other potential for more Drug Delivery options here? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. So both questions, I guess, are tied to Drug Delivery. So in terms of the trajectory of the business, I think we feel comfortable that there are plenty of levers for growth to meet our long term \u2013 both our long-term revenue and margin goals, so those 2021 stated goals, really kind of regardless of what happens with the Drug Delivery benefit because it's \u2013 or Drug Delivery trajectory because it's become a smaller component of our business, so we look to things like, for example, international expansion to help offset whatever risk there might be in a trajectory tied to Drug Delivery. That said, we continue \u2013 obviously it's not an area of the business that we give a lot of color on, because the development programs are long, but we do continue to have great activity in early exploratory work going on in that area. So, we don't have specific color to offer, except for that it's still an area of exploration for us. Robbie Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. And maybe as a follow-up, I was hoping you could just lay out for us some of the remaining timelines on Horizon, the development pathway, when we'll see the pivotal trial results, when you'll submit, what will actually be coming to market in late 2020, what that version of the product will look like, and then just your latest thoughts on the U200 timelines. Thanks. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. So I don't have an update on U200. But in terms of Horizon, the next milestone that everybody needs to look for is the pivotal. That pivotal trial will probably take us a few months to get through, and then we will consolidate that data and submit. I think you know, Robbie, as do many on the call, that we were designated as part of the Breakthrough Devices Program. And so we have a very collaborative, very frequent interaction with the FDA. So they review our clinical protocols, they review our strategy and our milestones on a regular basis. So we expect to benefit from an accelerated review process as a result of that designation. So I don't have more milestones to provide you beyond the fact that pivotals will happen at the end of this year, and those will likely go through the early part of 2020. And then we will consolidate that data and submit. In terms of how the launch might play out after that, I think I was mentioning that earlier, we are evaluating opportunities to be able to use the pivotal trial as somewhat of a limited market release. And some of that will depend on the access strategy and on the pricing strategy that we're kind of all working through. So I don't have a lot of color to offer you yet, but certainly as we get closer to submitting for pivotals, we'll continue to provide those updates. Robbie Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And just to confirm lastly here, we're still expecting a launch in the back half of 2020, or is that a different timeline now? Thanks a lot. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah, no, that's the same timeline. No changes there. Operator : Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with SVB Leerink. Your line is open. Danielle Antalffy - SVB Leerink LLC : Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question and congrats on a really good, and I would say, very clean quarter. Thank you for that. It's been a tough earnings season. So, first, just to follow up on the Type 2 commentary that you talked about on \u2013 in the prepared remarks, Shacey, can you talk about where you are, what percentage of your installed base today is Type 2? And I know you mentioned to David's question that U-500 is more of a niche market. It feels like U200 could be a much bigger market, how we could think about that growing over time once we do get the concentrated insulins on the market as well? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. Sure. Thanks, Danielle. I think the way to think about it is that the Type 2 insulin-dependent segment for us is going to grow. We believe that's going to grow, frankly, with or without concentrated insulins. Concentrated insulins are helpful, but what we've seen in terms of that segment's reaction to DASH, we believe that we've got a really nice pathway to continue to expand that population. It's approximately 15% of our U.S. business today, and it was actually about 15% of the DASH limited market release, too, which is why we got good visibility to that data and how they were sort of reacting to the DASH user experience, and it was just tremendous. So we feel really good that we have a product that's going to be very appealing to both people living with Type 1 and also insulin-dependent Type 2 diabetes. So I think you're right, in that U200 is the larger opportunity and could contribute more, but I think what we've seen is that, in fact, because Omnipod is reducing total daily dose of insulin by almost 20% in people living with Type 2, we actually have just a much larger opportunity there to grow that business even without concentrated insulins. Danielle Antalffy - SVB Leerink LLC : And... Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: So we are looking forward to U-500 and U200, but we won't wait for them to grow that business. Danielle Antalffy - SVB Leerink LLC : And just as a follow-up on that, does the move to the pharmacy actually help you access the insulin-dependent Type 2 market? I mean, could you talk about how coverage is there for insulin pumps, are there any barriers you need to knock down from that perspective, and what you're doing to knock those down? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. So that's actually the great news. And one of the reasons why I alluded to the fact that it's likely that that segment will really appreciate the pharmacy channel, because the actual barriers to coverage, particularly for people living with Type 2 insulin-dependent diabetes, are much lower or in fact non-existent relative to the DME channel. So just one example is the C-peptide test, which is a requirement in the DME Medicare channel and is not a requirement in the Medicare pharmacy Part D channel. So, we feel actually good that we're in a really strong position. It's one of the strategic benefits of kind of building out the pharmacy channel is the great coverage for people who \u2013 all people who require insulin on a daily basis, not just Type 1s. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Your line is open. Jayson Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good afternoon. Just a couple quick ones for me, with the full market release of DASH, logistically, does this mean that every new user gets DASH? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Well, it's access-dependent. So every new user that has access and wants it can get it. But obviously, we've got 130 million covered lives. So that's about 33%, 35% of all covered lives. And so that's about the segment, I would guess, of new patients that will have access to DASH. Jayson Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. That's fair. And then just secondly, you mentioned securing distribution with Cardinal as you launch DASH. It doesn't seem like this in the guidance, but are there stocking orders implied just to fill the channel? Is that contemplated in the 2Q guidance at all? Wayde McMillan - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. Hi, Jayson. So working with \u2013 through this with our teams right now, we're not expecting a significant amount of channel build in Q2. However, it is something we're monitoring very closely. So, not in Q2, and we're working with the teams to understand it as we work through this new channel. And if we do see it, we'll be sure to let you know. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ravi Misra with Berenberg Capital. Your line is open. Ravi Misra - Berenberg Capital Markets LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So just this one on the pharma versus DME kind of patient pull-through, and then I have a follow-up. So, as you're getting more and more exposure to this pharma channel, I'm just curious, what kind of patient is coming to that \u2013 is coming that way? Is it the kind of the MDI newbie, or is it your existing pump users who have come off warranty and now they have an easier way to access it? Any detail there would be appreciated. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: It's a great question. And I'd \u2013 actually, Ravi, I don't have color to offer that to you kind of in front of me. I will say that at a high level, the patient mix hasn't changed. So we don't have a change in the number of patients coming from pumps versus MDI, still today, about 75% of our patients come to us from multiple daily injections versus pumps. Ravi Misra - Berenberg Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And just do you have any expectations of that, how that plays out in the future? And then kind of my follow-up is, just with the DASH ordering, it sounds like it's making easier obviously for the patient to receive the technology. How is that playing through then kind of on the P&L, are we seeing that, was that kind of factoring in in some of the G&A leverage that we saw in the quarter, and how do we think of that going forward? Thank you. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure. I'd just \u2013 I'll quickly answer the first, and let Wayde weigh in on the second. So we don't have expectations in the plan that the mix of patients coming from pumps versus MDI will change in the pharmacy relative to the DME. So we fully expect to continue to stick with our strategy, which is to convert MDI users. Wayde McMillan - Insulet Corp.: No, thanks, and on the question of leverage, so not yet. So, one of the things that we have had to invest in is being able to support the new move into the pharmacy channel, while we kept the investment for our other direct and DME businesses. And so we do expect over time, given that it's a more efficient model, but as we scale, we'll be able to reduce the investment on the traditional side of the business and ramp more efficiently on the pharmacy side, but that certainly does not have an impact on the current quarter, and we probably won't see that for some time, given that we still have to support the base business in our traditional channels. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Matt Taylor with UBS. Your line is open. Matthew Taylor - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Thank you for taking the question. So, the first one I wanted to ask was \u2013 is a relatively simple question, you talked a lot about how your access has expanded over the course of the last year in Medicare, Medicaid and with some of the commercial. And I was wondering if you could help us by trying to quantify how that access expansion has impacted your results, or if you could just provide some color what percentage of patients or something like that are coming through Medicare or any of those channels? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: I don't have specific numbers to provide, only to say that, I think I have now said three calls running that we have had record new patients start quarters \u2013 three or four calls running now. And I think that is a direct result of the impact of market access. And so we certainly have started to see for example our age group in the Medicare age group increase more significantly and contribute more significantly to new patient starts and likely also to retention. So I don't have a sense of what percentage is it contributing, but it is definitely driving outsized performance in new patient starts. Matthew Taylor - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then I just wanted to follow up on some of the questions here about DASH. I think if there's one thing that some investors are concerned about is that the PDM loss may cause you to have an air pocket. And so I was wondering if you could talk to us about how you've thought about the pacing of the $6 million to $8 million in developing your second quarter guidance, and how much control do you have over which patients go on to DASH by how you release it or how you promote it to be able to try and hit the target through the year. Wayde McMillan - Insulet Corp.: Okay, good. Hey, Matt. It's Wayde. So the $6 million to $8 million as we mentioned before from a pacing standpoint, we think it's pretty consistent across the quarters of the year. As we move into the DASH release here, we're assuming that it will be more in Q2, Q3 and Q4 certainly than it was in Q1. And you know the thing I think is important to know is that you know our PDM revenue is a small percentage of our total revenue. And so, the headwind from last year even if we didn't have any PDM revenue in other words if we were successful and had all customers move to the pay-as-you-go model, it would probably be slightly outside of our guidance range, but it wouldn't be that significant. And so, we think we've captured the right amount in our guidance for Q2. It's one of the reasons why it's ticked down a little bit from our annual run rate from the prior year at 19%. And we think that once we get more customers on the pay-as-you-go model and we start to accrue the benefit from that, it becomes neutral and eventually becomes a tailwind for us. So I don't think I would make a huge deal out of that and so \u2013 just given that it's a pretty small percentage of our revenue overall. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Suraj Kalia with Northland Securities. Your line is open. And it looks like Suraj's line has disconnected. Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen. You line is open. Ryan Blicker - Cowen and Company : Hi. This is Ryan on for Doug. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just coming back to patient starts, you mentioned another quarter of record new starts in the U.S. Just to be clear, does that mean an absolute record across any quarter meaning you added more new patients in Q1 than you did in Q4 or specifically a record for any historical Q1? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. Great. Thank you for clarifying that. It's a record for any historical Q1. Ryan Blicker - Cowen and Company : Okay, and is it fair to assume that historically your new patient adds in the U.S. have historically been seasonal in the U.S., typical to overall revenues, just trying to make that clear because that would be a pretty impressive acceleration if that is typically the case. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah, that's right. So, we did actually have a stronger Q1 by quite a bit, but it is true that Q1 is our seasonally lightest quarter. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Suraj Kalia with Northland Securities. Your line is open. Suraj Kalia - Northland Securities : Can you guys hear me all right? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yes, got you. Suraj Kalia - Northland Securities : That's perfect. So, Shacey, forgive me multiple earnings calls going on and forgive me if somebody has already asked these questions. I heard something about forward-looking at least to the overall market on insulin pumps. I understand your answer from a strategic perspective, but I'm curious if you can shed some color on a tactical basis. Tandem also essentially has a lunar (00:54:04) trajectory on its pump placements. When we look at it on a tactical basis let's say Insulet and Medtronic and Tandem now, can you give us some color how is the hand-to-hand combat on the ground? I'm really curious, is this something \u2013 there seems to be a ground shift. Obviously, all the companies are putting in tremendous amount of R&D effort. But more so, how does the decision process work, if Suraj comes in, how is he choosing between Tandem t :slim versus 670G versus Omnipod, anything there on a tactical basis would be greatly appreciated. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure, Suraj. So, I think it's a fair question. So, first I'll say it's very, I guess, challenging or difficult to compare the growth rates because the business models are very different, so I just want to make sure that we're all clear, right. They take four years of revenue upfront and we've got this recurring revenue model, and so challenging to kind of compare those growth rates. It's also by the way \u2013 I also think the CGM integration is a big piece of what's driving, for example, Tandem's growth trajectory which is kind of why we're so excited about DASH, which gives CGM light integration and Horizon. But what we understand and what we hear from clinicians is that Omnipod is differentiated for MDI users, who don't want to move to a tube pump, who they would not otherwise have adopted a tube pump and that's supported by data that we get on a quarterly basis of our new patient starts where 66% of them now tell us that they would not be on pump therapy if not for Omnipod. So we really do believe that they are distinct segments and that we're helping to grow the overall population. That said, I think we should all acknowledge that we're kind of coming up on the innovation curve too as it relates to CGM integration and it's one of the reasons why the business model shift was so strategic for us because if we now enable patients to be able to move to our new technologies like DASH and Horizon when they want without having to wait out their four-year period, as we bring these innovations to market like DASH and like Horizon will really enable people to kind of adopt those as they want to. So both are important to us, to continue to invest in innovation and also this business model move that enables us to drive growth as we bring innovation to market at the cadence that we bring innovation to market. Suraj Kalia - Northland Securities : Fair enough, Shacey. And I'll keep it one follow-up and thank you for taking my question. In our discussions with clinicians, Shacey, a couple of comments were made that piqued my curiosity. Essentially some of the payers, there seemed to be some discussions of moving towards monthly payment model and get away on this whole lump sum upfront model. Have you guys sensed any of that in the marketplace? I'd be very curious to get your perspective. Thanks for taking my question. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Sure, Suraj. And yes the answer is, I mean it's clearly demonstrated in why we're building access so quickly for DASH, it's because payers are really attracted to the pay-as-you-go model. So, you call that a per member per month fee or you just call that Omnipod, right. Both are the same in that they are pay-as-you-go models and they are risk adjusted for the payer because they're not flunking down thousands of dollars upfront, and then just hoping for patient compliance. It really eliminates that risk for the payer. And it's one of the main reasons outside of this other kind of innovation piece that I talked about that we moved to that model. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Steven Plachtyna - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi, this is Steve on for Joanne. Thanks for taking the question. Can you update us on DASH in Europe, just general timing, maybe which markets, will this have the same feature set as DASH in the U.S. and maybe any hints toward phone control internationally? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah, it's a great question, Steve. So, we do plan to bring DASH to Europe. We don't plan to do that in any substantive way until 2020 because we're only 10 months into that business and so we really wanted to make sure that the team and the business and all of our functions were well established before we brought new products into the mix in Europe. And the other reason is because one of the whole theses of going into Europe was to establish a direct presence there, so we can better understand what's the right configuration and the right go-to-market strategy for DASH in these various markets in Europe. So, what we know is there's great demand. We know that the configuration will be slightly different than what we see in the U.S. One example is there are different privacy requirements and frankly different value propositions tied to data and tied to apps, and so that may look different and we'll see where we go with that. But our plan is to have the product configurations and the market launch plan finalized by the end of this year, and we're also doing the work to do the translations for this year and we should be moving into limited market releases with DASH sometime in early 2020. Steven Plachtyna - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And then could you just give us your latest views on the ACE pump designation? Has your thinking evolved here, do you have plans to submit Horizon for FDA approval with an ACE designation. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah, we do believe we'll be taking advantage of that pathway. And so, we're not really in any hurry because it's tied to the Horizon clinical development pathway which has some runway yet and then also there is no other iCGM at this point and so there's not real advantage from that perspective. But it's a great, I think, avenue that we'll all want to take advantage of eventually. We reviewed the special controls and don't have any issues meeting the special controls. Operator : Thank you. The final question comes from Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. Your line is open. Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC : Hi, good evening. Wonder if Shacey, maybe if I could just ask a question on pharmacy, it's intriguing that you talk about the price uplift you get in that channel. And I'm curious, one, if you'll tell us what that is, and two, as you're expanding in that channel and signing up more pharmacies what the discussions look like and whether you're able to maintain that premium as you expand in that channel. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. Raj, nice try. We're not giving the price uplift, just suffice it to say that we have sort of transitioned the value of the PDM into the Pod price, and for that pharmacies are relatively open because we are eliminating a risk and an upfront cost for them. So, we haven't \u2013 obviously I think just the fact that we have established such strong access in a short period of time is just a testament to the fact that the value proposition works for the payer and the pharmacy. We're \u2013 obviously we feel good about our position. I don't think we would expect to give any guidance on pricing and kind of how we view the future there any time soon. But we do expect that segment of our business to grow. We expect to be a more attractive segment both from a top and bottom line. Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC : On the same lines I guess, as you expand in that channel and given that it is a more profitable I should say at least a higher revenue channel for you. Will you be disclosing the percentage of your patients or anything in terms of the mix in pharmacy, I imagine it's quite low now so it probably isn't meaningful, but as you get bigger, is that something you're going to share with us? Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Yeah. I think it's a good question because we obviously want to be able to give you guys some color around both pharmacy and DASH. DASH is a big piece of pharmacy. So we're looking at various things like maybe percentage of new patients in the pharmacy or percentage of the business in the pharmacy. We're still discussing what metrics we'll provide, but we're certainly committed to giving you guys some qualitative and where we can quantitative color on how DASH and pharmacy are going. So we'll figure that piece out. But the other thing just to be clear, the other thing that we \u2013 I have said is that, where the revenue growth and the customer base growth diverge, we will give that color. And that certainly did not happen this quarter or we would have given you that color. And going forward if that diverges because of the pricing model being different in the pharmacy, we will provide that color. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude today's question and answer session. I now would like to turn the call back over to Shacey Petrovic for any closing remarks. Shacey Petrovic - Insulet Corp.: Thank you and thank you all for joining us today. We're off to a great start this year and we are set up for a remarkable 2019 and an even brighter future. As always, I want to thank the Insulet team across the globe, working to improve the lives of people living with diabetes. We couldn't be more excited about the strong momentum we have throughout our business and that's very much down to the team and their execution. So we look forward to updating you again next quarter on our progress. Thank you and have a great evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mrs. Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Ma'am, please go ahead. Deborah Gordon : Thank you, Lauren. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for Insulet Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Call.

Also, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year GAAP basis. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Shacey. Shacey Petrovic : Thanks, Deb, and good afternoon everyone. The second quarter of 2019 was another important and exciting one for Insulet and we are extremely pleased to have made great progress on our strategic imperatives as we cross the midpoint of the year. We entered 2019 from a position of operational and financial strength after working throughout our 2018 to solidify our foundation for long-term sustainable and profitable growth. We remain focused on our strategic imperatives; first driving innovation across our business; Second, expanding market access; third: strengthening our global footprint and fourth ensuring operational excellence throughout our organization. Thanks to our disciplined focus and these imperatives and the team's great execution Insulet achieved another quarter of accelerated revenue growth. As a result, we are raising our full year 2019 guidance. Our market opportunity is large, it is growing and it is under-penetrated. Today, we estimate our addressable market in the countries we currently serve almost 10 million people living with Type 1 and insulin dependent Type 2 diabetes. Globally both the incidence of diabetes and the use of technology to manage the disease are growing. These trends provide strong tailwinds for our business. We have a number of near and long-term growth catalyst such as our new product innovation and global expansion which we expect will both increase our addressable market and our penetration into that market. These growth drivers will make us confidence in our 2021 financial targets and our ability to drive continued long-term growth. On today's call, I will share financial highlights from the quarter and review the progress on our strategic imperatives. I will then turn the call over to Wade, who will provide additional detail on our second quarter financial results and share an update to our 2019 outlook. We will then open the call for questions. In the second quarter, we delivered $177 million in revenue exceeding our guidance by $12 million at the high end and representing a 43% increase year-over-year. This was driven by 51% growth in our global diabetes revenue including the one-time benefit of our go-direct strategy in Europe. As we said last quarter after years in the making, we had a significant number of initiatives coming to fruition in Q2. Our team executed extremely well across all of them, resulting in our over achievement. We continue to make progress across our core strategic initiatives and remain laser focused on improving the lives of people living with diabetes. Starting with innovation and market access, since last quarter's full commercial launch of our next generation platform Omnipod DASH, we have had thousands of patients get started on DASH. Customer feedback has been superb and an internal survey of our first DASH users approximately 90% were very satisfied with the ease of use of DASH and would recommend DASH to a friend. The new DASH PDM was designed as a mobile app on a locked down Android phone. There is clear customer appreciation for how intuitive the user interface is and how Insulet has advanced towards our vision of customers being able to control their PODs from their personal smartphones DASH utilization is growing commensurate with our work to establish access and reimbursemen. By the end of Q2, we have expanded US coverage for DASH to approximately 50% of all covered lives. Also this quarter, more than a third of our new Omnipod customers received DASH and the vast majority of DASH was shipped through the pharmacy channel. We are working to continue to expand access in this channel because the pharmacy provides several advantages and a best-in-class customer experience for physicians, their patients and payers. Our focus on this channel is delivering results. We ended Q2 of 2019 with 15% to 20% of our total US customer base receiving their PODs through the pharmacy channel, up from 10% to 15% previously. There has been enthusiastic customer response and DASHis innovative pay-as-you-go business model. Omnipod DASH is the only insulin pump with no upfront charge and no four year lock-in period. We believe it is game changing to remove barriers to adoption for our stakeholders and these efforts should drive more use of Pod therapy. The patients who otherwise might not have afforded new technology because of upfront cost or industry lock in periods can now choose Omnipod. Because of its simplicity, low cost and low commitment, physicians can feel confident recommending Omnipod for more patients and earlier in the treatment pathway. And on the payer side, we have reduced the risk and cost of member attrition. There are early indications that our DASH strategy is paying off. US patient demand and new patient starts are at all time record highs . We have established significant market access in a relatively short period of time and physicians have told us they are now considering multiple daily injection users and Type 2 patients for DASH that they otherwise would not have recommended for pump therapy. Thanks to its simplicity, discretion and ease of use DASH is showing to be a particularly appealing and valuable technology for people living with insulin dependent Type 2 diabetes. We have launched messaging and educational initiatives to ensure that physicians and patients understand DASH is unique benefits for type 2 users and we expect this customer segment to continue to grow. In addition to broadening access to Omnipod DASH, we continue to successfully secure expanded coverage for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. By the end of this second quarter, we expanded coverage to greater than 50% of all Medicare lives up from just over one-third at the end of last quarter and we ended Q2 with coverage for approximately 60% of all Medicaid lives up from over half at the end of Q1. The foundation we are building in terms of leveraging our powerful business model building access in the pharmacy and moving Omnipod up the treatment pathway will all be advantageous for Omnipod Horizon when it launches next year. We are making great progress with Horizon's clinical and product development and remain on track to start pivotal in the 4th quarter of this year. Omnipod Horizon will improve glycemic control with both hybrid closed loop and personal smartphone control. Because Horizon's algorithm resides on the pod itself, users will benefit from an on-body, waterproof system that keeps them in closed-loop without having to disconnect daily for activities like bathing or exercise. This is a crucial differentiator from traditional tube pump. It means that the pod is always in direct communication with the CGM, Omnipod Horizon system architecture is designed to provide more time in loop and more time in range At June's, American Diabetes Annual Conference compelling data was presented on Omnipod Horizon in which study participants children, ages 2 through 6 were shown to spend significantly less time in hyperglycemia, spend significantly more time in the target glucose range and to have better overnight glycemic control compared to their usual therapy which included MDI and sensor-augmented pump therapy During the study, glucose control was maintained in the target range for 73% of the time overall and 85% of the time during the overnight period. This is remarkable given the many challenges of maintaining proper glycemic control for children this young and it is a powerful early indicator of the impact Horizon can have. We are aware of growing off label use of the loop algorithm and while we cannot condone or support it, we want to make sure that this system is well studied and safe and effective for a broad population of users. We are working with Tidepool to get the DIY communities iOS-based loop algorithm and automated insulin delivery system cleared by the FDA and commercially supported in the marketplace on Omnipod. This system, which will be accessed through the app store from a user's iPhone, provides yet another level of convenience to Insulin Management. This is additive to our internal Omnipod Horizon program and we are pleased to have the opportunity to support patient choice and the passionate and driven DIY community. In addition to product innovation and market access, we continue to focus on strengthening our global footprint and solidifying our leadership position outside of the United States where the addressable market is large and growing. Our direct operations in Europe has been in place for just over one year and as a result of the market insights we have gained through our direct engagement with stakeholders, we are increasing our penetration in existing markets. Some examples of the team successes include France where today the majority of all new patients starting pump therapy are choosing Omnipod. And the United Kingdom where approximately 20 clinics are now prescribing Omnipod regularly for the first time ever. We also have been awarded new tenders that are broadening access to Omnipod throughout our existing European markets. We are well positioned to drive continued growth in our existing markets to expand into new geographies where we see long-term, strategic value and additional opportunities for growth and to drive innovation including the launch of DASH in 2020. We will focus on the significant opportunities in our existing markets during 2019 and expect to begin to expand our global footprint in 2020. And finally, turning to operational excellence in our new US manufacturing. In the second quarter, we began production on our first highly automated US manufacturing line in Massachusetts. While this ramp is a headwind to gross margin, we expect to realize significant efficiencies and gross margin expansion over the long term given the lower landed cost of production. We remain on plan to install our second US manufacturing line later this year and begin production in 2020. This investment further supports our rapid growth, provides manufacturing redundancy and supports efficiency, efficient and effective technology transfer of our new product innovation into manufacturing. In summary, we made significant progress on our strategic imperatives including innovation, increasing market access, strengthening our global footprint and ensuring operational excellence throughout Insulet. This focus and the team's great execution delivered another record quarter of revenue dollar growth. In fact Q2 marked Insulet's fourth consecutive quarter of greater than 20% revenue growth and our fourth consecutive quarter of positive operating income and net income. With that I will now turn the call over to Wayde. Wayde McMillan : Thank you, Shacey. As Shacey noted at the beginning of the call, we had another strong quarter as we continue to execute across our strategic imperatives, We are realizing improved financial results each quarter by accelerating revenue growth profitably as we scale while remaining focused on carrying out our mission of improving the lives of people with diabetes through our innovative solutions. In the second quarter of 2019, we had revenue of $177.1 million representing growth of $52.9 million or 43% which was $12 million above the high end of our guidance range. By Product, line US Omnipod revenue grew 26% to $98.1 million which was $7 million above the high end of our guidance range. This was the third quarter in a row of accelerating growth in the US while managing the transition to pharmacy and the launch of a new product. This acceleration resulted from growth in our customer base driven by expanded market access and the launch of Omnipod DASH primarily through the pharmacy channel and the mix benefit of the premium from the shift to the pay-as-you-go model. In the quarter, we exceeded the high end of our guidance range because we are able to successfully navigate through the DASH launch and business model shift including a no-charge PDM. International Omnipod revenue grew 120% to $62.7 million exceeding the high end of our guidance range by $4 million primarily due to growing demand for Omnipod within our existing European markets and the benefit of our direct business model in Europe. As a reminder, Q2 international Omnipod revenue growth reflects the final quarter of the year-over-year incremental 50% uplift in price in our European business from converting to a direct model. Additionally, we had an easier comparison in Q2 due to the negative impact from the inventory buyback when we transition from our former European distributor in the prior year. Drug delivery revenue was $16.3 million, a reduction of 8% and $1 million above our expectations. Turning to gross margin, we delivered 65.7% in the second quarter down 30 basis points year-over-year and 120 basis points sequentially. As we communicated on the last quarter's earnings call, we guided to a sequential decline in gross margin in Q2 given the partial quarter impact of our US manufacturing ramp. As we increase production, we incur certain period costs including training and start-up costs as well as working through the normal inefficiencies of a new plant startup. We expect these headwinds to continue for some time as we add future manufacturing lines and established the first manufacturing facility and capabilities for Insulet. Operating expenses were 61.4% of revenue and increased 40% over prior year. R&D included an increase of 71.6% year-over-year as a result of accelerating investments in innovation and US manufacturing period expenses prior to starting production. We ended the quarter with operating income of $7.6 million representing 4.3% of revenue, in line with full year expectations and net income of $1.4 million representing just less than 1% of revenue. We ended the quarter with $372 million in cash and investments compared to $393 million at the end of the first quarter and $430 million at the end of last year, and we generated positive operational cash flow. We continue to use cash for planned capital expenditures as we invest in our US manufacturing and supply chain operations. In summary, we are pleased with the acceleration of revenue growth, level of investment and profitability in the quarter and we are confident this momentum will carry us through the second half of 2019. We are well positioned for continued revenue growth and profitability over the long term. Next, an update on our 2019 guidance. As a result of our strong first half of the year and anticipated momentum through the rest of 2019, we are raising our guidance expectations for the full year by $25 million at the high end of guidance and $33 million at the low end. We now expect 2019 total revenue in the range of $700 million to $750 million, representing growth of 24% to 27%. By product line, we are raising our US Omnipod revenue range to $391 million to $399 million representing growth of 21% to 23% up from our previous expectation of $376 million to $385 million. This reflects our confidence in the strong growth of our customer base given market access wins and record new patient starts. We're off to a great start with our recently launched Omnipod DASH product and this is fueling our already strong growth. We continue to expect a PDM headwind of $6 million to $8 million for the full year, resulting from our no cost DASH-PDM and expect us to neutralize during the year due to the mix benefit of new and existing users purchasing DASH pods at a slight premium. For international Omnipod, we are raising our revenue to a range of $246 million to $250 million representing growth of 43% to 45% up from our previous expectation of $236 million to $244 million, this includes the higher year-over-year revenue growth in the first half of the year, resulting from the Q2 2018 inventory buyback and our higher than expected customer base growth this past quarter. We continue to expect normalized growth for the year in the mid-teens to low 20% for our international product line. We're in a great position to capitalize on our strong growth in our existing markets given our direct European presence. Lastly for drug delivery, we are raising our revenue to a range of $63 million to $66 million representing a decline of 3% to 8%. This has improved from our previous expectation of $55 million to $61 million. For the third quarter of 2019, we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $174 million to $181 million representing growth of 15% to 20%. This includes US Omnipod revenue of $98 million to $102 million representing growth of 20% to 24%. We also expect international Omnipod revenue of $61 million to $63 million representing growth of 22% to 26%. Lastly, we expect drug delivery revenue of $15 million to $16 million representing a decline of 15% to 21%. For the rest of the P&L, we are reaffirming that we expect our full year 2019 gross margin to be relatively consistent with prior year. This reflects the benefit of going direct in Europe and continued operating and supply chain improvements and the mix benefit of the pay-as-you-go model, offset by headwinds from the ramp of establishing our US manufacturing. We further expect gross margin for the second half of the year to be lower than the first half due to the impact of the US manufacturing ramp, during the remainder of the year and into 2020. We also expect Q3 to be the lowest quarter in 2019 given the timing of period costs and ramp up within the year. As most of you are aware, we are developing a core competency within Insulet around operational excellence and best-in-class global manufacturing. It is a significant advantage to now have our own manufacturing operations, co-located with our innovation teams. Manufacturing a product of this complexity at scale is difficult to implement and also to replicate. We are managing through the early ramp process and remain confident we will scale to our planned production levels to continue to serve our growing customer base. We now expect 2019 operating expenses to increase approximately 25% up from our prior expectations of 20%. Our change in estimate is a result of our higher revenue expectations for the year resulting in the corresponding increase in associated variable costs and an opportunity to increase our investment in innovation. We still expect to deliver full-year operating margin in the mid single-digit percentage range and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be relatively consistent with 2018 as we invest in US manufacturing to drive redundancy, cost reductions and contributions to our margin expansion over the long term. To wrap up, we are proud of the team's successful execution of our strategy and the performance we delivered in the first half of 2019. Looking ahead to 2021, we remain confident in our targets of $1 billion in revenue, gross margin of 70% and operating margin in the mid-teens. We have the right strategy and momentum to achieve these goals and Insulet is well positioned to deliver long-term, sustainable growth and value creation. I'll now turn the call back to Shacey for her concluding remarks. Shacey Petrovic : Thanks, Wade. I speak on behalf of the entire team when I say that I am excited about the opportunities ahead for Insulet. Our financial out-performance in the first half of 2019 and continued execution of our proven strategy ensure we are in a great position to continue our strong track record of shareholder value creation. Now, I would like to turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jeff Johnson with Baird. Your line is open. Jeff Johnson : Thank you, guys, Good afternoon. Congratulations on the quarter and the quarter back news I guess. So two questions here, one just on the mix of patients in the quarter, Shacey are you seeing any increased mix T2? Obviously a little bit easier through the pharmacy channel to get a T2 coverage with DASH, so any change there or any change on competitive wins versus MDI conversions? Shacey Petrovic : Yes, I think it's a great question, Jeff. So the rate of competitive wins from MDI versus 2 pumps pretty steady. So still approximately 80% of our new patients coming from multiple daily injections while we have started to see some early indications of what I think is could turn into an exciting trend is the tight 2 mix in our new patient starts on DASH. So there we have started to see a tick up and it's too early really to call it a trend but I think we are encouraged that our messaging and our focus on that population is starting to resonate with physicians and with users. Jeff Johnson : All right , that's helpful and then Wayde maybe a manufacturing question for you, I don't want to read between the lines too much on some of your comments but are we see in anything where manufacturing costs maybe a little bit higher than initially expected or would you say the start-up in the ramp-up costs are pretty much right in line kind of with how you were thinking. And just to make sure what percentage of your US demand can you service out of the US manufacturing facility over the next 6 months to 12 months or I don't think there's any tariff issues to consider but I just want to confirm that? Thank you. Wayde McMillan : You bet. Hi Jeff. So, regarding manufacturing costs, they are right in line with our expectations. We have not changed our guidance for gross margin since the beginning of the year. And so very much in line, what I would say is, it makes it lumpy, right. As we manage through the volume and we have a lot of scenarios running for volume between our legacy plant in China and our ramp up of our new US manufacturing here and so as we work through that we have lots to deal with. We have the period costs, period expenses as we initially start to ramp up and then inventory made in US manufacturing is at a higher cost because it's absorbing a lot more overhead across a very small in the beginning, small amount of volume and so we put more product in inventory at a higher cost. So it's going to take us a while to work through that. It's going to be lumpy but having said that we're right in line with our expectations and the team has been working on this for several years. It's a big part of our strategy , we get the redundancy from it. We also get long term efficiency out of it. And so it's just something that we're going to have to work through here in the medium term and working through the financials but at the end of the day it's the right strategic move. And then regarding US demand, we won't be at full scale for US demand in the next 6 to 12 months, it will take longer than that. We'll have to get into our second line, and that will come in 2020. And then last third part of the question, if I caught it all was regarding tariffs and the team still is doing a great job mitigating the tariff impact to date, it's immaterial and that's why we're not calling it out to this point and I think like everybody we're waiting to get the details on the latest round of tariffs and what exactly those mean but I think the team has done a real nice job here of mitigating to date. And then although obviously not part of the strategy for US manufacturing , it was driven by a redundancy and increased capacity for the team but as it turns out once we do get to scale here in our US manufacturing facility, we will be able to serve the US from the US and the tariffs won't be an issue at all. So, very happy with how our long-term manufacturing strategy is coming together. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley, your line is open. David Lewis : Good afternoon and congrats, clearly an inflection quarter and Shacey and I wanted to start with, obviously the US inflection is where people are going to be focused on it. So I wonder, just give us more details Shacey, it's hard for you to move your business this quickly historically but yet you did it. So when you think about the drivers, this particular quarter in the US, is it greater access because of the pharmacies that just lowering access to getting on the system? Is it enthusiasm around DASH, payer access, It would be helpful, I just have a quick question for Wayde. Shacey Petrovic : Thanks David. And really, it is all of the above. I highlight the pharmacy is really helping to improve the customer experience, our strategic rationale for the pharmacy was that combined with pay as you go, it would be a better customer experience and over time, it would be a more attractive channel for us and then you could lower barriers to adoption. And so I think what you're seeing is clearly DASH is an appealing product for patients and for physicians but this idea that physicians can now prescribe a product for a patient without having to worry so much about walking a patient in for four years, I really think that that's helping to change the way that both patients and physicians are thinking about Omnipod and visibility to prescribe it earlier and maybe for a subset of patients that you might not otherwise have done and just a little bit more color we're starting to see that in terms of the complexion of our user base, starting to see more type 2 users certainly more Medicare aid users so that increased access there is also helping to expand the patient population. So it really is combine the strength in the product platform, really the strength of the business model, the pay-as-you-go business model and then the increased access both in pharmacy and in Medicare and Medicaid helping to drive that record new patient starts installed base growth. David Lewis : Okay, very helpful Shacey and Wayde just --can you just give us the underlying ex-US growth this quarter adjusted for inventory indirect gross up and any comparisons which you mindful of as we head into the third quarter which is really the first apples to apples quarter and how we should be thinking about second half ex-US growth on an apples-to-apples basis. Thanks so much. Nice quarter. Wayde McMillan : You bet. Hi David. So the biggest impact for the Q2 growth rate and the sequential decline to our guidance is process around converting to our distributor in Europe last year in Q2 and basically boil it down into two big pieces, one on a positive note, we had 50% price increase from going direct and then also the challenge or disruption is moving through the direct process where we had to buyback inventory as well as work through some tougher comps that were out there in Q2 last year which become an easy comp for Q2 this year. So if you put all that together normalizing it, it's about a 90% to 100% impact, David, so you can think about working from Q2 to Q3, down about 90% to 100% just for the international transition and other than that really when you look at our guidance range at the high end, we're really anchoring that to the performance that we've had over the first half. And so pretty strong growth. And that's really across both US and O-US regions. And then I think I would just add for Q3, we are actually a little higher than we've talked about on a normalized basis. So, we've said several times and again in the guidance this quarter that we think the normalized growth rate internationally is high teens, low-20s and looking at the guidance here for international were above that and there's a couple of reasons there is a small hangover from the disruption in Europe last year that gives us a slight increase. And then we've got good visibility into our pipeline in Q3 it look strong. And so we took the momentum. The strength of our pipeline and small impact of a slightly or easy comp compared to Q3 last year and that's what gets us to the 22% to 26% here in Q3. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Robbie Marcus : Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a really nice quarter. Wayde, maybe you could help us understand kind of similar then a question that David just asked on international but for the US that if you strip out all the price increases that we're seeing, you said there was a good portion of patients that we're getting the higher price DASH in the quarter. What do you think the underlying patient volume was in second quarter? And how do we think about that for the 2020?, Wayde McMillan : Rob, you still there? We might have lost just the end of your question. Rob, you still there? Operator : I do apologize. It looks like we did just lose the line of Robbie Marcus. Wayde McMillan : Okay, Operator : We will go on to the next question, our next question... Wayde McMillan : Why don't we do that, then -- when Robbie comes back in queue, please let us know and then we'll get to his question. Operator : Perfect. Yes, sir, until then, we'll take the next question from Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Joanne Wuensch : Good afternoon, everybody. Two questions, the first one is the steps to the Horizon launch and we are talking about starting clinical trials shortly and then it sounds like it's still on track for the end of next year, how do we get from clinical trials to full launch? Shacey Petrovic : Thanks Joanne. Yes, we are excited and I think as we've said with Horizon we're focused in three areas. So, the first is, we're really focused -- from a development perspective on just ease of use and ensuring that we have a system that multiple daily injection users can transition to, we're focused on phone control which all the market research indicates is going to be a game changer for our users. And then the third is, we are focused on launching with the pediatric indication which is why we were so excited about the data that was presented at EDA. So the work that flat between now and pivotal is to complete the commercial development of the product and then to enter into pivotal and achieve those outcomes that we're looking for and we believe that we're going to benefit from the breakthrough devices designation of the FDA of an accelerated review and we are hopeful that because we'll have entered pivotal with the commercial system that we'll be able to either leverage that as a limited market release or to a somewhat protracted limited market release and then move into full market release with the system. So our goal is to be on the market in the second half of next year. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you. And then, and then a question, I think this is such a small percentage of your revenue but I did want to ask about drug delivery with a little bit better or less worse, the way you look at, is there something just to call out there or just normal course of business? Shacey Petrovic : It's normal course of business, Our guidance for and performance for drug delivery is always based primarily on the forecast from our largest customers. So that's what that reflects both from a guidance and performance standpoint. Operator : Thank you. And Robbie Marcus has rejoined the queue. Our next question does come from him, Robbie Marcus, JP Morgan. Your line is open. Robbie Marcus : Thank you, and hopefully the second time will be a little better. Wayde, I just, I don't know how much you heard but I just wanted to ask, kind of like what David asked on underlying volumes in international growth, we know that DASH comes at a higher price but without the PDM it appears that there was a substantial portion of your underlying base that upgraded the DASH that didn't need to get a PDM. So it's just pure price increase year for year. Can you help us understand what the underlying US patient volume growth was? And how to think about the installed this growth for 2019? I know you did metric in ' 17 and '18, just help us understand that this year. Wayde McMillan : Yes, you bet Robbie glad to have you back. So the customer growth is not significantly different than what we experienced overall and a reminder for DASH, It's a new product, and so for people who are coming on DASH for the first time are new patient starts there isn't a price increase but as you mentioned we are getting some mix benefit and on the premium of existing customers that move from another channel into the pharmacy and where we don't have to give them a PDM. And so, when you net all that out, we believe that our the PDM headwind as well as a benefit from it was just a slight unfavorable for the quarter and really not a material impact on our results. So netting the PDM headwind with the benefit of the mix and people moving in on DASH in the pharmacy. So I think you can think about our growth rate as not significantly different from our overall customer growth plus the mix or premium benefit of people moving onto or new patients on DASH that we didn't previously have because they're not moving from another product So we don't have a price increase on those. Robbie Marcus : Great and then if I think about guidance and the balance of the year, it seems like price headwind from the lost PDM and the benefit of DASH are offsetting each other to a degree, I don't know if you've commented on it if there is any stocking in the pharmacy, when I look at guidance for the balance of the year it does appear to have credit decelerating trends from the second quarter. So, just help us understand if underlying volume growth is pretty reflective of the second quarter results? New patient starts don't have a huge benefit in each individual quarter, help us understand what gets you to the slower growth in the second half. Thanks a lot. Wayde McMillan : Sure. Yes, you bet. Well, there is a lot there Robbie so worked through it, let me know if I miss any of it. So regarding the PDM, we had a pro rata, We've talked about a pro rata amount over the three quarters, Q1 to Q4. As I mentioned, we had a slight unfavorable in Q2, we're assuming the same for Q3 and then we're still planning for a net neutral across 2019, so that assumes that as we accrue more patients in the pharmacy on DASH that we will start to offset the PDM fully here in 2019 and on a net basis for 2019 be neutral. So from a guidance standpoint, if you look at the high end of our US growth rate for Q3, 24% that's the same growth rate as we've had in the first half. So the way we're thinking about it is if we continue with the acceleration that we've seen in the first half will end up at the high end of our guidance. If we end up growing more like we did last year in 2019 which we're still accelerating and doing very well, we'll end up more like at the lower end of our guidance range. So it's really just thinking about how we've been accelerating through 2019 and how we're accelerating here in the first half of 2019 and at either end of the spectrum, we believe its strong growth. Having said that we have a lot of things we're working through. Shacey talks a lot about years in the making, well, we just had one quarter of managing through a new patients and a new product launch as well as our shift in our business model and the US teams are doing an incredible job here just working with them here for the past few months and seeing all that they're doing in the US, but they're also sharing capabilities and helping our European teams build capabilities and ramp up and then obviously getting pulled into US manufacturing and all that has to happen to make our US manufacturing run. So just an incredible amount of things happening here at the same time and very proud of the team and how we work through it and actually exceeded our expectations during Q2. So that's what gives us confidence that we can hit the high end but also just being realistic that we're working through a lot of things. And frankly, if we end up at 20% in the US at the low end of the range that will still be above what we did all of last year in 2019. Robbie Marcus : Thanks again and nice quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with SVB Leerink. Your line is open. Danielle Antalffy : Hey, good afternoon guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on a really great quarter. Just a follow-up question as we think about the -- Shacey, to follow up on your commentary around better customer experience with DASH etc., can you talk about what that could mean or maybe you already have some sense of what that has meant from an attrition perspective? Have you seen the needle start to move there and where do you think that can ultimately go over time with DASH and also I guess. going through the pharmacy? Shacey Petrovic : Danielle, I think it's a great question and it's something we've been monitoring closely. We actually predicted that as we lower barriers to get onto the product that we could see attrition tick up. On balance, all of our analysis demonstrate to us that that was the right decision because we were ultimately going to grow the customer base and even if we end up with a slightly Higher attrition rate, we'd be able to grow the customer base at a higher rate. There is no evidence this quarter that the attrition rate was higher. And so what we're seeing is early indications that our expectation that the customer base would grow in an accelerated way because of DASH and the business model, both how appealing the product was , but also just how differentiated the business model was. So I think our early indications are good that we were right about the business model attractiveness. I think we're going to be watching the attrition rate, very carefully. Just to see what happens as we lower these barriers to get onto the product, so stay tuned on that front. We'll certainly provide color as we get it. Danielle Antalffy : Okay and then just one quick follow-up. Wayde probably, this one's for you. You lots of transitioning from a manufacturing perspective, were you guys at all supply constraint here in the quarter and did that have any impact on sales? Was that a headwind maybe actually could have done better? Wayde McMillan : Hi, Danielle. No, we're in really good shape from a supply standpoint and that's part of the redundancy plan here. In fact heading into the DASH launch, we built inventory and heading into the act and manufacturing ramp up we built some inventory just to make sure we're ahead of it. So we're feeling very good about the situation we're in from a manufacturing and supply standpoint. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Taylor with UBS. Your line is open. Matt Taylor : Hi, thank you for taking the question. So I just wanted to ask one question about the horizon. I just wanted to make sure that you are still targeting late 20, I don't know if you have said that today. And when you think about combination systems. Can you talk about your plans or ability to drive to other combination systems with other sensors in the future with the ace designation? Shacey Petrovic : Sure. Thanks, Matt. Yes, I did confirm that we still plan to be in the market in the second half of next year and we're on track and to pivotal at the end of this year. And so I'm very excited about that progress. We do fully expect our system to be inter-operable and it's one of the rationales behind partnering with tight pool that we have a system that can work with other algorithms other sensors, etc. So, we see the value in interoperability and are planning for that down the road but at this point, our partner is Dexcom and we are very excited about the value of horizon with the Dexcom Partnership their sensor, which is terrific and firm control. Matt Taylor : Thank you. Could you just talk about the trends that we're seeing in the pump market. More broadly, your competitor was talking about the accelerating trends, clearly you've had very strong growth here too. Can you talk about what you think the underlying growth for the market is and how that could be sustained over the next couple of years as these new technologies come out? Shacey Petrovic : Sure. You know Matt, we always say that the pulp market is growing and it has accelerated in the last few years in part due to accelerating adoption of CGM and as CGM has grown that's been terrific for us because what happens is the patients get visibility to their glucose trends, they recognize that there are opportunities to get better control and then they look for tools to get better tighter control and Omnipod is obviously a big piece of that. So the increasing adoption of CGM has certainly helped to fuel the overall growth of the pump market and in particular Omnipod has been a big part of that too because the other thing that's CGM does is get a patient comfortable with a wearable and so that's one of the hurdles to Omnipod adoption that CGM growth has helped to address and of course the vast majority of our patients are coming from multiple daily injections, so overall we're helping to go grow the category. We believe in the United States that the market itself is growing somewhere around a 10% CAGR and outside of the United States in the markets that we compete in, which are primarily these more mature European markets, it's growing somewhere less than that somewhere between 5% and 10%. And so a nice growth overall and obviously we're getting a bigger share of that market. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Margaret Kaczor with William Blair. Your line is open. Margaret Kaczor : Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. First off , thank you guys for all the helpful metrics on the front on the call, that was helpful. Maybe just a follow-up on some of those as you guys have gains from the new coverage for DASH at 50% now. I think is what you referenced, should we assume that these are all under pharmacy and inclusive of the Type 2 patients? And then as we see kind of that mix benefit, it start picking up higher, why shouldn't we see that continue to benefit numbers if you're about 15% to 20% of patients on pharmacy today? Shacey Petrovic : Thanks, Margaret. It's a DASH has covered both under pharmacy and DME But the vast majority of the coverage today is through the pharmacy. So obviously we've spoken in the past about the reduced barriers for adoption in the pharmacy particularly for the Type 2 patient. And so that's true for the vast majority of the coverage that we have established for DASH users in the pharmacy. In terms of acceleration of adoption, I would expect that DASH adoption will accelerate commensurate with the establishment of access and we started to see that already, as I think Robbie mentioned earlier, it takes a long time for us to move the needle on the overall base but we're seeing indications already in new patient starts where we obviously ramped access throughout the quarter but we landed the quarter in a third of our new patient starts being DASH and so that's an indication of kind of an early indicator of where adoption is going. So that's exciting from our perspective, I think the early indications are very strong. Margaret Kaczor : Okay. And part of the question was kind of understanding the revenue model, because as you guys get that mix benefit, maybe going from one channel and maybe having more direct control that patient yourself and maybe moving some of the existing installed base into that channel, why shouldn't we continue to see that again going into the second half of this year and into next year. And then just kind of on a Type 2 side, any kind of update of your coverage there with any notable changes maybe either that happened this quarter or going forward. Thanks. Shacey Petrovic : Yes, I think we would expect to see that continue to grow in that tailwind as we had through the rest of this year and going forward as we transition into the pharmacy that was part of the strategic rationale but it was a more attractive channel for us for the patient for the physician, etc. And the same thing is true for type 2 which is why I shared that in my opening remarks that we expect that population to continue to grow as we establish access in the pharmacy that is a great channel for people living with Type 2 insulin dependent diabetes to access Omnipod. And so as we establish more access there we do expect that population to grow as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Your line is open. Jayson Bedford : Hi, good afternoon. Just a couple of quickies here. I wanted to ask about US growth. Is there any way you can comment or quantify the number of new prescribers meaning an expansion on the prescriber base if that is indeed a source of the faster growth you're seeing? Shacey Petrovic : Thanks, Jason. We haven't shared that in the past. I will say we track of both new prescribers or new clinics as well as penetration into our existing clinics and both are increasing significantly. So we are getting, I guess to put it in a more colloquial term we're getting more same-store sales and more new store sales both across the board. Jayson Bedford : Okay. And then, when do you expect to file for ace designation? Shacey Petrovic : We haven't shared that. We have said that we fully expect to take advantage of that pathway, but for us, it's really not necessary until we have additional sensors. You know that our ICGMs. So we're not in a hurry but it is part of our strategy for both at Tidepooll and likely Horizon. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Ryan Blicker with Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Ryan Blicker : Hi, good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just starting with installed base growth, do you still expect the US installed base growth in 2019 to be consistent with revenue growth? And similar question for international, I guess given the higher second half guidance, do you now expect the international installed base to grow at least in the low '20s per year or is it still in that range that you mentioned previously? Wayde McMillan : Sure. Yes. So this is Wayde, I can serve Ryan. We are assuming that the installed base is growing similar to the overall sales growth rate and it's a bit of a tough number to gauge right now because it bounces around a little bit but at this point, we don't see a significant deviation and just one clarification there is I think a lot of people think about the change in pricing in DASH but for people who are new to DASH that we're not on a product before, it's not a price increase because they're are new to DASH and they're not moving from anything. So although we are getting premium for the pod with DASH because it's been primarily in the pay-as-you-go model that is an uplift to our overall average selling price but it's not a price increase for us. From an international standpoint, we think it's going to -- the customer base should also grow in that high-teens-low '20s growth rate. And so that's our expectation is the primary driver for growth in the region. Ryan Blicker : Great. Okay. And then, just sticking with international, you talked about starting some new market expansion in 2020, it doesn't sound like it will be any major new markets but how should we think about that maybe that incremental growth off of that high teens to low '20s basically you've talked about, could it be significant or should we think of that is only a slight incremental benefit to 2020. Thank you. Shacey Petrovic : Thanks, Ryan. Yes, I think for us, the business model is all about the long term. So any one market in any given year isn't going to be a major contributor at all, it's really all about retaining and building that business and that customer base over the long term. So we really want to be thoughtful about that. I wouldn't expect it to be a significant contributor at all in 2020. It's really about the long-term story and how that can contribute over a number of years. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ravi Misra with Berenberg Capital, your line is open. Ravi Misra : Hi, great, thank you. Can you hear me okay? Shacey Petrovic : Yes. Ravi Misra : Great, thanks for taking the questions. Shacey, just one question on Type 2 and then I had a follow-up or Wayde. So on the Type 2 commentary that you mentioned, can you just help us think about do these patients have the same reorder patterns as Type 1 and kind of how does this early success, it seems fit into your strategy with some of the more concentrated Insulin Delivery Systems that you're working on? Shacey Petrovic : Yes, I think it's a great question. So there is no indication really that utilization or reorder patterns differ with the type 2 insulin dependent patient versus type 1. but again it's really early days. So we're just starting to see indications of strength in this patient population in our new patient starts. As we gather a larger base over time, we'll learn more about utilization and retention and reorder patterns in that base. As it relates to our concentrated insulins, making great progress there. I think we had mentioned either ADA or in the last call that we have submitted U-500 to the FDA. And that has never, we never really intended that to have a major contribution to revenue, it's more of a niche product. U-200 probably has more potential but we have also been saying for about a year now that market research and now this early experience with DASH is showing us that concentrated insulins will be helpful but definitely not required to see significant growth in the type 2 insulin dependent patient population, and in fact with Omnipod's ability to reduce the total daily dose of insulin and with how appealing the product is from a simplicity and discretion standpoint, we probably have access to the majority of people living with insulin dependent type 2s and we're certainly making an effort to demonstrate the value of this technology in that patient population today and not wait for concentrate insulin's at both come to market. Ravi Misra : Great, thanks. And then Wayde, it's just one for you, just maybe a little bit accounting vanquish, but just curious as you kind of flow through the PDM or give that away or phase that out. Just curious, how should we think about the warranty expense associated with that and is that built into your kind of three year targets around that 70% gross margin approaching or is that incremental upside? Thanks. Wayde McMillan : It is built in and we would assume depending on the experience level. So as our experience levels change then we change our warranty accrual but we wouldn't see it as upside or benefit because we accrue the warranty at our cost of goods sold and that's still what we're issuing the product that .So we don't see a change to the warranty materially as a result of the new product, unless our experience factor changes on the new product and it's early days on that. So we don't have an updated estimate. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Suraj Kalia with Northland. Your line is open. Suraj Kalia : Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a nice quarter. Shacey, let me start out with ADA and one of the things that, at least on the fundamental level, we all kind of trying to understand the competitive advantage rendered with any of the closed-loop systems TIR for I think control IQ was 71 you guys have preliminary data at 73, Medtronic seems to be in that ballpark. I guess where I'm headed Shacey, I love to get your thoughts, would you think and this was also raised at last year's ATTP about a clustering and the relative lack of advantages, I'd love to get your thoughts, what do you think is the key thing that needs improvement? Is it the pump? Because you did mentioned the architecture of Omnipod, is it the algorithm? Or is it the CGM? There seems to be a disconnect somewhere in terms of one system breaking free from the remaining? Shacey Petrovic : Thanks for the question, Suraj. I would say that 73% time in range especially in children, which is a very, very challenging population ages 2 to 6 that's a remarkable improvement from average time and range today. The average person living with Type 1 diabetes I think is sitting in the '40s, maybe 50% time and range. So this is a marked increase that automated insulin delivery and the addition of great sensors and algorithms and great pumps are bringing to the community and it will make a difference in terms of outcomes and quality of life. When I think about a breakthrough system actually it would come down to ease of use because all of these systems in well-controlled clinical trials are going to deliver great outcomes but what's going to actually deliver great quality of life and great outcomes in the real world is just how easy these systems are to use and that's one of the reasons why we focus so much on the MDI user on ease of use and on phone control, which we think can help drive more adherents more convenience and more ease of use. So that's really where we focused and where we think we can get differentiation and kind of breakthrough to use your words. Suraj Kalia : Got it. And finally, Shacey, in terms of and I know a number of comments were made a third of the patients and please correct me if I misheard it, a third of the new patient starts had DASH, the other thing I heard was a number of DASH patients work T2s. Can you parse out what a percent of your new patient adds were T1's versus T 2's. I guess just trying to put our arms around the current penetration of T1s in the US. Tandem obviously give some numbers Medtronic, we know, I know you guys, we have summer of idea but I'd love for you guys to parse out T 1's and T 2's and see the level of penetration especially within T1S. Thank you for taking my questions and congrats on a great quarter. Shacey Petrovic : Thanks, Suraj. Yes, we don't break that out, but I will say that this was a -- as I mentioned just an all-time record high for us in terms of new patient starts. And so we did have great adoption across both Type 1 and insulin dependent Type 2s which is notable in the DASH population that T2 had picked up significantly in new users and that was an interesting leading indicator we're going to tell everybody. If it turns into a trend. Operator : Thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ms. Shacey Petrovic for any further remarks. Shacey Petrovic : Thank you and thanks everyone for joining us on today's call. We are building just great positive momentum from a strong start to the year and delivered better than expected results in the first half of 2019 and now expect a stronger second half finish. None of this progress would be possible without the tremendous Insulet team around the world who works day in and day out to improve the lives of people living with diabetes. Thank you all for your hard work and dedication to our Company and to all of us impacted by diabetes. With that, I look forward to updating all of you on our continued progress in the months ahead. Thanks and have a great evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ms. Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Thank you. Please go ahead. Deborah Gordon : Thank you, Lauren. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for Insulet\u2019s third quarter 2019 earnings call. Joining me today are Shacey Petrovic, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Wayde McMillan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The replay of this call will be archived on our Web site and our press release discussing our third quarter 2019 results and fourth quarter and full year 2019 guidance is also available in the IR section of our Web site. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to be materially different from any future results implied by such statements. Such risks and uncertainties in addition to the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements include those referenced in our Safe Harbor statement in our third quarter earnings release and in the company's filings with the SEC. Please note that we assume no obligation to update these forward looking statements even if actual results or future expectations change materially. Also, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis. With that, I'll turn the call over to Shacey. Shacey Petrovic : Thanks, Deb, and good afternoon, everyone. It is an exciting time at Insulet as we continue to build on our incredible growth and progress. We delivered another quarter of strong financial and operational performance and we are well positioned to close the year with great momentum. Our strong performance has been years in the making and is the result of a very large and growing market, and the work we have done to build a powerful foundation for the company. Both the Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes segments represent significant unmet needs, which Insulet is uniquely positioned to address. The opportunity is huge. Approximately 1.7 million people in the United States live with Type 1 diabetes and about the same number in our international markets we serve today. Additionally, we estimate that the Type 2 insulin requiring population in the United States is between 2.5 million and 3 million people and growing with a similar size population in our international regions. The opportunity is also urgent, because many people living with diabetes are not achieving optimal glycemic targets, which can lead to near and long-term health complications. To unlock our market opportunities, we have spent the last couple of years transforming the business and executing on four strategic imperatives. One, expand market access; two, drive consumer-focused innovation with our Pod therapy; three, strengthen our global footprint; and four, ensure operational excellence throughout our organization. 2019 has been a year in which these strategic imperatives are now coming to fruition and our strong results are reinforcing our confidence in Insulet\u2019s long-term prospects. We are beginning to realize the returns on our investments and hard work over the last several years, and we are just getting started. The successful execution of our strategy demonstrates that we have the right team and approach to capture the significant opportunities before us. Improving the lives of people with diabetes remains central to everything we do and we are focused on delivering our life-changing innovations to the diabetes community around the world. During today\u2019s call, I will discuss key financial highlights and provide an overview of the progress we made on our strategic imperatives. I\u2019ll then turn the call over to Wayde who will discuss our third quarter financial results in greater detail and share an update to our 2019 outlook. We will then open the call for questions. Starting with our financial performance. We have consistently outperformed throughout 2019 and our third quarter was no exception. We generated $192 million in revenue, exceeding our guidance by $11 million at the high end and representing a 27% increase year-over-year. This was driven by 34% revenue growth in our global diabetes product line with both our U.S. and international operations firing on all cylinders. I\u2019m proud of the team\u2019s progress and execution across our strategic imperatives and the team\u2019s sustained focus on our mission. With these strong results, we achieved our fifth consecutive quarter of greater than 20% revenue growth and our fifth consecutive quarter of both positive operating and net income. In fact, 2019 will mark our fourth consecutive year of greater than 20% annual revenue growth. Given our sustained outperformance, we are once again raising guidance for 2019, which Wayde will talk to shortly. Turning to our efforts to advance our strategic imperatives. I will begin with market access, which we have focused on to both increase coverage and enable innovation through the pharmacy channel. In the third quarter, we continued to successfully expand coverage for commercial, Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. Additionally, Medicare beneficiaries continue to represent a growing percentage of our Omnipod users, not only because of the increased coverage but also because our product design and functionality are incredibly well suited for the Type 2 insulin-requiring population, many of whom are Medicare beneficiaries. We are also increasing our impact through innovation, both in terms of our new product innovations and also our new business model innovation with our unique pay-as-you-go model. Our recently launched Omnipod DASH is available with zero upfront cost, an exciting disrupter with several unique advantages for both patients and payers, because we know cost and access are hurdles to more people adopting Pod therapy. Through our pay-as-you-go model and the pharmacy channel, we are providing customers access to this easy-to-use technology with no upfront cost or lock-in period. This means Omnipod DASH can be used by far more patients, many of whom would otherwise not be able to access or afford new technology. And every quarter, since DASH\u2019s launch, a record number of new users have adopted Omnipod in the United States. Based on overwhelmingly positive feedback on DASH, we have seen and continue to believe that patients who try Omnipod and DASH will stay on product and experience its long-term benefits. Our new model and pharmacy access are true differentiators because they benefit patients and also provide reduced risk and cost of member attrition for payers. Because of its simplicity, low cost and low commitment, physicians can feel confident recommending Omnipod to a greater number of patients and earlier in the treatment pathway. The earlier an MDI user adopts Pod therapy, the higher the likelihood of better glycemic control and the lower the likelihood of near and long-term health complications. As I communicated on last quarter\u2019s call, physicians have told us they are now recommending Omnipod DASH to more multiple daily injection users, particularly Type 2 patients, a population many doctors would not have recommended for pump therapy. DASH\u2019s simplicity, discretion and ease-of-use make it a very appealing and beneficial technology for people still using multiple daily injections, including those living with Type 2 diabetes. Market access gains helped drive increased new starts and as typical of our business, the vast majority of our new starts in the third quarter came from multiple daily injection users. Growth of DASH continues to be commensurate with our work to establish access and reimbursement. DASH represented approximately 50% of our U.S. new starts in the third quarter. Additionally, over 20% of our total U.S. volume is now going through the pharmacy, up from 15% to 20% last quarter and 10% to 15% just two quarters ago. And for the second quarter in a row, we saw a significant increase in the percentage of our new starts through the pharmacy being individuals living with Type 2 diabetes. In terms of new product innovation, we are in the final stages of our Omnipod Horizon development and are extremely excited to bring our game-changing automated insulin delivery system to the market in the second half of next year. We have designed a system we are incredibly proud of and we remain on track to start recruiting for pivotals next month. This will consist of a three-month outpatient clinical study of 240 individuals across a broad age range, including pediatrics. We are excited to send people home with our Horizon automated insulin delivery system in a matter of weeks. With Horizon, Insulet will be the first to deliver tubeless, personal smartphone controlled automated insulin delivery. Horizon\u2019s unique form factor and the incredible design work that has gone into securing our algorithm on the Pod give Insulet strong competitive advantages over other AID devices. Horizon\u2019s architecture is uniquely positioned to provide more time in closed loop, because we have done the work to put the algorithm directly on our disposable Pod rather than on an accompanying device the user must carry around. Our engineering teams have worked closely with our colleagues at Dexcom to enable the Dexcom sensor to speak directly to our Pod without requiring a PDM or phone to be in closed loop. These highly complex technical programs require great collaboration and great design and engineering work to keep the user experience simple. Horizon is designed to be plug and play even for new users coming from multiple daily injections. Over time, the system optimizes automated insulin delivery based on actual daily insulin used, which means it should require less ongoing maintenance. Horizon will offer an out-of-the-box experience where anyone can easily transition to our AID system. You simply put our Pod in with your Dexcom sensor and within minutes you are in closed loop. It\u2019s as simple as it gets. We know that diabetes can be a significant burden and is always front of mind. We also know that users don\u2019t want to have to think more about their diabetes and nobody\u2019s needs are exactly the same. Horizon will offer a personalized approach to customized diabetes management. One of the system\u2019s unique features is the ability to select multiple glucose targets to allow for personalized control and a unique level of customization. Horizon is designed to provide an unparallel level of flexibility to give our users personalization and peace of mind. People living with diabetes helped us design these and other Horizon features. We have completed our formative human factor studies and are in the midst of our summative human factor testing and feedback has been terrific. So we are thrilled to be in the final stages of our development work and to bring our advanced system to the diabetes community next year. In addition to our own internal product development programs, we continue to support Tidepool\u2019s development efforts on an open source AID loop app that can be accessed through the Apple App Store. Our goal with this collaboration is to position Omnipod to be a FDA cleared component of the Tidepool Loop system and to support patient choice in the market. Turning now to our efforts to expand globally. We are making great progress on our strategic imperative of strengthening our global footprint in geographies with large addressable markets and sustainable business models. Direct operations in Europe have been firmly in place for over a year and we continue to unlock new opportunities. Across our existing and new markets, there is significant unmet need for simple, effective insulin delivery and we are enthusiastic about the huge runway in front of us. We plan to launch a limited market release of Omnipod DASH in the next month in select European markets, and we will continue to rollout DASH across Europe throughout 2020. We know our customers are exciting for our latest technology and DASH is the platform with which we prefer to enter new markets. Our team is working on language translations, new market development and vetting of potential strategic partners in order to ensure that our go-to-market strategies are well conceived. As a reminder, DASH is the first step to phone control and we plan to bring Horizon with phone control to our international markets. Looking ahead to the rest of the year, we will remain focused on solidifying our leadership position in the international markets in which we have a presence today. Beginning in 2020, we will look to expand our global footprint into new markets that offer compelling value and opportunity. There is significant interest and unmet need not only in Europe but around the world and our international team is prioritizing the most attractive opportunities and go-to-market strategies. While we would not expect global expansion to add meaningful incremental revenue in 2020, our expansion efforts over the next few years will strengthen and broaden our global foundation and contribute continued significant top line growth over the long term. Lastly, turning to operational excellence and the ramp of our new U.S. manufacturing facility. We continue to strengthen our global operations enabling Insulet to produce exceptional, high quality products efficiently, at scale and eventually at lower landed cost in the United States. Last quarter, we began production at our new highly automated manufacturing facility in the U.S. We are now in a process of installing our second U.S. manufacturing line with production of sellable product on this line expected mid next year. Our manufacturing innovation is a key driver of our 2021 target of 70% gross margin, which we remain on track to deliver. Given our expectations for continued rapid growth, we plan to install our third line in the U.S. also in 2020. This third line will further strengthen our industry-leading position in manufacturing and operational excellence, and will ensure we are poised for a successful launch of Horizon and to meet our growing Omnipod demand across the globe. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Wayde. Wayde McMillan : Thank you. As Shacey noted, we had another quarter of strong financial and operational performance. We are pleased that the continued execution of our strategy is building value for our shareholders and further our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes. We remain focused on advancing our innovation pipeline and increasing market access to drive revenue growth and operate with excellence across the organization to expand margins. In the third quarter of 2019, we delivered revenue of 192.1 million representing growth of 41 million or 27%, which was 11 million above the high end of our guidance range. Breaking this down by product line; U.S. Omnipod revenue grew 34% to 109.5 million which was 7.5 million above the high end of our guidance range and marked our fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating growth in the U.S. This increased growth rate is mainly the result of accelerating volume growth, driven by growing our customer base and adoption of new product innovation with Omnipod DASH, primarily through the pharmacy channel. It is also due to the mix benefit on the premium for DASH and the shift to the pay-as-you-go model in the pharmacy. Our success to date is a testament for the continued execution of our commercial and operational teams as they have simultaneously launched a new product, in a new business model and in a new channel while establishing our first new manufacturing line in the U.S. International Omnipod revenue grew 35% to 67.7 million exceeding the high end of our guidance range by 5 million, primarily due to increased volume from growing demand for Omnipod within our existing European markets. As a reminder, in Q3 we anniversaried our go-direct strategy in Europe and therefore both periods reflect the 50% uplift in revenue in our European business. Drug delivery revenue was 14.9 million, a reduction of 21% and at the low end of our guidance range as a result of updated production planning with our partner. Turning to gross margin. We delivered 64.1%, down 340 basis points year-over-year and down 160 basis points sequentially in line with our expectations. As we communicated on last quarter\u2019s call, we expected a sequential decline in gross margin primarily due to the full quarter ramp of our U.S. manufacturing. As a reminder, as we increased production, we incur certain period costs including training and startup costs as well as normal inefficiencies of ramping up a new manufacturing line. We are confident over the long term our highly automated U.S. manufacturing will contribute to expanded gross margins. This headwind was partially offset by a favorable Omnipod mix from the launch of DASH in the U.S., the move into the pharmacy channel with the pay-as-you-go model as well as some favorable customer mix internationally. Operating expenses in the third quarter were 55% of revenue, an increase of 12% over the prior year, again, in line with our expectations. R&D as a percentage of revenue is sequentially lower as we had engineering and operational costs charged to R&D in Q2 that were associated with our newly constructed U.S. manufacturing facility up until the date we began producing sellable product. We ended the third quarter with operating income of 17 million representing 8.9% of revenue. Net income for Q3 was just under 1 million and included a one-time non-cash charge of 6.5 million relating to the extinguishment of 65% of our 2021 convertible notes. Following our September notes offering, we publicly stated we expected a total non-cash charge in the range of 10 million to 15 million with approximately two-thirds to be incurred in Q3 and one-third to be incurred in Q4. Since that time, we have completed our valuation work and now expect a total one-time non-cash charge of 10 million with 3 million left to be recorded in Q4. Let me take a minute to briefly summarize the successful convertible notes offering we completed in September. Given favorable market conditions and Insulet\u2019s strengthening financial performance, we felt it was an optimal time to refinance our 2021 convertible notes and conduct a new offering. This resulted in our raising 800 million and securing a low coupon rate and favorable conversion rate, among other favorable terms. Raising these funds allowed us to repurchase our 2021 convertible notes. In doing so, we were able to limit future dilution to our shareholders while also obtaining excellent financial terms. Completing this financing was an important step in executing our long-term capital plan. Again this quarter, we generated positive operating cash flows. We ended the third quarter with 637 million in cash and investments compared to 372 million at the end of the second quarter and 430 million at the end of last year. This increase was largely due to the approximate 240 million of net proceeds raised as part of the new debt issuance, which was subsequently used to repurchase the remaining 35% of the 2021 notes in October. We expect to continue to use cash for planning capital expenditures as we invest in our U.S. manufacturing and supply chain operations. To summarize the third quarter, we are pleased with the accelerated rate of revenue growth and the profitability we achieved. We expect this year\u2019s positive momentum year-to-date to continue through the end of 2019, and we remain well positioned for further revenue growth over the long term. Turning now to 2019 guidance. Given our continued financial outperformance in the first three quarters in anticipation that the positive momentum will continue, we are raising our guidance expectations for the full year by 50 million at the high end of guidance and 22 million at the low end. We now expect 2019 total revenue in the range of 722 million to 730 million representing growth of 28% to 29%. By product line, we are raising our U.S. revenue range to 410 million to 414 million representing growth of 27% to 28%. This reflects our continued confidence in our strong volume momentum given the ongoing market access and commercial expansion strategies, as well as continued ramp of our new DASH product innovation and move into the pharmacy channel with our pay-as-you-go model where we do not charge for PDMs like we did in prior years. Also including in our guidance is an updated annual PDM headwind of 4 million to 6 million, which is a reduction from our prior guide of 6 million to 8 million due to the continued strength of selling PDMs in our DME and direct channels. We also continue to benefit from a stronger tailwind from the DASH Pod premium compared to our original estimate of net neutral. For international Omnipod, we are raising our revenue to a range of 251 million to 253 million representing growth of 46% to 47%. Lastly, for drug delivery, we are updating revenue to a range of 61 million to 63 million representing a decline of 8% to 11%. For the rest of the P&L, we are reaffirming that we expect our full year 2019 gross margin to be relatively consistent with prior year. This reflects the benefit of going direct in Europe, continued operating and supply chain improvements and the mix benefit of DASH and the pharmacy with the pay-as-you-go model, as well as some favorable customer mix in Europe. This is primarily offset by headwinds as we begin to ramp our first new U.S. manufacturing line. These headwinds will continue in 2020 as we add and ramp two additional highly automated manufacturing lines in our move toward operational efficiency. We continue to expect full year 2019 operating expenses to increase approximately 25% primarily due to investing in innovation. We are committed to investing to unlock our market potential. For operating income, given our year-to-date performance, we are now planning to be at the high end of our mid-single digit percentage range. We continue to expect that our capital expenditures will be relatively consistent with 2018 as we invest in U.S. manufacturing to drive redundancy, improved efficiency and drive margin expansion over the longer term. Given the recent refinancings of some of our convertible notes, we now expect our non-cash interest expense for 2019 to be approximately 25 million and on an annualized go-forward basis to be in the range of 30 million to 35 million. Before I turn the call back to Shacey, I want to share my enthusiasm about our performance. It is extremely rewarding to see all the hard work that goes into executing our strategy result in positive outcomes for our customers and value for our shareholders. We remain focused on advancing our strategies and we expect our strong performance to continue over the long term. We remain on track to deliver on our 2021 targets of 1 billion in revenue, gross margin of 70% and operating margin in the mid-teens. With that, I\u2019ll hand the call back over to Shacey. Shacey Petrovic : Thanks, Wayde. On behalf of our entire team at Insulet, I want to reiterate how pleased we are with the strong momentum of our company. 2019 has been a year of execution and it is clearer than ever that we have the right team and strategy in place to deliver on our commitments to customers, the broader diabetes community and to our shareholders. And now, I\u2019ll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. Operator. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Ryan Blicker with Cowen. Your line is open. Ryan Blicker : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just starting with the pharmacy channel transition. You mentioned the pharmacy channel was an overall net positive to U.S. revenue in Q3 and that you now expect a greater tailwind from the Pod pricing premium. I believe previous guidance assumed about a $6 million to $8 million tailwind from the Pod pricing premium to offset the $6 million to $8 million PDM headwind. What do you expect now for pricing tailwinds year-over-year? Wayde McMillan : Sure. So regarding the transition here, there\u2019s really two major components. So as we think about it, the headwind from the no charge PDMs is actually less than we expected even though we are seeing the headwind as we transition to our pay-as-you-go model, we\u2019re selling more PDMs in our legacy DME and direct businesses as those businesses continue to perform pretty well and continue to grow. The other side of it is the premium that we\u2019re getting on our new DASH product as well as in the pay-as-you-go model in the pharmacy. And so our original estimates given that it was such a new channel, we were conservative and I think now we\u2019re falling more in the middle of our range where we had run scenarios. But what I have to say is it\u2019s still very early days. And so we are seeing some benefit today, but we\u2019re just a couple of quarters into strategy that has significant change to our business. And so now we\u2019re finding ourselves kind of in the middle of our scenarios. We\u2019re very happy for where we\u2019re performing right now. But having said that, I think we still have long ways to go to see how this plays out. Shacey Petrovic : Yes, I think that\u2019s right. It\u2019s early days. If you think about it, we\u2019re three quarters into a strategy that took three years to develop and design and we\u2019ll be deploying for many years. So it\u2019s just a changing situation. The channel is growing rapidly and so price is changing as we bring on new payers, et cetera. Ryan Blicker : Got it. And then maybe just digging into the U.S. number a bit more, really impressive results. Can you provide any more color on new patient trends? I guess assuming that utilization didn\u2019t increase meaningfully versus Q2, it seems like U.S. new patient starts could have approached or exceeded 10,000 in the quarter. Is that in the ballpark or did utilization increase sequentially? I just want to make sure we don\u2019t get ahead of ourselves moving forward. Thank you. Shacey Petrovic : It was another record quarter in terms of new patient starts. So we\u2019re not really giving that color. I think if you think about what drove revenue, the reason we moved to volume and gave you that kind of highlight around volume and mix is that it\u2019s just the primary driver behind revenue. As we move into the pharmacy, so now we\u2019ve got 20% of our U.S. base and 50% of our new patient starts, we start to lose a little bit of visibility to the customer base, not to new patient starts as much but to the whole customer base. You can imagine we\u2019re just sort of becoming more like a pharmaceutical company where we\u2019ve got visibility to prescriptions as opposed to customers and even that is a little bit delayed. So I hate to sort of \u2013 I\u2019m not avoiding the question, but really we just have limited visibility. We think that\u2019s the right tradeoff because the pharmacy channel is such a better customer experience and it\u2019s a more efficient channel for us. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Robbie Marcus : Great. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a really nice quarter. Shacey Petrovic : Thanks, Robbie. Robbie Marcus : I wanted to really try and dive in around the change that\u2019s happening in the pharmacy, because it\u2019s clear that this is materially increasing the patients that are signing up for DASH. So I was hoping you could give us if there\u2019s any survey work you\u2019ve done on these early patients here or any kind of qualitative feedback you can provide on what you think it is that\u2019s driving such strong new patient growth here for DASH in the pharmacy? Shacey Petrovic : Yes. I think it\u2019s a great question. What\u2019s exciting to me is some of the feedback that we\u2019re getting from physicians in terms of prescribing Omnipod earlier in the treatment pathway and for physicians that they might not have otherwise. And the reason why that\u2019s happening is number one, all the things that we know about the pay-as-you-go model, the fact that we\u2019ve reduced the commitment upfront and the lock-in period, those are really disruptive and really transformative for how clinicians can think about Pod therapy for their customers. And I think the other thing that we\u2019re trying to give color around is just the increasing use among people living with Type 2 insulin-dependent diabetes. So we know we\u2019re in a strong coverage position in the pharmacy for that population. And then as we work to establish more and more Medicare coverage, that\u2019s also really important to unlocking the Type 2 insulin-requiring patients, because we know that 60% of people living with Type 2 are over \u2013 sorry, 40% are over the age of 60. So there\u2019s a large contingent of people living with Type 2 diabetes that are covered by Medicare. So the work that we\u2019re doing to establish Medicare access in the pharmacy is really helping to unlock that huge opportunity and huge unmet need. Robbie Marcus : Yes. And just one more question here on DASH. I think it\u2019s really clear the value benefit to patients having a lower co-pay out of pocket and diabetes with very expensive disease, right now you\u2019re getting most of the new patients from MDI, but as you cycle through the year in deductibles, reset and as you go through the year where the warranties expire, do you think there is an opportunity here to pick up a meaningful amount of competitive switches from Tandem and Medtronic? Thanks. Shacey Petrovic : Sure. I think we remain really focused on our target segment which we view as the multiple daily injection user. If you think about why that is, it\u2019s really because it\u2019s the vast majority of the opportunity even among Type 1 still 60% to 65% of the \u2013 most of the opportunity is multiple daily injections and it\u2019s 95% or more of the Type 2 population, the 2.5 million to 3 million people living in the United States. So it really is the larger opportunity and where we\u2019re focused. Nothing has changed in terms of our trends. We continue to see 75% to 80% of our new users come from that segment. And of course that means we still get 20% to 25% of our new users from pump transitions, it\u2019s just less of a focus for us. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. David Lewis : Good afternoon. Just two questions from me. I\u2019ll start with Wayde. Wayde, could you just walk through the international guidance for the fourth quarter? It\u2019s lower on a dollar basis, but I\u2019m just trying to \u2013 if you can just help bridge us here to the fourth quarter number just given the underlying momentum in the third quarter? We\u2019re just into the fourth? And I had a quick follow up for Shacey. Wayde McMillan : You bet. Hi, David. So two ways to think about it. We had a very strong Q3. And so we recognized that our guide is a deceleration from Q3, but Q3 was very strong for us. We do have a bit more of a lumpier business given that a majority of our business goes through distributors. And so we did see insight to a stronger Q3 given the distributor order patterns there. So we had a bit of that going on from a deceleration standpoint. But then what I would bring us back to is we believe that the international markets we\u2019re in, given the strong team that we have there and our position in the marketplace that we\u2019re in this high teens, low-20s range. And so that\u2019s right where our guide sits, including the impact of FX. So we do have about a 4% unfavorable impact of FX included in our guidance. So we\u2019re guiding to 16 to 20. If you factor in the 4% unfavorable FX, it puts us at 20% to 24%. So we\u2019re really right where we want to be from an international standpoint, including FX granting that we had a very strong Q3 and it looks like \u2013 some of it is deceleration, but again right where we want to be for Q4. David Lewis : Okay, so a little bit of pull forward, but the underlying demand you think is there? Wayde McMillan : We do. David Lewis : Okay. And then, Shacey, I know it\u2019s a little early but you think about next year sort of reiterating the timelines around Horizon. As we think about next year and just given the innovation around that product, is there any reason to believe that rolling out Horizon will be at all disruptive to sort of a core channel and core product as you think about sort of the introduction of that launch in the back half of next year? Thanks so much. Shacey Petrovic : Sure, David, it\u2019s a good question, something we\u2019re working on today in terms of our launch plans and preparation. And so of course anything of that magnitude could offer some distraction. But I\u2019ll tell you that the team is doing all of the right things, even thinking about market access and how do we leverage all of the market access that we built in the pharmacy channel for Horizon so that we can have rapid and broad access across the channel. So I think we\u2019re doing the right things to try to minimize distraction and be able to bring that product to market as quickly and successfully as we can, because we know people are waiting for it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Your line is open. Jayson Bedford : Good afternoon and congrats on the progress. Just a couple quick ones here. Shacey, I think you mentioned that you believe you\u2019re in a strong coverage position for Type 2. Just curious, was that in reference to Medicare or were you referring to commercial in general? Shacey Petrovic : Really to both. So it\u2019s referring to the pharmacy as a really good channel for the Type 2 insulin-dependent patient. Jayson Bedford : Okay. And then there\u2019s obviously a few moving parts on price, channel, et cetera. I just want to make sure that you\u2019re still expecting growth in the U.S. installed base to be similar to U.S. sales growth. Is that fair? Shacey Petrovic : We pointed out the benefit of mix and now we talk a little bit to the premium on the Pod, so I would draw you to that. And it\u2019s the other reason why we\u2019re really giving you the color around volume. Because if you think about it, we\u2019re just becoming a bit more like a pharmaceutical company in terms of the visibility and now we\u2019ve got 20% of our total base going through the pharmacy more than that actually and 50% of our new patient customers. And so we\u2019re pointing you to volume. And then also with the benefit of mix in the pharmacy as one of the primary drivers behind revenue. We lose a little visibility as we move into the pharmacy, especially as you get out from the wholesalers to retail pharmacies and specialty pharmacies. That\u2019s the right tradeoff for sure because we know it\u2019s a much better customer experience and a better channel for Insulet, but it is the reality of where we are today. Jayson Bedford : Shacey, with DASH, have you seen any change in attrition? Shacey Petrovic : We have not. As you might remember, we have been watching that pretty carefully and of course as I mentioned, we do lose some visibility in the pharmacy. But what we can estimate, we haven\u2019t seen a change in attrition. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with SVB Leerink. Your line is open. Danielle Antalffy : Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on a really strong quarter again. A question for you, Wayde, wondering if I can push you a little bit on the Q4 guidance. It looks like you\u2019re assuming some deceleration and I\u2019m just wondering is there anything unique driving that? Is there seasonality we should be thinking of? And also one of the other pump companies like night talked about a pause ahead of their new product launch. So I assume the pay-as-you-go model we wouldn\u2019t be seeing any impact from new product cycles and pauses and such. But just wondering if you can parse out a little bit what\u2019s driving the decel, and specifically I\u2019m looking at U.S. Omnipod growth? Wayde McMillan : Yes, you bet. And we just talked about international a couple of minutes ago and just to clear that one more time, we do not see any issues in international growth rates. In fact, FX were above the high-teens, low 20s with a guidance of 6 to 20 with the 4% of unfavorable FX in there. So international very strong. And on the U.S., I think it\u2019s great we\u2019re talking about 27% to 28% guidance as a deceleration. We\u2019ve had a great year-to-date and so how we\u2019re thinking about it is great year-to-date, 27% growth, a particularly great Q3 where as Shacey said, we had record new patient starts. And we\u2019re guiding to a very strong Q4 of 25% to 29% with our year-to-date 27% right in that range. In other words, if we perform the way we have year-to-date, we\u2019ll be right in the middle of the range. Even the low end of the range requires very strong new starts and it would be our highest revenue quarter ever. So there\u2019s a couple of things going around seasonality, a couple of notes. One would be as we\u2019re increasing volume and as we said in our prepared remarks, volume through the pharmacy now is at 20%. As that grows, we would expect a headwind from seasonality in Q4 because of the switch from deductibles to co-pay. But again, it\u2019s going to be small and slight and something we\u2019re going to be watching carefully here this Q4. But certainly as we move more and more of our volume into the pharmacy, that will be getting more of a headwind to seasonality year-over-year in Q4, but probably going to be pretty small right now just given the percentage of volume through the pharmacy. The other thing we talked about was monitoring our channel inventory. We have not seen channel inventory being an issue for us yet. There\u2019s basically a no net impact again here in Q3. We did see some inventory start to build in the pharmacy channel. It\u2019s really two stages there; one, into the wholesalers and distributors and the second into stocking in the retail pharmacies. And that work did increase here in the quarter but it was offset by a reduction in our DME inventories. So there was a no net impact on a material basis for our sales this quarter. But looking ahead, we do think it will become an impact as we start to mature and grow and add more wholesalers and distributors to our pharmacy distribution channel. So those two things are something to keep an eye on from a seasonality or a phasing standpoint. But we don\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re looking at a very strong Q4 here both international and in the U.S. And I get that it looks like a deceleration from Q3, but Q3 was an amazing quarter. there\u2019s a little bit of tougher comp in Q4. We had a very strong Q4 last year, but we see a very strong performance here again in Q4. Danielle Antalffy : Okay, totally fair point and sorry to be greedy there. And just a last question. Shacey, you talked last quarter about how you really saw strength in the U.S. across all pieces of the business, including the DME channel, you saw a pretty strong Type 2 quarter. Was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on whether \u2013 it looks like that continued into this quarter, but just curious about what you can say as to the drivers in Q3 of the U.S. growth? Thanks so much. Shacey Petrovic : Sure, Danielle. And I think Wayde really covered this well. We saw strength across every channel in the U.S. and that includes pharmacy, DME and direct. But we are a bit sort of cautious about that because long term we do expect that the DME and to a lesser degree the direct business will soften as we move more of this business into the pharmacy. So Q3, amazing quarter for us. Everything was strong maybe to a greater degree than we expected it to be in the DME channel. As we look forward, we expect that to soften a bit. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mathew Blackman with Stifel. Your line is open. Mathew Blackman : Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe to start, Shacey, I\u2019m just curious as you\u2019re having ongoing dialog with payers to expand coverage, is there anything interesting coming out of those conversations worth sharing? How eager or open are payers? Are there any common points of pushback in those conversations? And how are they responding to the new models that you\u2019re putting out there? And then I have one follow-up. Shacey Petrovic : Sure. The response has been terrific and I think that\u2019s evidenced in the broad access that we\u2019ve established in such a short period of time. If you think about it, we've really just been at it for a few quarters. And we've got more than 50% coverage established now in the U.S. for DASH, primarily in the pharmacy channel. So that is a testament to how well-received this risk sharing model is and how novel it is for the market. And I think we see the benefit in how rapidly payers are establishing access, and then also obviously in the record setting new patient start quarters that we\u2019ve had over the last three quarters. One interesting dynamic that I\u2019ll point out, it might not be exactly what you\u2019re looking for Mathew, but is around Medicare and other contracting. So if you think about it, we now have more than 50% of covered lives established and we talked about this premium on the Pod that was a little bit higher than expected this quarter. And a lot of that could be driven also by pricing for payers, particularly on the Medicare side, where we haven\u2019t established contracts yet, but we\u2019re having a lot of success with the appeals process or with the exception process. So as we establish coverage with these payers, that will actually act as a little bit of a headwind. As we look to Q4 and beyond into 2020, as we establish more access, we would expect that price point to come down, especially if we\u2019re pursuing preferred positions on those payers. But by and large, the discussions have been very productive. We feel really good about having a strong foundation for DASH and one that will be leverageable for Horizon as we look to 2020 and beyond. Mathew Blackman : All right, I appreciate. That's very helpful. And then I guess the follow-up question and for you, Shacey, again, if we're at 20% pharmacy today, I don't know, look out the next five years in your mind's eye, what would you hope the ultimate channel mix would end up being for you guys? Shacey Petrovic : We want the vast majority of our business to be going through the pharmacy. I think there is some benefit \u2013 actually I should take that back. We want the vast majority of our business to be pay-as-you-go. We believe that that is the best thing for payers and the best thing for patients. And we see great attractiveness in the pharmacy channel. So I would hope that the vast majority of that would be through the pharmacy channel. But there\u2019s a benefit in having some of the business serve direct and DME as well, but we do see the best patient experience in the pharmacy channel. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson with Baird. Your line is open. Jeff Johnson : Thank you. Good evening. Shacey, maybe a demand question and then a Horizon question. On the demand side, can you break out at all kind of your mix or are you seeing any shift in mix at all between T2 and T1? Obviously, you\u2019re talking a lot about good T2 traction, but any way to help us kind of quantify or break that out? And same question on the MDI side. This one's kind of a tougher question I guess, but any way to know what percentage share capture you're enjoying of new to pump MDI patients relative to the market this quarter versus the last few qualitatively? Do you feel that's going up? Shacey Petrovic : Great questions, Jeff. I'll start with the MDI question. It\u2019s very challenging to get good data on this, but we do believe that it's increasing. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, every quarter this year, we have had a record number of new starts, the vast majority of those being multiple daily injection users adopt Omnipod. So we do believe we are seeing accelerating momentum there. And that's thanks to this investment in the pay-as-you-go model and in such a simple, easy-to-use device that is DASH. And then the other question was regarding Type 2, and I gave a little bit of color in my opening remarks here. Again, this is something we're watching very closely. We have designed messaging and education for clinicians and patients on the benefits of DASH and Omnipod for the Type 2 user, and we are starting to see traction there. So we'll call it out as we get more and more of a trend, but this is the second quarter in a row where we have had a marked increase in the number of new users through the pharmacy that have Type 2 versus Type 1. So it does seem like our early efforts around education and awareness are working in this population. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Margaret Kaczor with William Blair. Your line is open. Brandon Vazquez : Hi. This is Brandon in for Margaret. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on a great quarter. I'd like to kind of hit first on the Medicaid and as that's becoming a larger part of revenues, and Shacey you were talking about it a little bit earlier, but can you remind us if there is any meaningful differences in the commercial channel for Medicaid? And part of the reason I'm asking is, I'm sure you're all aware that on the CGM side, maybe the prerequisites are a little bit different and the reimbursement models are a little bit different. It sounds like it's a slight premium for all of you and is that how we should be thinking about it going forward? And if there is any kind of different I guess prerequisites to get onto a pump for Medicaid? Shacey Petrovic : Yes. I want to just clarify. In my opening remarks and in some of these questions that we've covered already, it's really Medicare that has become a growing population for us. And we call that out because we've always been a market leader and incredibly strong in pediatrics. And as we have started to establish access among Medicare, it's really starting to change the complexion of our \u2013 particularly, our new patient starts where we're seeing more from Medicare and older populations, as well as more in Type 2, and Medicare coverage is really helping to drive that. And when I talk about there being a bit of a premium on Medicare, right now that's because we're taking advantage of very successfully the exception and appeals process. And as we establish coverage, we would not expect to retain that premium as we get coverage with these Medicare payers. In terms of Medicaid, we continue to see that ticked up, but I wouldn't say it's \u2013 I would not say that it is one, a premium price population, and I would not say that it's a outsized portion of our new patient starts like we see with Medicare. Brandon Vazquez : Got it. That's helpful. And then looking at 2020 in the international, as you launch DASH in your international markets, will you be able to utilize kind of the same pay-as-you-go model? I can appreciate you probably won't be able to do a pharmacy channel, but going back to one of the earlier comments you made in clarifying, it seems like the pay-as-you-go has been one of the bigger catalysts for the U.S. business. So can you utilize that model? And then the follow up with that, can it be as impactful as it was to U.S. growth through 2020? Thanks. Shacey Petrovic : Sure, Brandon. Those are great questions. And we have challenged our teams across our different international geographies to determine whether or not we can bring value to people living with diabetes and to governments that are paying for these technologies through our business model, and pay-as-you-go. We've had some success with that, particularly I think of an example in Canada, for example. But we're still in the early days of understanding. You probably know that in many of these international geographies with single payer national healthcare systems that there's pretty established routes and it can be a pretty significant task to try to change pathways. But it's something that we're exploring, both for the existing markets, as well as for new market entries where we may be able to really bring value through this risk-sharing agreement to these markets. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kyle Rose with Canaccord. Your line is open. Kyle Rose : Great. Thank you very much for taking the questions and, again, congrats on a strong quarter. So just two questions from me. One, you talked about the emerging growth in the Type 2 opportunity. Maybe just give us a little more color on what you're seeing from these patients? How are they different specifically? I know you talked about attrition, but maybe from a utilization standpoint, how are they different from requirements on your sales and your customer support teams, just things of that sort? And then, I'll just give my follow up now and hop in queue. You've got ACE designation. You've got multiple algorithms both with Horizon and loop. You only have one CGM partner. We saw Tandem announce a partnership with Abbott, the other CGM player. Do you expect to work with additional CGMs in the future and just what should we expect around timing there? Thank you. Shacey Petrovic : Thanks, Kyle. So I\u2019ll start with Type 2. Really this has been I think an eye-opening experience for us because we had really thought maybe we were limited in this and our ability to serve this population. And what we're seeing is, because Omnipod reduces the total daily dose of insulin and because DASH has taken ease-of-use \u2013 DASH and pharmacies have taken ease-of-use and access to new levels that we have a stronger right to win in this population than maybe we had previously predicted. I wouldn\u2019t say we see notable differences in terms of utilization or requirements from our clinical team. Typically, these patients are being seen by an endocrinologist and so it\u2019s the same call point and the same process in terms of training and implementation for the Type 2 population that requires insulin as it is to Type 1 today. But it\u2019s early days really. This is two quarters in. So we're watching it very closely. And as we \u2013 we certainly want to provide the same level of market leading support for these patients. And so if that requires a different type of investment or approach, we will react accordingly. And then the second question was on interoperability and other sensors. We always design DASH which is our interoperable pumps that will be the basis of the submission for Horizon to be interoperable. It's why we went to the phone, because Dexcom is already on the phone with their app, and so is Libre. We don\u2019t have anything to announce right now. We are incredibly excited about our partnership with Dexcom on Horizon. But I will say we see a great experience in Europe where there's a lot of overlap between Libre and Omnipod users as well. So we're focused on Horizon and we see great opportunity for interoperability with DASH and Horizon. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ravi Misra with Berenberg. Your line is open. Ravi, your line is open. If you\u2019re phone\u2019s on mute, please un-mute. Again, Ravi, your line is open. If you\u2019re on mute, please un-mute your phone. [Operator Instructions]. Shacey Petrovic : We can move on and put him back in the queue, if he comes back on. Operator : Perfect. Thank you. Our next question comes from JP McKim with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Matt O\u2019Brien: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. This is actually Matt in for JP. Shacey, as you think about the DME and pharmacy channels going forward and the stocking that you see there, you\u2019re growing really quickly right now early days, but how do you manage the inventory levels in those channels going forward? Are they meaningful? Is it not that meaningful for you from a stocking perspective on the pharmacy side, so that\u2019s something that\u2019s easy to manage or is that something that you have to keep a close eye on going forward? Wayde McMillan : Hi, Matt. It\u2019s Wayde. I could take that one. So very different channels. First of all, the pharmacy channel is just a couple of quarters old here, very early days. So we\u2019re signing up wholesalers and distributors, it seems like every month, and expanding our logistics channel here and significant investment going into the IT side of things and EDI interfaces and moving from manual to more automated. So a lot of work going on in this area which means that we are learning every day. Having said that, we do have good insights into our wholesaler and distributor partners from a reporting standpoint. What we\u2019re learning is it\u2019s a very efficient channel. And so we\u2019ve got good insights there. As I said earlier, we are seeing that start to build. And then the second stage of that is when our product gets stopped in retail pharmacies. And so that\u2019s also very early days as we get our contracts put in place for the CVSs, the Walgreens and other retail pharmacies in the U.S. And so I think we\u2019ll see inventories start to build more in both of those as that channel matures. And then on the DME side of things, we\u2019re very experienced in this area, have a very good handle on our inventories with our DME partners and manage it along with them. And so we feel confident there as well and understanding those. And we did see those come down somewhat this quarter and it offset the build we saw on the pharmacy. So on a net basis between the two channels, we did not see a channel inventory build this quarter. Shacey Petrovic : The only thing I\u2019ll add, and Wayde\u2019s right. As the channel grows, we would expect for inventory to grow to support that, but the pharmacy is proving to be a very efficient channel. So the inventory turns very quickly and it gets distributed very quickly. So it\u2019s something we\u2019re keeping a close eye on and we will give as much color as we feel is necessary to make sure you guys have a good handle on what\u2019s going on in the business. Matt O\u2019Brien: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then the follow up is for Wayde actually on the gross margin side. Your [indiscernible] sometime next year, how do we think about the headwinds there on the gross margin line from those two lines that come out over the next year or so? And [indiscernible] see things improve and then how do you manage [indiscernible] efficient, et cetera? Thank you. Wayde McMillan : Yes. So, Matt, you were a bit in and out there, but I think I got the gist of your question around gross margins. And this is one of our most significant investment areas, right. In automated manufacturing here in the U.S., many advantages to that, right. We get the redundancy and it is going to be the single largest contributor to us getting to our long-term 70% plus gross margin targets over time. What it does mean is this investment is going to create a headwind for us and it is here in the second half of '19 as we start to ramp up our first line. And then as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we\u2019re bringing in a second and a third line in 2020. So we will be adding to the headwinds here as we work through 2020. And then the plan is, we\u2019re learning on line one already. We are already making adjustments that we\u2019re learning that we\u2019re implementing on line two and line three. We feel really good about the talented team, the capability that we\u2019re building here. And so we\u2019re going to be able to leverage this capacity. And then what it comes down to is volume. So as we start to scale, we move from putting very inefficient cost of goods sold inventory into inventory and moving it to more efficient cost of goods sold in inventory. So there\u2019ll be an inflection point. We\u2019re not giving guidance for 2020 yet, but you can assume that we\u2019ll be having the majority of our headwind throughout 2020 as we ramp the first line and we bring in our second and third line, and that will position us well for efficiencies over the long term. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Taylor with UBS. Your line is open. Matt Taylor : Thank you for taking the question. I was hoping first, you could be a little bit more descriptive about the international market dynamics. What are you seeing there that\u2019s similar and different to the U.S. in terms of patient mix in Type 2, and talk a little bit more about next year? You mentioned entering some meaningful new markets. What are they and how much growth do they have? Shacey Petrovic : Sure. Thanks, Matt. The first question on international markets, it\u2019s a little challenging to answer because if you think about our international markets or Europe, when we refer to Europe, Europe has actually a dozen different business models, different reimbursement schemes and different access availabilities for the technology. So I would say that the percentage of, for example, Type 1 and Type 2 varies dramatically across the market depending on the access restrictions. But by and large, in these national healthcare systems, there is less access for Type 2 that will take some market development work over the long term to unlock that population, but fairly good and established access for people living with Type 1 diabetes. And certainly what we see across every international market that we\u2019re in today is that we have a differentiated technology that is patient preferred and growing pretty dramatically across these markets and that\u2019s evidenced by the performance this year and what we expect for Q4. And I think -- Matt Taylor : The second one was just around the new markets, I think, what were they expecting? Shacey Petrovic : Yes. And so as we give a little bit of color, I wouldn\u2019t expect us to add material revenue in 2021. We\u2019re not going to list out the markets, but really talking about a handful of markets in 2020. We\u2019ve got a lot of work to do in 2020 to convert our markets to DASH and then to start to think about new markets to enter into. And I\u2019m really excited about the opportunity. But right now, we want to make sure that we enter these markets in the right way. When we make a commitment to a market, we\u2019re making a commitment for the rest of a patient\u2019s life. And so we\u2019re being really thoughtful about the markets that we select. I would expect that those will be the first tranche. In 2020 will be in Europe and potentially the Middle East. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. Your line is open. Raj Denhoy : Hi. Good evening. Maybe just a question for you, Shacey, on Horizon. I guess I\u2019m curious about how confident you are in the timing of the late 2020 approval or the second half of 2020 as you described it. With the trial just starting, it\u2019s essentially a year from now. And I guess given the unique nature of the product with the algorithms residing on the Pod itself, is there any risk that that timing could slip a little bit? Shacey Petrovic : I appreciate the question. I feel great actually about the timeline. We\u2019ve got a terrific team developing this and Dr. Trang Ly leading it, who is arguably one of the world\u2019s experts in artificial pancreas research and development. We also I think really benefit from some great regulatory tailwinds. Remember, we\u2019ve got an iCGM that is already cleared. We\u2019ve got an ACE pump that is already cleared. And what we\u2019re working on is the algorithm clearance and the system clearance. So we\u2019ve got a lot of tailwinds behind us and we also benefit from the breakthrough devices program. And just to give a little color there, I think this last pre-sub with the agency is the seventh one we\u2019ve had this year. So the level of collaboration and support on behalf of the agency has just been fantastic. So if you think about the timeline, we feel like we\u2019re in really good shape. This trial will take approximately three months and then we\u2019ll move into compilation and submission and we feel confident that we\u2019ll be on the market in the second half of next year. Raj Denhoy : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that does end today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Ms. Shacey Petrovic for any closing remarks. Shacey Petrovic : Thanks, everyone. Just a few weeks ago, Insulet was awarded the 2019 Massachusetts Economic Impact Award, the result of substantial investment and job creation we have made in Central Massachusetts. This award has been presented since 2003 to honor companies that have made a significant impact on the Massachusetts economy. And just last week, Insulet UK was awarded the Medical Device Company of the Year by Diabetes Professional Care Association, which celebrates standards of excellence, quality and positive outcomes led by companies working in the diabetes community. I want to congratulate our entire team for taking home these goals, a great recognition of everybody\u2019s terrific execution and our deep commitment to our mission. We are just so proud to be making such a positive impact in our local communities and to be making a positive impact on people with diabetes across the globe. Thanks and have a great evening.

At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Deborah Gordon : Thank you, Lauren. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today for Insulet\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings call. Joining me are Shacey Petrovic, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Wayde McMillan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The replay of this call will be archived on our website and the press release discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2019 results and first quarter and full year 2020 guidance is also available in the IR section of our website. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations. We ask that you please refer to the cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements. We also will discuss the non-GAAP financial measure, adjusted EBITDA with respect to our guidance. We have transitioned to adjusted EBITDA as it aligns with what management uses as a supplemental measure in adjusting our operating performance and we believe that it is helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties as a measure of our comparative operating performance from period to period. Also, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis. With that, I'll turn the call over to Shacey. Shacey Petrovic : Thanks, Deb, and good afternoon, everyone. 2019 was an exciting year. We celebrated the achievement of many milestones. Our strong financial and operational performance reflected the culmination of several years of strategic discipline to create a strong foundation from which Insulet can grow and evolve. And we did so of staying true to our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes. Throughout 2019, we made great progress advancing our strategic imperatives. And in 2020, we remain focused on driving our initiatives forward. Specifically, one to deliver consumer focused innovation, two, ensure the best global customer experience. Three, expand our global footprint, and four, drive operational excellence. As we look ahead, we are confident that the execution of our strategy is driving sustainable long-term growth and value creation. The global Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes markets represent approximately 10 million insulin requiring individuals, in just the countries we are in today. This large, underserved and growing global market opportunity represents a tremendous opportunity that Insulet is uniquely positioned to capture. We are on track to achieve our 2021 financial targets, and excited about our additional catalysts for growth over the long term. During today's call, I will share our financial highlights, and provide an overview of our recent strategic progress. I will then turn the call over to Wayde who will discuss our financial results in greater detail, and share our 2020 outlook. Our fourth quarter results marked another strong quarter of financial performance and closed out an exceptional 2019 for Insulet. We generated more than $209 million in revenue exceeding the high end of our guidance by $8 million and representing a 27% increase year-over-year. This was driven by 30% revenue growth in our total Omnipod product line, with both our U.S. and international operations continuing to execute and drive strong operational performance. We also achieved another record quarter of global new iPod users. On a full year basis, we delivered consistent financial outperformance throughout 2019. We generated $738 million in revenue representing a 31% increase, driven by 36% revenue growth in our total Omnipod product line. We also improved annual operating profitability which Wayde will speak to shortly. Our Insulet team continues to knock it out of the park with focus, execution and an intense drive to deliver on our mission in order to provide the best value to all of our stakeholders. I'll now share additional color on the progress we made executing our strategy, starting with innovation. We continued to advance our efforts to deliver products that are easy to use, simple, and improve quality of life and outcomes for our consumers. In 2019, we completed the launch of Omnipod DASH in the United States, and in December, we introduced DASH to select European markets. As many of you know, our Omnipod DASH system utilizes a mobile app on a locked down phone, to provide consumers, intuitive simplicity and unparalleled ease of use. With the launch of DASH we are one step closer to consumers being able to control their pods with their own personal smartphones. This is the top request we get from the diabetes community and Omnipod Horizon will make it a reality. With DASH, we are disrupting the market with our unique pay-as-you go business model. Omnipod DASH is the only insulin pump on the U.S. market that can be accessed with no upfront cost and no four year lock in period. We are shifting the old market paradigm by eliminating restrictions, so more people can easily access our technology without having to wait for their lock-in period to end, and without having to pay large upfront costs. As a result, we are providing access to a much broader patient population. This business model allows us to better serve the Type 2 diabetes market, which Omnipod DASH is uniquely positioned to address. While doctors have historically been less willing to prescribe pump therapy for their Type 2 patients, they now tell us they are increasingly recommending Omnipod DASH for this population as an alternative to multiple daily injections. Our platform is easy to use and requires minimal training, so users of all ages and backgrounds are quickly up and running on the system. As a result, for the third consecutive quarter, we saw another notable increase in the percentage of our new Omnipod users through the pharmacy being individuals living with Type 2 diabetes. To put this into perspective, in Q4, almost 30% of our U.S. new Omnipod users were Type 2. We are confident that Type 2 users who try Omnipod DASH realize its many benefits. This trend is already evident in our results and we expect it to continue to gain momentum. Also encouraging is the momentum Omnipod DASH and growing market access have created as they continue to fuel the number of total new Omnipod users. In Q4, we saw an increase to over 80% of us new Omnipod users coming from multiple daily injections, which is slightly greater than our historical average. Omnipod with the benefit of the pay-as-you-go model business model in the pharmacy continues to lead the way as a category grower, helping more people get the benefits of pump therapy. And growth of Omnipod DASH continues to be in line with pharmacy access. The successful commercial launch of Omnipod DASH and resulting market access wins are paving the way for our innovation pipeline. We're making good progress on Omnipod powered by Horizon, the first ever tubeless, personal smartphone controlled, automated insulin delivery system. Omnipod Horizon has several key differentiators. One, it is designed for greater time in closed loop. Two, it will provide unparalleled personalized therapy and three, it can be controlled by a user's personal smartphone. In December, we completed pre pivotal testing and moved into our pivotal study, which will support our FDA submission. Demand for trial participation has been incredible, with people willing to fly across the country for the last remaining spots, which have now been filled. In fact within weeks, the majority of our sites completed enrolment, and in total, our pivotal includes approximately 240 individuals, ages 6 to 70 years old. All participants will complete a three month outpatient study. It is important to note that our participants include paediatrics and also individuals coming from both MDI and pump therapy, not just the better controlled adult population or well controlled patients already using pump therapy. This is another differentiator compared to other AID Systems. We are incredibly excited that study participants are wearing our system at home as part of this final stage of testing, and feedback has been terrific. Investigators and participants have shared many amazing stories of how Omnipod Horizon will be a game changer, and transform the diabetes landscape for automated insulin delivery. Mothers who can finally sleep through the night, while their child is well controlled. Children who are maintaining tight glucose control through dance recitals and pizza parties, and adults who are experiencing quality of life improvements as a result of their ability to more easily manage their diabetes. We will share clinical results of our Omnipod Horizon study at the American Diabetes Association conference in June, and one of our principal investigators was invited by ADA to present our pre pivotal data in a special session. We also expect the data for our pivotal testing to be completed later this summer, and we will share it either in publication or at a conference later this year. Another key aspect of Omnipods Horizon's innovative power is its design incorporating the algorithm on the pod. This should allow the user to remain in closed loop for a longer period of time as compared to other systems. The user does not need a device to keep the on body Pod and CGM sensor in direct communication. In order to accomplish this, we have worked in close collaboration with Dexcom, a long standing partner. We are really excited to have recently announced an agreement that builds on our integration efforts, formalizes our commercial launch plans, and includes access to integrate Dexcom\u2019s next-generation G7 CGM into Omnipod Horizon. Our Horizon effort with Dexcom is an illustration of just one of several partnerships we have established to deliver an innovative AID platform that will bring freedom and simplicity to people living with insulin dependent diabetes. We also recently announced a collaboration with Abbott, another longstanding partner to bring together the power of our Omnipod Horizon platform and Abbott's next generation Libre sensor. This on body system will provide patients with choice of CGM sensor in an intuitive, automated insulin delivery system. Libre has had a remarkable adoption trajectory recently celebrating more than 2 million users across the globe. And it\u2019s very exciting to think about the broad impact our technologies together can have on people living with diabetes. We believe a simple design, sensor of choice and personalization will provide outcomes without complexity. The differentiators of our Omnipod platform position us to further penetrate the global diabetes market, including those living with Type 2. Due to this incredibly large opportunity, we have prioritized these development efforts over our concentrated insulin development programs in order to shift resources toward maximizing our AID development efforts with our sensor partners. Our rationale for this change is a matter of priority based on market opportunity. We believe the benefits of our technology platform together with our expanded collaboration with Abbott and Dexcom provide a pathway to move more rapidly and effectively into a much larger, addressable Type 2 diabetes market. We are excited to partner with Dexcom and Abbott to deliver consumer focused innovation that will provide benefits to a larger population, and build off our current strategy that is already proving to be a winning approach to driving Omnipod adoption. Innovation is a top priority here at Insulet. We will continue to invest in growth opportunities to accelerate our pipeline and help us bring greater advancements to more people with diabetes around the world. Now turning to our global expansion. We made tremendous progress in 2019 strengthening our global footprint and securing our leadership position in geographies with large, addressable markets. By the end of 2019, we introduced Omnipod DASH in select European markets, and we expect to further roll it out across Europe and Canada this year. Additionally, last month we announced that we expect to enter five new markets this year specifically in Europe, and the Middle East where we see significant demand and long term value creation potential. Omnipod DASH is the preferred platform for our new markets and we are encouraged by the positive feedback we've received from our European early adopters. While we don't expect our European or our international expansion to add meaningful revenue in 2020, we are confident that we are taking the right steps to drive significant and sustainable revenue growth over the long term. Finally, turning to our manufacturing innovation and global operational excellence. First, I would like to acknowledge that as we all deal with the global challenges of the coronavirus and its impact on families, employees and the operations of many global organizations; it highlights the importance of our investment in manufacturing, and supply chain redundancy. In May of last year, we began production on our first highly automated state of the art manufacturing line in the United States. In doing so, we not only developed valuable internal manufacturing expertise, we also added redundancy, expanded capacity, and strengthened our supply chain. Possessing the ability and internal expertise to manufacture our own products at scale, and manage the complexity of our supply chain are critical to support our rapid growth and long term capacity needs. We are in the middle of ramping up our first U.S. manufacturing line, and starting line 2 with production of sellable product and the second line expected by mid-year. We also remain on track to install our third manufacturing line in the United States later this year with sellable product next year. With our focus on driving efficiency and effectiveness, we have created significant competitive advantages that we expect will drive long term cost reductions across our manufacturing and supply chain operations. It does take time to ramp the lines given the complexity and scope of this effort. And while this ramp is a headwind to margins in the near term, our manufacturing innovation is a key driver of our 2021 70% gross margin target, which we remain on track to deliver. As we look ahead, we remain focused on continuing to execute our initiatives and strategy to invest in our long term growth opportunities. I'll now turn the call over to Wayde. Wayde McMillan : Thank you Shacey. As Shacey noted, we had a terrific 2019 and consistently outperformed during the year, our fourth quarter financial and operational performance was no exception. We are confident that continued execution of our strategic imperatives with a focus on investing for growth will create additional value for our stakeholders and further our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we delivered revenue of $209.4 million representing growth of 27% which was $8 million above our quarterly guidance range. By product line U.S. Omnipod revenue grew 36% to $126.7 million almost $7 million above the high end of our guidance range and marked our fifth consecutive quarter of accelerating growth in the United States. This was mainly driven by increased volume from our growing customer base, and increased adoption of our new product innovation with Omnipod DASH primarily through the pharmacy channel. Also contributing was the mix benefit on the premium for Omnipod DASH. Volume growth of Omnipod DASH drove approximately 55% of our U.S. new Omnipod users in the fourth quarter. We grew our U.S. volume through the pharmacy channel to over 25% of our total. Also driving the growth of our U.S. to Omnipod users is our strategic focus on the Type 2 diabetes market. For the full year, we realized a PDM headwind of $3 million compared to our guidance of $4 million to $6 million resulting from the continued strength of selling PDM\u2019s into our DME and direct channels. As a reminder, our new innovative business model eliminates the upfront cost for the DASH PDM and removes hurdles for adopting Pod therapy. International Omnipod revenue in the fourth quarter grew 20% to $65.8 million, achieving the high end of our guidance range, primarily driven by increased volume in Europe, as we continue to drive demand in our existing markets as well as less of a negative headwind from foreign exchange assumed in guidance. Excluding the 2% negative FX impact in the quarter, international Omnipod revenue grew 22% on a constant currency basis. Drug delivery revenue was $16.9 million, an increase of 1% exceeding the high end of our guidance range by $2 million, as a result of our partners updated forecast. Turning to gross margin, we delivered 64% in Q4, down 290 basis points year-over-year and 10 basis points sequentially. Q4 gross margin ended slightly below Q3 as U.S. manufacturing costs were higher in Q4 than planned. Partially offsetting these headwinds was favorable mix, from increased volume of Omnipod DASH in the U.S. primarily through the pharmacy channel. We expect the headwinds of U.S. manufacturing ramp to continue in 2020. As Shacey noted, despite these short term headwinds, we are confident that our investment in manufacturing innovation will contribute to meaningful gross margin expansion over the long term. For the full year 2019, gross margin of 65.1% was 60 basis points below prior year, in line with our expectations. Full year gross margin was impacted by the ramp of our first U.S. manufacturing line during the year, partially offset by the mix benefit in the U.S. from the premium for Omnipod DASH and the pharmacy as well as the benefit in the first half of the year from direct operations in Europe. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter were 55% of revenue compared to 57% in the prior year in line with our expectations. Operating income for the fourth quarter was $18.2 million representing 8.7% of revenue. On a full year basis, operating income was $50 million or 6.8% of revenue slightly exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Net income for the fourth quarter was $5 million and included a onetime non-cash charge of $2.3 million relating to the extinguishment of the remaining 35% of the 2021 convertible notes. This charge was slightly better than our original estimate of $3 million due to the timing of the extinguishment. We ended the year with $435 million in cash and investments compared to $637 million at the end of the third quarter and $430 million at the end of last year. This sequential decrease from Q3 was primarily due to the $210 million we use to repurchase the remaining 2021 notes. We ended 2019 with accelerated revenue growth, improved profitability, and a solid global commercial and operational foundation, positioning us for continued growth over the long term. I will now walk you through our 2020 expectations, beginning with full year guidance. For the full year, we expect reported revenue growth for total Omnipod in the range of 17% to 21% and reported revenue growth for total company in the range of 14% to 18% with both including an approximate 1% negative foreign currency impact. By product line, we expect U.S. Omnipod revenue of 18% to 22%. This reflects continued volume growth of Omnipod DASH primarily in the pharmacy channel and continued Omnipod adoption in Type 1 and Type 2 markets, as well as expanding market access. We will also continue to benefit from the DASH pod premium in the pharmacy as part of the pay-as-you-go strategy to provide PDM\u2019s for no charge. As a reminder, we launched Omnipod DASH at the end of the first quarter of last year and began generating revenue for DASH at the start of the second quarter. Therefore our first half 2020 growth rate will benefit from annualizing the first full year of Omnipod DASH and move into the pharmacy. As a result, we expect our growth rates to be stronger in the first half than in the second half of 2020 as we anniversary the DASH launch. We expect full year 2020 international Omnipod revenue in the range of 16% to 20% reflecting continued strength in our existing markets. This growth rate includes an approximate 2% negative foreign currency impact. As previously mentioned, we plan to expand into new countries within Europe and the Middle East, and although we don't expect these new markets to contribute materially to 2020 revenue, we are laying a strong foundation for revenue expansion over the long term. Lastly for drug delivery, we expect a decline of 15% to 20% based on our partner\u2019s current forecast. For the first quarter of 2020, we expect total Omnipod growth of 23% to 26% and total company revenue growth of 17% to 20% with both including an approximate 1% negative foreign currency impact. This growth is primarily driven by increased Omnipod volume globally. This includes U.S. Omnipod revenue growth of 27% to 29% versus prior year Q1, which did not include on Omnipod DASH. Our first quarter reflects growing Omnipod volume as we continue to expand market access and drive growth within both the Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes markets. We expect international Omnipod revenue growth of 17% to 20% including an approximate 3% negative foreign currency impact. This growth is primarily driven by increased volume growth, as we continue to drive penetration in our existing markets. And lastly, we expect a decline in drug delivery revenue of 28% to 34% based upon our partner\u2019s current forecast. Now turning to the rest of the 2020 P&L on a full year basis. We expect full year gross margin to be relatively consistent with the prior year. As we previously communicated, we expect to continue to experience short term gross margin headwinds in 2020, as we ramp two additional, highly automated manufacturing lines and our move toward operational efficiency. As a reminder, it typically takes up to two years to reach full capacity on each line. We installed our first line in May of last year, and we're making progress everyday. We continue to expect to begin production of solar product on our second manufacturing line by mid-year, also contributing to the short term headwind. As we continue to ramp U.S. manufacturing and gain efficiencies, we expect second half of 2020 gross margin to improve over the first half. Despite these short term headwinds, we are confident that as we optimize and grow volumes, we will achieve our 2021 gross margin target of 70%. Overall in 2020, our financial strategy entails. Continued investment in our innovation pipeline including our Omnipod Horizon clinical trial and anticipated launch, expansion of our commercial initiatives globally, and investment in the ramp of our U.S. manufacturing lines for capacity expansion, redundancy and cost efficiencies. We therefore expect to deliver full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA in the mid-teens percentage range. Finally, we expect capital expenditures to be relatively consistent with 2019 as we continue to expand capacity in our U.S. operations, build our global infrastructure, and invest in innovation to support our growth and profitability objectives. In summary, 2019 was a terrific year, and 2020 will benefit from the momentum as we further execute our strategy. We will continue to invest for growth, both in innovation and commercial, expand it to new countries, watch Omnipod DASH across Europe and Canada, and we look forward to the U.S. launch of Omnipod Horizon. We continue to execute on our strategic objectives, and make a positive impact on the lives of our customers. We remain solidly on track to deliver our 2021 targets of $1 billion in revenue, gross margin of 70% and operating income in the mid-teens. With that I'll turn the call back to Shacey for concluding remarks. Shacey Petrovic : Thanks Wayde. 2019 was a tremendous year for Insulet as we made significant progress on our strategic initiatives. We are now beginning to realize the positive impact from these efforts. It is clear that we have a sound strategy and thanks to the hard work and dedication of the entire Insulet team, we entered 2020 in a position of strength. And now I'll turn the call back to Lauren for Q&A. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Matthew O'Brien: Hi, afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Just I guess for starters here, the Q1 guide as far as the U.S. number goes is a bigger sequential drop than we've seen over the last couple of years, and I guess your revenue base is bigger, but could you just talk a little bit about your thought process on that Q1 guide? Is there anything of note that's going in there, maybe some more attrition through the pharmacy etcetera that has surprised you a little bit, or is \u2013 is that just a bit of conservatism? Wayde McMillan : Hi, Matt. It\u2019s Wayde. So first of all thanks for the call and for the question. For our U.S. guidance, we feel that 18% to 22% is a strong guide for the year, and for Q1 that you referenced 27% to 29%, also a strong guide. There were a couple of key drivers that give us confidence here. I mentioned that the first half benefits from DASH in the pharmacy, does create a tougher time for us in the second half. So we have the Q1 guide here above the full year. We have a larger percentage, you know 30% of our new patient starts in Q4 or coming from Type 2 and we're positioned very well there. So a lot of reasons that we're confident in the 27% to 29%. We are aware of one now and a potential second new competitive AID out there in the marketplace in 2020, so we do think it will create some noise in the marketplace. We haven't seen that in Q1. And so that's why we're confident in this guide. So yes, I think to the second part of your question that this is just a standard guidance practice for us, we feel comfortable and that a 27% to 29% guide in the U.S. is a strong guide. Matthew O'Brien: Okay. That's fair. And then flipping over to Horizon for a second, one of those AID companies mentioned yesterday on their call that they have a delay in one of their products because of the link to the phone, specifically, so I don't think I heard you say yes, we're on track for the Horizon and your timeframe, specifically. Can you talk a little bit about that, and then when exactly did you finish enrollment in the pivotal? Thank you. Shacey Petrovic : Yes, Matt. Thanks for the question. We remain on track for launch at the end of this year. We've got all 240 trial participants on the system. So right now, we're about 35% of the way through the trial and learning a ton as you might imagine. So just to give a little bit more color there, we're seeing certain typical things you would see when you send users home with a new system like this for the first time. But obviously, that's why you do trials like this, and the team is doing a great job collecting and addressing these learnings and kind of supporting our sites across the country so making good progress there. And when do we exactly finish enrolment? It was within weeks of opening enrolment. So I don't know the exact date. But very early on. Demand was pretty incredible. And feedback from the trial participants has been frankly emotional and gratifying. So it's no doubt that consumer demand is really high and we're working very hard to collect, address learnings from the trial and get the system to market as quickly as possible. But nothing changed in our timeline. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Robbie Marcus : Thanks. Wanting to just follow-up on the guidance, Wayde. Because you have such a strong first quarter guidance and it's a recurring revenue business. And I do realize there is some mix benefits that that'll go away as more and more patients are in the pharmacy with some price premium you're getting as the installed base upgrades. But it seems like such a sharp decline in the second half of the year for the recurring revenue business after such strong growth in 2019. How should we really be thinking about the drivers of maybe price mix and volume? What's assumed in your guidance there for the U.S. growth number? Thanks. Wayde McMillan : Yes. Hi Robbie. So yes, I can try to add a little more perspective to the guidance, particular to the U.S. here with your question. One way to think about it is that we have similar close to the same year-over-year growth dollars that we had in 2019, which was a very strong growth year for us with DASH in the pharmacy in earnest ramping in the second half. And so, we do see the benefit in 2020 of the second couple quarters of annualizing the strategic moves for launching DASH and for moving into the pharmacy. Horizon does not have a material impact to revenue in 2020 until it ramps in 2021. So we feel that dollar growth similar to the strong year we had in 2019 with momentum coming here into the first half of 2020 is the right level and we're going to start the year there and we're going to monitor as many dynamics in the marketplace that we're monitoring. We'll keep those tabs on them and see how we progress here throughout the year. Robbie Marcus : Okay. And I'm sorry if you touched on this in the prepared remarks. I'm jumping across a couple of different calls tonight. But can you touch on your supply chain in China and any impact from coronavirus? How manufacturing in China is? How much safety stock you have? And if you foresee any potential supply disruptions here? Thanks. Shacey Petrovic : Yes Robbie. It's a great question. And I want to first just commend our team because they are managing through this incredibly capably and we do not anticipate any product supply issues due to the coronavirus at this time. As we mentioned earlier our automated facility in the U.S. is starting to provide manufacturing redundancy and risk medication and additional capacity as line one ramps and then we bring line two on. And we've got our best people frankly on this here and on the ground in Shenzhen. We have a comprehensive plan in place to make sure that we've got risk mitigation. So plenty of inventory on hand. And then acting continues to produce more and more every day. And then our facility in Shenzhen is also up and producing again. So I think we right now feel as if we are in a solid position and the team is managing this incredibly closely monitoring it every day and making sure that we're proactively putting mitigation plans in place. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. David Lewis : Good afternoon. Thank you. Wayde, I guess just to be very clear about you U.S. guidance because I guess I'm surprised by a few of the questions here. Said very simply, your growth rate in the fourth quarter of 2019 is about 20 points faster than the growth rate in the first quarter. So really what you're saying is your guidance reflects stable momentum in the business. You just going to anniversary harder comps in the back half of the year? Wayde McMillan : That's correct David Lewis : Okay. Very clear. Thank you. And just ex-U.S. Ex-U.S. business momentum was slowed a little bit into the back half of the year. Your guidance for 2020 is actually very consistent with what you said over the last couple of months. Can you just sort of walk us through back half 2019 dynamics and your confidence in the 2020 ex-U.S. guidance? And then I had a quick question for Shacey. Wayde McMillan : Hey, David. Exactly, as you said our long stated guidance here for international has been high-teens, low 20s. We feel that that's the range that we can continue to grow in outside the U.S. And so our OUS guidance is 18% to 22% FX is right in that guidance range and right where we expect the region to be. We also have a strong Q1 guide in international. We typically have better focus or better insight into the pipeline for the shorter quarters. And so we've taken up that range on an ex FX basis to 20%, 23%. That's above the high-teens low 20s to start the year. But overall, now that we've annualized going direct in Europe, we have a good handle on our business by region. We still sell through distributors for most regions and therefore we have to account for some uncertainty there, as well as potential for some attrition. But overall, I think guiding to this business in the high-teens, low 20s is where we should expect us to be. We think we're going to start the year a little stronger just by insight to the pipeline. David Lewis : Okay. And then, Shacey, just one of the things that's happened last couple quarters has been this T2 momentum. It's just gone from basically 15% to 20% to 30% over the last six months. I guess the question is, that's pretty remarkable inflexmen [ph]. Where can that go this year or long term? Thanks so much. Shacey Petrovic : Sure. David, it's a great question. I think it's still early days and there's a lot of wood to chop in Type 2, I think about pharmacy, I think about only being a year into our business and launching a new product in Europe. So, I just want to caution where I -- and I guess put that into context where I think it can go. But Type 2 is an incredibly exciting opportunity for us. We have good access there. It's an incredibly large opportunity. We believe it's twice at least the size of the Type 1 opportunity in the United States. And we're seeing great results both anecdotally from clinicians and users and just obviously we've got data around reduction of total daily dose of insulin and other specific outcomes in that patient population. So, we think that we're just scratching the surface and just getting started and that we've got a long runway frankly providing this technology to people who are underserved in this market and a patient population where clinicians don't have a lot of great tools. And DASH is a great tool in this patient segment. So I think it's going to hang with us for a while. We're really excited about the potential and we're going to continue to invest to unlock the opportunity. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson with Baird. Your line is open. Jeff Johnson : Thank you good afternoon guys. Shacey, I want to ask you maybe just two follow-up questions. One, on the decision to maybe sideline the concentrated insulins here. You've kind of turned down some of the drug delivery efforts. It seems like now on the concentrated insulins. That would imply there's a lot of other stuff going on I'd assume over the next couple of years. And really beyond Horizon, what is coming next? What is taking up so much of that bandwidth? And I just want to make sure on the concentrated insulin side, there's not an issue with the data itself or the product itself, it's more of a bandwidth issue? Shacey Petrovic : Right. Jeff, that's true. This is not an issue with the data itself or the product itself. It is about essentially having to make the tough choices as a leadership team that we have to make. I think the great thing about insulins is that we are in the position to have multiple growth opportunities and programs and potential steps that we can take in front of us and our job is to make those tough decisions and prioritize the ones that we think are going to drive the most value for the organization. And right now with the addition of both Abbott, Libre and DexCom's next generation sensor, we believe that those combined have the potential to be more attractive opportunities in terms of the market size. And how quickly we can use them to drive into those market opportunities. It doesn't really diminish our enthusiasm. We look at concentrated insulins as an attractive opportunity. It just means we have more attractive opportunities. And in terms of the pipeline we haven't been public with our entire pipeline. There's a lot going on here. But one thing we have said is that we believe that Omnipod powered by Horizon is a platform that can continue to evolve and grow and bring value to both people living with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. And so we've got really exciting plans on that front to continue to bring iterations of that platform into the marketplace. And so this is I think the right decision. It's all driven by a number of analysis that we do to kind of evaluate one program versus the other. I think the team did a rigorous evaluation and this prioritization level is the right prioritization. Jeff Johnson : Understood. And then maybe just a question on the horizon pivotal. So if it closed or it was fully enrolled a few weeks after it started, so let's say at least by the end of January it's a three-month study. I mean just to push you a little bit. Is there any chance we could see some of that pivotal data at ADA. It sounded like it wasn't sure from your comments, if we're going to see pivotal data. I know you said pre-pivotal, but also checking on the pivotal data. And then it wouldn't seem crazy to me if the study complete, at least primary completion by May-ish three months at the FDA or a month to kind of get the data together. I mean could we be seeing approval sometime late this summer or do we really think deeper into the second half of this year? Thank you. Shacey Petrovic : Yes. Jeff, you sound like me with the team. But I'll say -- so when we say completely enrolled it then takes a while for people to actually get on the product, right. They're enrolled as trial participants and then they need to be seen and put on the product to be able to participate in the trial and that takes some time. So it doesn't happen overnight. We expect from this trial to have about 21,000 patient-wearing days collected over the course of the pivotal and we've got about 8,000 patient-wearing days under our belt. So we've still got some time to go. And so I think a lot to learn in that process. I'm hesitant to kind of provide a more aggressive timeline. I think later this year as what we've said and that feels right to me. Based on all the work that still needs to happen. But I think, we are excited about the program. just learning every day and I want to be cautious about how we guide about this. Because I think -- I do think it's going to take some time for us to collect that data, react to the data, determine any learnings that we want to incorporate before we move forward with the commercial final product. All that stuff still has to happen. So teams are committed. We've got great people on it. And it's going to be, I think a terrific product. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Blicker with Cowen. Your line is open. Ryan Blicker : Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. A couple on U.S. revenue. What was U.S. installed base growth versus 30% U.S. revenue growth you posted in 2019? And what does U.S. guidance assume for installed base growth in 2020? And then, on the Q3 call you talked about expecting some stocking associated with the move to the pharmacy channel in the future. Did any stocking occur in the U.S. in Q4? And then I have a follow up. Wayde McMillan : Hi, Ryan, it's Wayde. So, we're not providing quantifying installed base at this time. But what we said in Shacey's prepared remarks that it was another record new patient start quarter for us. So we added more customers to our installed base in Q4 than we had in any quarter before that. So that's about all we can say on that at this point. And then regarding Q3 stocking, we did not see stocking again in Q4. So what we're learning about our pharmacy channel is that it's very efficient. And we did see some net channel build on the pharmacy side, but it was offset by reductions on the DME side of the business, which is a different channel. So on a net basis for Q4 in the U.S., we did not see any channel build. However, we did see some build in the pharmacy offset by the DME and the more wholesalers and distributors that we add to our distribution channel here, we're learning. It's a very efficient channel. We do think that over time that we will start to see a channel build once we settle out on the DME side of the business and we continue to add channel partners on the pharmacy side. And then eventually when we start to add more inventory into the retail end of the channel we would expect some channel build there. Having said that, we're not reflecting it in our guidance at this point, because we do not -- we can't time when we think that's going to happen. So, we see a material amount of channel inventory build, we'll certainly call it up for you. Ryan Blicker : Got it. Okay. And then two Type 2 questions Have you seen any notable difference in utilization or attrition amongst your Type 2 users versus the overall installed base? And you've been following the U.S. Type 2 total addressable market as 2.5 million to 3 million patients, which is a bit above what other companies have talked about. Can you talk a bit about your confidence in that estimate and how you got to it? Thank you. Shacey Petrovic : Sure. I'll start with the first question which was just change in utilization habits. And we haven't noted a change in utilization or attrition with the Type 2. But when I say there's still a lot of wood to chop that's kind of what I'm referring to. It's early days with the Type 2 user population. We've seen a notable tick up. But it's a little early to conclusively say attrition isn't different or utilization isn't different. So we're certainly monitoring those trends carefully. And to date we haven't seen a notable difference. And then the question regarding the estimates. So that comes -- we triangulate on that number from a bunch of external market research reports, the IDF Atlas and internal data. And one difference might be sometimes other organizations will haircut based on access. And remember Omnipod has pretty solid access in the Type 2 population. And so we don't necessarily have the same haircut that other companies might. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Jayson Bedford : Hi. Good afternoon. Just a couple semi follow-up questions. Appreciate the comments around Type 2 as a percent of your new users in the fourth quarter. What is the current Type 2 mix in the context to your installed base? Shacey Petrovic : So, I didn't catch that Jayson. When did the Type 2\u2026 Jayson Bedford : The mix of the\u2026 Shacey Petrovic : Oh, I see overall mix. We haven't get it an updated number there. The last number that we gave was that it was 15% to 20% of the total base. Jayson Bedford : Okay. Maybe for Wayde. On the U.S. guide you mentioned the new AID system hasn't impacted your business to-date. But you did mention the device in reference to your U.S. business. So, I guess the question is, does the guidance contemplate a more competitive impact in quarters two through four? Wayde McMillan : So maybe -- hey, Jayson. To start with, we do see and monitor things in our marketplace. And we recognize that there's one out there now and potential for a second. So that was really my comment that just how we get to our guidance is looking at the market factors out there. Having said that, given 80% of our new Omnipod customers come from MDI, we don't rely on two pump renewal cycles for the most part. And so, we do think it will create some noise in the U.S. market and we're going to monitor that piece of it closely. But having said that, we haven't factored into a major impact to our guidance range. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with SVP Leerink. Your line is open. Danielle Antalffy.: Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on a really strong 2019. Sorry to harp on the guidance. But just wanted to peel back the onion a little bit more if we could. Because even on a comp adjusted basis, I mean, really every quarter in 2019 in the U.S. you accelerated revenue growth. And I appreciate that comps get tougher. But it feels like the momentum is actually going in the other direction i.e. you're just continuing to accelerate. So I just want to make sure I'm not missing something or is this sort of more just prudent conservatism on your part as it relates to the guidance? Wayde McMillan : Yes. So, hey Danielle, it's Wayde. So from a guidance standpoint, it sounds like this is a popular topic this quarter. Again, we do take a thoughtful approach. We include internal factors, external factors. We build our bottoms up assumptions. And there's nothing out of the ordinary here. What we're not going to do is factor in record new patients start growth every quarter, quarter-on-quarter for four quarters. We're going to take a thoughtful approach here. I did give the context to that our dollar growth is close to the dollar growth we had in 2019 and that brings us to for the U.S. an 18% to 22% growth rate. So we feel that is a strong guide for the year. We see some strength in the first quarters. So our Q1 guide is above that and we feel very comfortable where we're at, and we'll continue to assess it as the year goes along. Danielle Antalffy.: Okay. Totally fair. And then as we think about Horizon, I mean first of all assume nothing is really in the -- I don't want to put words in your mouth. But I assume nothing is really in the 2020 guide. Is that a product launch that you see as accelerating new patient adds or more just like sustaining the current growth momentum you have? Wayde McMillan : Yes. So we're not going to guide to Horizon yet. We're planning to have it in the second half of the year. We do not think it will have a material impact on the 2020 revenue. Having said that, we're very excited about this product and the value proposition it brings for the business and our ability to deliver technology to more patients in broader ways because of the advantages of the system. But we're not going to provide any guidance on what that will do to 2021 at this point. Once we launch Horizon then we'll give an update at that time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Margaret Kaczor with William Blair. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. This is actually Brandon in for Margaret. I wanted to kind of focus again on the Type 2 patient population just because you've heard pretty impressive adoption within the market and it's relatively under penetrated rather than focusing on kind of where it can go. Kind of focused on how we got to where we are now. Just interested in -- have you guys been actively kind of marketing into the Type 2 patient population? Or has this been more of Type 2 is coming in to insulate finding out on their own? So it's been kind of more of a push or a pull? And then are your patients -- Type 2 patients are they also 80% plus MDI converts? And I had a follow-up. Thanks. Shacey Petrovic : Great. Bran, good questions. So, I would describe it as a pull strategy really. And it got set up in terms of a strong foundation with Insulet securing Medicare reimbursement, because remember that 40% of people living with Type 2 are over the age of 60. And so Medicare reimbursement is really important in order to be able to drive adoption among this population. And then I think the business model of eliminating the upfront cost and reducing the risk for the patient payor and physician to just try Omnipod for this population of users has helped to encourage more people who otherwise would not have tried it to actually give it a go. And then we're seeing obviously that they like it and are sticking with it. It also reduces the cost burden and makes the cost more predictable for the patient. And so all of those things are really helpful particularly in this patient population. And then I think DASH in particular has some design features that also are very appealing for the Type 2 segment. And so we have educated our sales teams and provided them with tools and resources to help educate clinicians and potential new Omnipod users living with Type 2 diabetes on these benefits. And then obviously launch programs to help them be able to potentially try it before they buy it, so to speak. So all of those things have been helping us drive that increase adoption. Those aren't going away. And I think the growing experience in user base especially among clinicians who are seeing this as a tool that they can wheel, that's successful for these for these patients I think is really helpful and that's why we have confidence that the trend will continue. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. That's helpful. Thanks. And then in the U.S. you have Horizon coming at the end of the year. But interestingly we saw some -- what I saw was pretty good data from Tidepool on their ongoing pivotal study last week. So, I appreciate you won't want to comment on when that might be approved. But I guess the question is one, is there any kind of contemplation of that being approved in your guidance? Is that baked into numbers now? And then two, if once that gets approved, so let's say, theoretically it was approved today, how long would it take for you to be on the market with a Tidepool enabled Omnipod system? Thanks. Wayde McMillan : Sure. So I can start with the guide, if you like. So for products that are not on the market yet, we're not including in our guidance. So that's an easy answer on the Tidepool front. It's really up to them when -- what their time line is and when they launch the product and when it is we'll assess if it has any impact to our guidance or not. Shacey Petrovic : And we've just started to have discussions with Tidepool around what the commercial launch strategy might look like. I think there's a lot of unanswered questions and so I don't want to speak for Tidepool in terms of what their strategy is. I will say that for Horizon and I would highly, highly encourage if not require for Tidepool that a limited market release is something that we will do, because it's really important to ensure that we have fully tested the system. We fully tested our internal support capabilities. We know in particular for Horizon that demand is going to be strong. And so, we want to make sure that we get that right in terms of performance, support training, all of the surround sound of launching a product like that. So, we will go into a limited market release and we'll see a very typical I think execution of that, which means it won't be a kind of a full market release for probably months after the clearance. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Apologies. Anthony for Raj. Just a couple on Horizon. Just wondering, Libre 2.0. What actually is the timing for that on the Abbott side and certainly that's been delayed a bit. So I'm just wondering from the insulin viewpoint, what's the timeline for integrating horizon with Libre 2.0? And then the follow-up would be just on the Horizon clinicals. Maybe just to benchmark the views on time and range we think FDA is looking for? And how that target compares to what was put up in DASH clinical trials? Thanks again. Shacey Petrovic : Sure. So, I'll start with Libre, which we just finalized these agreements. And then once that happens the programs become funded and that's when significant resources start working on them. So those teams will work together then to define the program and then timelines for regulatory submissions and launches. And so we'll communicate that out as we come to alignment and all that guidance is finalized with our partners. I don't -- and wouldn't comment on iCGM clearance for Abbott Libre. We're very confident in our partner. But it's their strategy and their timeline. So our Libre Horizon program is dependent upon in iCGM regulatory clearance. And then the second question was on Horizon time and range. I think we feel very excited about the data that we have published to date. And -- but we're not -- we're blinded to the pivotal clinical data. So we don't have visibility to timing range coming out of our pivotal. We won't have that until the investigators present the data and/or we publish it. So I don't have a lot of insight there. In our discussions with the FDA, they haven't really focused on a particular timing range target. It really has been about how these systems safely and effectively manage glucose delivery -- manage insulin delivery for the patient as opposed to setting out a particular time and range target. And I guess I would validate that by just pointing to the special controls which have now been published for CGM and for -- or for iCGM for iPump and iController, there really aren't time and range targets as part of those special controls. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Taylor with UBS. Your line is open. Matt Taylor : Hi. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, I was hoping you might expand on some of the broader assumptions that would impact your forecast here. So are you assuming for the market that we see similar conversions of patients. We have pretty strong conversions of MDI patients to pump therapy in that forecast? And can you share anything on ASPs or other things that you imputed into the guidance to get to this number? Wayde McMillan : Hey Matt. We're not providing details. We're not going to go into a finery level details on the forecast. What we did share was that, if we achieve the high end of the guidance range that we will be near the growth dollars, excuse me, near the growth dollars that we had in 2019. Obviously if we end up lower in the guidance range it will be lower than 2019. But having said that, I think a lot of the dynamics that we benefited from in 2019 are still in play. Talked about DASH in the pharmacy and the benefits that those bring. But we've also made investments in our commercial teams both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. We continue to gain experience and strengthen on the commercial side of things. So, I think we've got a lot of momentum. We've got a lot of reasons to believe why we can continue to drive a high-teens, low 20s type of a growth rate for this business and that's what we're guiding to for the year. We're not going to get down into further details on that at this time. Matt Taylor : Okay. Maybe just on international, you're going into some new markets. Previously you've talked about these as pretty high-teens growth markets. But your growth rate doesn't assume that you're doing any better than that. Why aren't you getting a lot of revenue out of these new markets that you're going into or you being conservative with the baseline forecast? Wayde McMillan : Yes. So I would argue we're getting a lot out of the markets, actually, Matt. And high-teens, low 20s growth rate is a very strong growth rate. We had to make a significant investments in Europe in particular to build the infrastructure in order to support a business growing high-teens, low 20s and taking over responsibility and establishing ourselves in multiple different countries across Europe. So, we think that we're going at a strong pace at a high-teens, low 20s growth rate. You mentioned the new countries that we're going into and we've talked about five new countries this year. It really speaks to the strength of our business model and the annuity when we don't get a lot of revenue from moving into these five new countries in the beginning, because it takes a period of time to accrue enough customers to get to a material level of revenue. So for us, I think thinking about the annuity model, the durability of the revenue stream once we acquire enough customers. And so in Europe it's a little bit more dispersed, because some of these countries have less people in them than the total available market for us is smaller. When you aggregate it all for Europe it's a very large market. But it takes a period of time for us to get to these markets and bring these people on. So we're actually quite happy with the high-teens, low 20s growth rate. And obviously we're going to continue to make the investments to keep that pace of growth happening in Europe. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Lichtman with Oppenheimer & Co. Your line is open. Steven Lichtman : Thanks. Hi guys. Maybe just a couple of financial questions. Wayde, just to level set on the EBITDA guidance and I apologize if I missed this. Where did you end up 2019 on EBITDA margin? And what non-cash expenses or how much we should be assuming in the 2020 EBITDA guide? Wayde McMillan : Sure. Thanks Steven. Just to clarify, it's adjusted EBITDA. So we finished in low-teens 13% in 2019. And so our guide for this year is a slight improvement over 2019. Steven Lichtman : Okay. Got it. And then just overall guys. How should we be thinking about some core operating expense growth in 2020. And will you be making investment in sales force growth in 2020? Wayde McMillan : Yes. We are making continued investments in sales force growth both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. -- outside the U.S. particularly for the new countries that will be moving into. We're not providing guidance at specific line item levels for operating expenses. But what we've talked about in our strategy several times throughout the year is that number one, you can expect us to continue to invest for growth. And what that means is, we'll be making the majority of our investments in R&D and our innovation pipeline and as well as we talked about commercial which is in selling and marketing and continuing to invest there. We are still investing in G&A because we have to continue to build the support functions in order to support the business when it's growing at the pace that we are. But I think you can assume more leverage off the G&A than off of R&D and selling and marketing. Operator : Thank you. And we do have time for one last question. Our final question comes from Kyle Rose with Canaccord. Your line is open. Kyle Rose : Great. Thank you very much for squeezing me inside. I wondered if we could just take a step back and ask a question just about the broader market, because I think the fact that 80% of your new patients starts are coming from MDI gives you guys a little bit of a different perspective. So I wondered if you could just maybe help us understand how big do you think -- from a penetration perspective do think that Type 1 market is just from a pump standpoint? And then how do you view that from a from a Type 2 perspective? As well as how do you think about your market share within that Type 1 market? Shacey Petrovic : Sure. We don't -- so the best data that we have in terms of pump penetration is from the U.S. and the estimate there is that approximately 35% of people living with Type 1 diabetes are using pump therapy that has been growing. So that's up from 30% just a couple of years ago. And Type 2 is much smaller than that. We estimate at this point probably less than 5% of people living with insulin dependent Type 2 diabetes are relying on pump therapy. We don't really contemplate our percentage of the pump market. We think more about our percentage of the total opportunity because as you note 80% usually 70% to 80%, but more recently 80% of our users come from multiple daily injections. So I don't really have a off the top of my head estimate in terms of market share. Although I would say, we probably have the largest market share in Type 2 just given the way that the growth has occurred. Kyle Rose : Great. And then just one follow up question on some of the dynamics for DASH. I know, initially when you talked about launching DASH, it was using that as a way -- as a lever to open up the pharmacy channel. I mean, obviously that's happened. But when you talk about the penetration or the percentage of patients coming to the pharmacy versus the percentage of patients on DASH, it implies that you're also getting a pretty healthy component of some DME patients there. So I just wondered one, if you could comment on some of the contracting and conversations you're having with payors regarding your DASH in the DME channel. And then just barely on Horizon how you plan on using that as a lever to maybe widen the availability in the pharmacy channel? Shacey Petrovic : Sure. Those are great questions and things we're talking about all the time in terms of Horizon and leveraging the pharmacy channel. And so today, DASH is primarily available in the pharmacy channel. We do have one DME contract through the pharmacy channel, where they have agreed to the pay-as-you-go model. And that's really the distinction. So we actually are open to contracting in DME channels, but what we believe firmly in, and what we believe in 2019 helped grow adoption particularly among the Type 2 segment is what we call our pay-as-you-go model and eliminating this large upfront cost, and in exchange for a premium on the pod. And that should be an attractive value proposition for a payor whether frankly whether you're in the DME side or the pharmacy side, because it helps to offset the risk or absorb the risk for member attrition. And in this one case, large DME payor that is the model that they agreed to, and so we do have a DME contract. So we may or may not see that grow. And frankly, one of the surprises in 2019 was that while we started to see such great progress in pharmacy, and started to see that channel establish itself and grow, we also did not see the consequential decline in the DME channel the way that we might have expected at the beginning of the year. So it's great to see both channels thriving. You know what we believe in, and what we want to see grow across potentially both channels, but particularly well suited in the pharmacy is this pay-as-you-go model. And then the second question that you have regarding pharmacy, the intention regarding Horizon, rather the intention is to leverage all of the work that we've done particularly in the pharmacy with establishing these DASH agreements, establishing the wholesaler partnerships, establishing all of the relationships with our PDMs and our pharmacy payors is to leverage all of that so that we can rapidly establish access for Horizon in the pharmacy, which is our preferred channel to launch the technology in. But I would point out, and we did it pretty quickly with DASH, so we established pretty rapid access in nine months with DASH in 2019. We're hoping to do it faster with Horizon, but it was really rapid adoption in that channel, which I think just points to the strength of the value proposition. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Shacey Petrovic. Shacey Petrovic : Great. Thank you everyone for joining our call today. I want to close by thanking our global Insulet team who works tirelessly to improve the lives of people with diabetes. 2020 is going to be another exciting year for Insulet and we look forward to speaking with all of you throughout the year about our continued progress. Thanks, and have a great evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President of Investor Relations. Deborah Gordon : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us for Insulet's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Joining me are Shacey Petrovic, president and Chief Executive Officer and Wayde McMillan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  The replay of this call will be archived on our website and the press release discussing our first quarter 2020 results and second quarter and full year 2020 guidance is also available in the IR section of our website. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations. We ask that you please refer to the cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely adjusted EBITDA and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth excluding the effect of foreign exchange. We have transitioned to these measures as they align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance and we believe that they are helpful to investors, analysts and other interested parties as a measure of our comparative operating performance from period-to-period. Also, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis and all revenue growth rates will be on a constant currency basis. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Shacey. Shacey Petrovic : Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The last few months have posed extraordinary challenges for countries and communities around the world as we've grappled with the impact of COVID-19. Our hearts go out to those whose health has been affected and our gratitude goes out to the many medical professionals and first responders on the front-lines. We also hope that all of you joining us on today's call are staying safe and healthy. As a company committed to improving the lives of people with diabetes, the safety and well-being of our Insulet employees and the communities and Podders we serve, have been our top priorities as we navigate these difficult circumstances. In March, we transitioned to remote work arrangements for the vast majority of employees, in line with guidance issued by the WHO, CDC, local governments and health authorities. For those employees performing critical on-site functions, we significantly enhanced safety procedures to include social distancing, PPE protocols, frequent deep cleaning of our facilities and temperature monitoring. I am pleased to report that this transition has been essentially seamless and on behalf of our leadership team, I'd like to express our sincere gratitude to the employees who are continuing to work on-site to ensure we can provide uninterrupted supply of Omnipod to our customers. I am incredibly proud of our global teams\u2019 resilience and compassion in the face of this challenge. While balancing many other demands like working from home, caring for children and keeping their families and friends healthy, our dedicated employees have never lost focus on our mission. Our Insulet team is what makes us such a great company and I want to thank each and every one of our employees across the globe.  I'd also like to thank our many supply chain partners for supporting our ability to build excess capacity and redundancy to ensure we can serve our customers without interruption and without delay. Notwithstanding the difficult external environment that began to affect our international business in February and U.S. market in March, we achieved first quarter revenue of almost $200 million, representing a 25% increase, driven by 34% revenue growth in our total diabetes product line. This performance is a testament to both our execution and the strength of our recurring revenue business model. We were well positioned coming into the crisis having ended 2019 in a position of strength with healthy inventory levels, a strong balance sheet, robust global manufacturing operations and plans to capitalize on our growth prospects. We started 2020 with global Omnipod revenue near all-time highs and in the first quarter, we made continued progress on our strategic imperatives. In the face of new obstacles, we\u2019ve responded quickly and effectively, maintaining our focus on execution and we delivered financial results exceeding our expectations. While the impacts of COVID are difficult to predict, after a careful consideration and scenario planning, we have decided to maintain our annual guidance, although, we expect to come in at the low-end of the range we previously provided. Our unique business model is a key differentiator, since we generate the vast majority of our revenue from our large existing customer base.  Therefore, while the current environment is unusually challenging, we believe our 2019 and Q1 2020 momentum will provide insulation. This gives us confidence that even in the face of this [Indiscernible] revenue at the mid-teens rate in 2020.  Wayde will provide more detail. But assuming market dynamics normalize early next year, we also believe we can maintain our $1 billion revenue goal for 2021. Importantly, our relative strength in the near-term allows us to continue to invest in our strategic imperatives that will drive growth over the longer-term. These investments will ensure that over the coming years, Insulet makes significant strides to improve the lives of people with diabetes. We will bring the simplest, most consumer-friendly technology to market.  Our business model innovation will ensure cost-effective access to the broadest population of users across the globe and our investment in operational excellence will ensure supply chain resiliency, world-class manufacturing capabilities, and industry-leading gross margins. There is much work to be done to realize our vision and in 2020, we will continue to make significant progress. This year, we are focused on driving four key initiatives forward. One, deliver consumer-focused innovation; two, ensure the best global customer experience; three, expand our global footprint; and four, drive operational excellence across the organization.  Our team has done a remarkable job quickly adjusting in the face of COVID-19 and despite the challenges of working remotely, we do not expect an impact of more than a couple of quarters on our execution timelines. Engineers are finding creative ways to innovate in their newly virtual teams, sales calls are happening via Webex and our manufacturing and supply teams are ensuring we meet our growing customer demand without missing a beat. I'll now walk through our Q1 progress on each of these key initiatives, starting with delivering a consumer-focused innovation. During the first quarter, we continued to grow the number of Omnipod DASH users, driven by both the intuitive simplicity of its platform and our unique pay-as-you-go business model through the pharmacy channel.  By eliminating complexity and restrictions, we are making Omnipod more accessible to a broader range of customers. Omnipod is differentiated, particularly in a down economy because it has no upfront cost.  This is also helpful to Insulet, creating a high degree of insulation through our recurring revenue durable annuity model. In this first quarter, we continued to increase coverage for Omnipod DASH, which helped grow the number of customers accessing Omnipod DASH through the pharmacy. As of the end of Q1, we had secured Omnipod coverage in the United States for over 50% of Medicare and approximately 70% of Medicaid beneficiaries. And we've seen a notable tick-up in commercial coverage for DASH, with DASH now covered for over 60% of commercially insured lives.  In the first quarter, approximately one-third of our U.S. new Omnipod starts were Type 2, primarily Omnipod DASH through the pharmacy channel. As a result of this strong growth and expanding market access, our U.S. new Omnipod starts represented another record Q1. With last year's launch of Omnipod DASH, we created our online training program for DASH customers transitioning from Omnipod. This enables users to get started via online training without the need to leave home or meet with a clinician for support. Thanks to DASH's simplicity. This web-based training has been a success and today, it is being used extensively to support thousands of users. And in fact, many users transitioning from Omnipod to DASH just rely on the intuitive user interface, which provides step-by-step instructions to get started. These tools were created to support effective scaling of our business and have proven to be exceptionally helpful in our current environment. In addition, in response to the pandemic, our team worked quickly to expand and enhance our program to include virtual training for new users that still want support from a clinician. The virtual training and support capabilities we have built across our global business have allowed us to successfully service existing customers and to onboard new customers, even those that are brand-new to pump therapy. In fact, over the last several weeks in our direct markets, which represent about half of our business, we have on-boarded approximately 2,000 new users via virtual training with Insulet clinical trainers. And about 80% of these were MDI users new to pump and pod therapy. We have also seen our distributors and intermediaries implement great virtual training programs.  Last week, I personally observed one of these trainings via Webex and it was a remarkable experience. Our Clinical Training Manager walked a Podder, 7-year-old Colton and his parents through the setup and pod activation of Omnipod DASH. They were transitioning from multiple daily injections. The training was thorough, effective, and the family was clearly at ease receiving it in the comfort of their own home and it was absolutely wonderful to see the delight on Colton's and his mom's faces when they learned about DASH's food library and temp basal capabilities, and when they experienced putting on their very first pod. It was a clear reminder of just how simple and accessible Omnipod is. We have made great strides in delivering a best-in-class customer experience. We are constantly making it easier for users to try Omnipod and access it from a convenient pharmacy. We had much of this work underway in order to support our rapid growth and our goal to deliver the best global customer experience. Telemedicine, virtual training tools and the convenience of pharmacy access will continue to deliver appealing, scalable customer experiences.  While we remain encouraged by the momentum of Omnipod DASH, we have seen a slowdown of new Omnipod starts globally. This intensified in March, as many people delayed non emergency doctor visits due to COVID-19 and we expect to face the strongest new start headwinds in the second quarter.  It is obviously difficult to predict the timing and extent to which COVID will impact our business. We don't know how long our customers will be challenged meeting with their physicians or precisely how much our telehealth capabilities will offset this impact. Our guidance assumes the pandemic's recessionary headwinds will persist throughout 2020, followed by a gradual recovery starting in the third quarter, as economies begin to reopen and physician and patient interactions begin to normalize. We are presently assuming market dynamics return to normal starting in 2021. In addition to ensuring the safety of our employees and continuity of supply to our Podders, our team has found ways to give back to our communities. We have participated in PPE donation programs to local healthcare facilities and gifted computer equipment to support remote schooling needs in our communities.  And I am particularly proud that in response to the significant economic impact of COVID-19, we have broadened our financial assistance program to ensure those who rely on Omnipod can remain on product if they lose insurance coverage. This is a robust program designed to help address the unique healthcare affordability challenges for U.S. Omnipod users, who lose coverage due to COVID-19 and are not covered by Medicare or Medicaid. For these users, we will provide up to six months of pods at zero cost through the end of 2020. Throughout the first quarter, we continued our work to develop our next-generation product, Omnipod powered by Horizon. We remain highly confident that Omnipod Horizon, the first tubeless, personal, smartphone-controlled automated insulin delivery system will be a game changer for people living with diabetes. As you know, we paused the Horizon trial at the beginning of March in order to address a software anomaly. I am pleased to report that we have successfully completed the software update and has been sent to the FDA for review. Given anticipated agency review times and newly required logistics at our trial sites, we are now tracking to bring Omnipod Horizon to the U.S. market in the first half of 2021.  We are fortunate to benefit from the enthusiastic support of our trial sites and participants and expect that all sites and virtually all patients will continue in the trial. That said, COVID-19 presents some challenges to how we support and monitor the trial and this likely will add a few months to our timelines. The team has reacted quickly, proposing updated protocols to the FDA to ensure virtual follow-up and support and our interactions with the agency continue to be collaborative and helpful.  We look forward to resuming the trial and we know our study participants are eagerly awaiting the benefits of simple, automated insulin delivery provided by Omnipod Horizon. In addition to our progress with Omnipod Horizon, the team has continued to advance our collaborations with Dexcom, Abbott and Tidepool. Over the coming years, these partnerships will bring exciting new products to market that will deliver reduced burden and improved outcomes for people living with insulin-dependent diabetes. We also continued to advance our existing platforms to bring even more value to our customers. This year, we will build-out Omnipod DASH with various new languages to further expand globally and we will deliver DASH with remote upgrade capabilities, including secure cloud-to-cloud integration through Glooko, enabling additional ease of use and telemedicine capabilities. And development work is underway on mobile phone platform extensions for Omnipod Horizon such as iOS. Now, turning to our global expansion. As a result of the progress we made capitalizing on our direct operations in Europe, we have strengthened our presence in many of our large underserved existing markets. We entered into a limited commercial release of Omnipod DASH in three European markets at the end of 2019 and had planned to further roll out DASH in Europe and Canada and to enter five new international markets.  We are eager to expand into new geographies and DASH has been well received in the markets in which we've launched it. COVID-19, however, presents some uncertainty in terms of market readiness, training and preparedness of our teams and partners, as well as regulatory and market clearances.  We believe these dynamics delay our DASH and market expansion efforts into early 2021, as we work to ensure the markets are prepared for successful DASH launches and market expansions. These impacts are temporary and we continue to view global expansion as an exciting multiyear growth driver for Insulet. Lastly, I will address our manufacturing innovation and ongoing efforts to drive global operational excellence. Several years ago, we began taking steps to strengthen our global supply chain. We focused on building redundancy with our U.S. manufacturing capabilities to supplement our capacity in China, as well as create redundancy throughout our entire global supply chain.  The importance of this effort was highlighted as we worked to maintain production continuity in the face of COVID-19, first in China, and then in the United States. I am very proud of the incredible work our team has done to ensure we are producing above planned product levels, while ensuring the safety and well-being of our global employees. We are laser-focused on making sure our customers receive continued uninterrupted access to Omnipod. This pandemic is the challenge of our lifetimes, but we will emerge stronger and better for it. Already at Insulet, it is driving us to improve systems, enhance telemedicine capabilities and further strengthen our manufacturing operations and supply chain. Insulet is rising to this incredible challenge and there is no other team I would rather work with and rely on to see us through to the other side. We remain focused on executing our strategy to continue creating value for shareholders. And we remain focused on our mission to improve the lives of people living with diabetes even in the most difficult of times. I'll now turn the call over to Wayde. Wayde McMillan : Thank you, Shacey. These are challenging times as we deal with the ongoing global health crisis, and I'd like to also say, thank you to the Insulet team, who has shown incredible adaptability, as we have all adjusted to a new mode of operating. And well wishes to all of those impacted by COVID-19.  We are certainly not immune to the headwinds created by the pandemic. However, as Shacey stated, we are fortunate to have a durable annuity model with the vast majority of revenue generated in any given quarter coming from our existing customer base.  The current global environment is disrupted, but it does not change the significant market opportunity we have and we remain well positioned for sustainable growth over the long-term. We are confident in our ability to continue creating significant value for our shareholders while advancing our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes. We achieved another strong quarter of financial and operating performance in Q1. The execution of our strategic imperatives is paying off and we continue to invest for growth. As a reminder, the revenue growth rates I will discuss on this call are on a constant currency basis.  In the first quarter of 2020, we delivered revenue growth of 25.3%, approximately $7 million above our quarterly guidance range. This strong growth was driven by our global diabetes business, which grew 34% and was $10.5 million above our guidance range. We were able to achieve these results as our global operations and commercial teams did a tremendous job quickly adjusting to the constraints caused by COVID-19.  The operations team put measures in place early in the quarter, as we learned of challenges ramping back up our China manufacturing facility in January and the commercial team acted quickly later in March as regional lockdowns were implemented to switch to more telehealth activity.  As a result, we've been able to deliver product to customers without interruption and we are producing above historic levels with volume contribution from our new U.S. manufacturing plant, all while keeping a keen focus on ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and delivering products to our customers. By product line, U.S. Omnipod revenue grew 35.4%, $5.6 million above our guidance range and represented the highest growth rate we have achieved in our first quarter in over five years.  Our increasing customer base and growing adoption of Omnipod DASH, primarily through the pharmacy channel, continue to be the main drivers of outperformance, along with a mix benefit for the premium on Omnipod DASH.  In the quarter, we experienced an easing of the seasonal impact of Q1 deductible resets given our shift to the pharmacy and we also benefited from an estimated $4 million of end-customer stocking due to COVID-19. As a reminder, we began generating revenue for DASH at the start of the second quarter of last year. So our 2020 first half growth rate will benefit from annualizing the first full year of Omnipod DASH and our move into the pharmacy. In the first quarter, volume growth of Omnipod DASH drove over 60% of our U.S. new Omnipod starts and we grew U.S. volume through the pharmacy channel to almost 30% of our total.  International Omnipod revenue grew 31.9%, $5 million above our guidance range. International also benefited from an estimated $2 million of channel stocking orders due to COVID-19 late in the quarter. Drug Delivery revenue declined 50% and was below our guidance range. This was due to a shift in timing of production, which you will see is reflected in the greater-than-normal revenue growth we expect from this product line in the second quarter.  Overall, we are pleased with our strong revenue growth in the first quarter and start to the year, despite beginning to see a slowdown in new Omnipod customers in March. Turning to gross margin, we delivered 64.1% in the quarter, down 280 basis points year-over-year and flat sequentially, including a 160 basis point unfavorable impact from COVID-19-related costs, as well as a 40 basis point unfavorable impact from FX.  Also impacting gross margin was the continued impact of ramping production at our new U.S. manufacturing facility, with our second manufacturing line starting production in early March.  Partially offsetting the gross margin headwinds were the continued improvements through our global manufacturing and supply chain operations. We were well prepared for this difficult situation given our complete supply chain redundancy strategies implemented over the last several years. The incremental 2020 costs we are incurring to maintain the safety of employees and the quality of our products and to ensure we produce ahead of demand is critically important during this time. We are pleased to be producing sellable product on our second U.S. manufacturing line and as we've previously communicated, it means we will incur a headwind to gross margin as we ramp. With the recent shift in focus to COVID-19 safety and mitigation efforts, we are now assuming a slower ramp of our manufacturing lines. Once fully operational, our U.S. manufacturing facility and lower landed cost of goods will drive gross margin expansion over the long-term.  Operating expenses in the first quarter were 60% of revenue, compared to 62% in the prior year, in line with our expectations and we ended the quarter with adjusted EBITDA of 12.3%. Regarding our cash and liquidity status, we are in a favorable cash position with no debt maturing until 2024 at the earliest and very low cash interest expense. At the end of the first quarter, we had $382 million in cash and investments, compared to $435 million at the end of last year.  This sequential decrease was primarily driven by our use of cash in order to invest for growth, including planned capital expenditures for our U.S. manufacturing and supply chain operations. As a result of the recent refinancing of our convertible debt, we have a favorable debt profile with no near-term maturities and no restrictive covenants. In summary, we have the cash position and favorable financing structure we need to profitably grow our business. Turning to our 2020 guidance. We are in an unprecedented time with the dynamic COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertainties it is creating. As we communicated in our earnings release, and as Shacey stated, we are maintaining our revenue guidance at the low end of our original total company range.  We have the benefit of the durability of our recurring revenue model, which provides the vast majority of our revenue from our existing customer base. Historically, new Omnipod starts within any given quarter contributed approximately 10% of revenue. It is difficult to accurately predict the progression of COVID-19 and the extent of the resulting depth or length of the disruption.  However, we want to provide you with the key metrics for our business and underlying assumptions as we track them during this time. We have developed a set of assumptions, based on what we have experienced through April and what we understand about the macro environment. If our base assumptions are either too high or too low, we are well prepared to manage through the multiple scenarios. As noted, we are assuming that the most significant impact will be on new global Omnipod starts in the second quarter with gradual recovery throughout the second half of the year, assuming economies around the globe begin to reopen. As a result of a reduction in new Omnipod starts in Q2 and an assumed continued headwind in the second half of the year, we expect a compounding effect on revenue growth to mostly impact the second half of the year.  As compared to our previous expectations at the start of the year, we are now assuming quarterly reductions in our global new Omnipod starts of approximately 50% to 75% in the second quarter, approximately 50% in the third quarter and approximately 25% in the fourth quarter.  We are also assuming some downward pressure on utilization and an uptick in attrition to account for expected recessionary headwinds. Given our no-charge PDMs and pay-as-you-go model in the pharmacy, we feel we are well positioned in the \u2013 if the market becomes more cost-sensitive. This allows patients to adopt pod therapy for their diabetes management without the large upfront cost or the challenge of a four year lock-in period. We have also established a set of leading indicators and are monitoring our data more frequently to adjust to different scenarios as they play out in this challenging time. For our total company 2020 revenue guidance, we now expect approximately 15% growth, which is at the low end of the range we've previously provided. By product-line, we have slightly adjusted guidance. We now expect total Omnipod revenue growth of approximately 18%, at the low end of our prior guide. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect revenue growth of approximately 19%, near the low end of our prior guidance and for international Omnipod, we expect revenue growth of approximately 16%, which is below our prior guidance.  Lastly, for Drug Delivery, we expect to land in the middle of the range we previously provided of a 15% to 20% decline based on our partners' current forecasts. Now turning to the rest of the P&L on a full year basis, for gross margin, we now expect the full year to be approximately 63%, compared to our prior expectation of approximately 65%. This factors in our forecasted reduction in volumes and related lower revenue forecast due to COVID-19, as well as an estimated $5 million to $10 million of additional one-time costs related to COVID-19 safety and mitigation efforts. Also factored into our gross margin estimate is a slower ramp in our new U.S. manufacturing lines, as timing has been impacted by the shift in focus for the operations team to mitigate the risks related to pandemic safety, as well as supply chain continuity. And, to a lesser extent, the assumed cost of our enhanced financial assistance program. Our 2020 and long-term financial strategy and capital deployment plan remain unchanged and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be consistent with prior year. We will continue to invest in our innovation pipeline, expand our global commercial initiatives and invest in U.S. manufacturing. Lastly, we are reaffirming our expectation of adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue in the mid-teens, now closer to the low end of the range. For 2021, as Shacey stated earlier, if our base assumptions hold for 2020 and we see market conditions stabilize in 2021, we will remain on track to deliver our revenue target of $1 billion.  For our 2021 gross margin target, as a result of the pandemic impact to volume and U.S. manufacturing ramp, we now expect a range of 67% to 70%. We still see a pathway to our original 70% target.  However, there are many scenarios that can play out. So we feel it's prudent to provide a wider range at this time. In no way does it change our confidence that we will achieve 70% gross margin over time.  Finally, we are reaffirming our expectation of 2021 operating income as a percentage of revenue in the mid-teens, now closer to the low-end of the range. In summary, we started the year with higher-than-expected performance in Q1 and with our resilient business fundamentals and base assumptions, we believe Insulet is well positioned to sustain growth in 2020 and over the long-term. We remain focused on our strategic imperatives in delivering on our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes around the globe. In closing, our thoughts and prayers go out to everyone impacted at this time. We are proud of our Insulet employees that have responded to this challenging situation and how they remain focused on our mission. With that, we'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Robbie Marcus of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Robert Marcus : Great. Thanks for taking the question. And congrats on a really nice quarter. We've \u2013 in our checks with endocrinologists, we consistently hear that, pumps are a little harder to train remotely than CGM, but Omnipod stands out as being easier than other competitive pumps to train remotely, plus the cost to access and the cost to use is significantly lower, which bodes well during what should be a pretty tough economic time the next few months or longer here.  So how are you thinking in terms \u2013 I know most of your new patient starts come from MDI. But how are you thinking about your competitive positioning here going forward, both to patients to basically pay up before a pump, but also versus your competitors, where you might have a lot of benefits versus them? Thanks. Shacey Petrovic : Thanks, Robbie. Yes, I think you are right. Your data supports what we see, which is that we are \u2013 there are all sorts of things that make Omnipod a really appealing insulin delivery therapy for patients. And some of those things are even more powerful in an environment like the one we are in.  When you think about the move towards a more cost-conscious consumer in this really challenging economic environment, obviously, the fact that you don't have to pay upfront for Omnipod and you are not locked in to four years of therapy, those things are very appealing. But I think probably even more powerful than that is the simplicity of the platform. And in some ways, telehealth just plays really perfectly into our strategy, because our whole goal is to bring the simplest, most consumer-friendly technology to market and if you think about what you need to be able to transition people in a telehealth environment, from multiple daily injections to a new technology, it's got to be simple.  And we've developed a technology that is simple enough for kids, simple enough for multiple daily injection users and one that really, if you think about it, has two components, no needles to handle, no infusion sets. So it's just a very simple technology to train on. And I think that differentiator is going to become more powerful in the environment that we are in today.  So, we feel good about this trend and I personally am really excited by the capabilities that we've built and expanded on in a really short period of time to be able to lean in during this time and really bring our technology to more people who need it. Robert Marcus : Great. Maybe just as a quick follow-up, Insulet stands out as having a lot of China manufacturing exposure. You touched on this a bit in the prepared remarks and you have done a great job ramping up with the new manufacturing facility. I believe, line one is up. Line two is on its way and line three is being built. But how should we think about when you'll have much more dependence on the U.S. manufacturing versus outside the U.S. in case this lasts for much longer? Wayde McMillan : Hi, Robbie, it's Wayde. I can take that one. And the team saw this risk several years ago when they laid out the multi-year strategy and obviously made a significant investment. I know you've seen it here as well.  And to your point, that's giving a lot of tailwinds to the team here during this current challenge that we've got two lines up and running now and producing and that's allowing us to actually build inventory through this time and so being able to stay ahead of demand and demand that's overachieving or outperforming our base scenarios. Regarding the risk in China, I mean, we've got a really strong partner in China. I think we are very impressed by how quickly they took on the challenge and we are able to staff, recruit, onboard, train and safely move people into the facility and get our production up. It was clearly delayed from a typical year-end start. But, given the environment, we were impressed by how quickly both the third-party team and our operations teams work together. I highlighted here some of the costs. We've put some incentives in place to help fund some of the work that our third-party manufacturer was doing and some of the extent they were going to get employees into the facility to get producing for us again after the New Year.  So, I think we're going to see a multi-facility strategy from us going forward. And one of the main drivers for our U.S. manufacturing facility was to get redundancy and we'll have redundancy once we have three and four lines running here in the U.S. and keeping our China manufacturing facilities. So we'll achieve that objective once we get our third line up and then eventually onto our fourth line. Next question, please? Operator : Yes. Our next question coming from the line of David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. David Lewis : Good afternoon. A couple of quick ones for me. Wayde, I appreciate all the great detail on new patient start impacts across the quarter. I wonder, just given that certain geographies are beginning to open up, certain regions in the U.S. are beginning to open up and we are seeing this growing impact to telemedicine here in April as it leads into May.  That quantification that you gave us across the quarters, that\u2019s sinking up as sort of the qualitative recovery you are seeing April into May? Or is it sort of slightly ahead or slightly behind? Wayde McMillan : So, good afternoon, Dave. Yes, so \u2013 and thanks for bringing this one up, because we are hoping that we'd get an opportunity to give a little bit more context on it. Starting with the matching of our assumptions with the global economy and what we are starting to see in the macro environment with different countries and regions opening up. That's why we tied our base assumptions to this gradual improvement through the end of the year. And clearly, we are expecting headwinds through the rest of the year. If it happens that regions open quicker and our customers and patients can get to meet with their physicians and get the therapies that they need to treat their disease sooner. We'll be ahead of those assumptions. But at this point, we're assuming that we'll continue to see these headwinds through the end of the year. And to the second part of your question, how does that compare or contrast to what we've seen in April? I'll use this as an opportunity just to help explain to people the impact of our model and it really shows the durability of our model, because the impact to Q2 is not really impacted that much by new patient starts. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, approximately 10% of any quarter is due to new patient starts. And so, we're really benefiting from the strong second half of 2019 and strong performance into Q1. And what we've seen so far in April is, revenue continuing to perform well because we're benefiting from that momentum coming into Q2.  But behind that, we are seeing a slowdown in our new patient starts. And we really see that in two stages. We track our sales cycle in two main stages, sales leads and then actual new patient starts. So even in front of new patient starts, we are tracking our sales leads and that's where we saw a pretty acute drop-off in March.  And so, as that funnel coming into Q2 starts to get smaller, that's where we are seeing the impact and so that's going to impact May and June for the most part. So we are anticipating our new patient starts, although strong through April, will start to slow down here through May and June.  And then, it's our expectation that both given the ability for people to return to their endocrinologists and work on different strategies to improve their therapy, including pod therapy, we are assuming we'll gradually improve through the end of the year. And then, as Shacey highlighted, telehealth, we feel we are very well positioned.  Our teams were already working on telehealth initiatives, and we were training people virtually. But we have redoubled those efforts now in the face of this pandemic and we are doing, as Shacey said, thousands more and that's growing every day. David Lewis : Okay. Wayde. Thanks. That's super helpful. And then maybe, Shacey, just one quick one for you, kind of also tied to recovery. But in the ex U.S. impacts, your forecasting is a little heavier than U.S., which makes sense given the different sites of service or how this healthcare is delivered in those two geographies. But how would you characterize the visibility into the U.S. recovery relative to the ex U.S. recovery? Thanks so much and great job. Shacey Petrovic : Thanks, David. Yes, you are right, on ex U.S., just the way that care is delivered there, obviously, many more people living with diabetes get trained on new technologies like Omnipod in the hospital setting, as opposed to the clinic setting. And so, we do anticipate it'll take a little bit longer for some of those markets to return towards normalcy and the headwinds are a little bit more significant. That said, we do have telehealth activities going on and virtual trainings going on in every international market, just like we do in every U.S. territory. And so, I think that's just the nature of what we are dealing with in the U.S. In terms of visibility, we have \u2013 we benefit in the U.S. from visibility to our direct customers and that helps give us a sense of what we can extrapolate across the markets. The same thing is true in Europe, although I think the insights into our direct patients aren't as easily extrapolated into additional markets.  So that's the challenge we have, is just how fragmented the European market is. But we work every day obviously with our partners and with our team to get those insights and as Wayde said, to be tracking those leading indicators, so that we can manage the business as effectively as we can during this time. Next question? Operator : And our next question coming from the line of Joanne Wuensch with Citi. Joanne Wuensch : Good afternoon everybody and thank you for taking the question. One of the things that I am trying to get my head around is the patient or the new patient adds that aren't happening right now. When do they come back? And how do they come back? Shacey Petrovic : Yes. I think it's a good question, Joanne. It's difficult obviously to predict the future. What our data shows is, and I'll speak mainly to the U.S., because that's where we have really the best insight. But what our data demonstrates is that, in the United States, endocrinologist visits are down 60% since the beginning of March.  And of that remaining 40% that are still happening, 15% of those are being delivered via telemedicine. So a pretty significant drop-off. What we see is just a more and more adoption of telemedicine across the United States. So I think that'll help offset it. And I think one of our questions is, how durable is telemedicine, because it's obviously dependent in some ways on reimbursement.  But we do track state-by-state new patient starts and as Wayde said, our leads in those markets to see in some of these areas that were hit harder than others, are they starting to recuperate? And so we see indications of that across various markets and that's what we'll continue to track so that we can continue to forecast. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you. And then my second question has to do with the international market, recognizing maybe it will be slower to open up new geographies. How do you think about approaching them? And does what's happening globally changed your view on what markets may be next or not? Thank you very much for taking the questions. Shacey Petrovic : Thanks, Joanne. I don't think this impact today makes us feel differently about the new markets that we had planned to enter. Really, what's \u2013 what we are planning for is just to make sure that we have all of these markets prepared for successful launches. And so, in various markets, we might be, for example partnering with a strong distributor partner there. We may be seeking market clearances or even regulatory approvals and we want to make sure that all of that stuff is in place before we launch into the market. And so that's really where we are \u2013 when we're thinking about different timelines and potentially early 2021 instead of 2020, it's really tied to making sure that we have everything prepared so that we can have successful launches.  Not that we are thinking about different territories at this point. There is a tremendous amount of opportunity, as I always say. We are really in a handful of countries relative to the rest of the world, and that's true even in Europe where we are starting to build a really strong presence there. There is still a tremendous amount of unmet need.  So we are going to attack that unmet need. It's just going to be a little bit later than we expected because of these dynamics. Operator : And our next question coming from the line of Margaret Kaczor with William Blair. Your line is open. Malgorzata Kaczor : Hey, good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the questions. First one for me, I guess, on the virtual training, I wanted to follow-up on that. I understand 15% of the 40% of patients or remaining were trained virtually. But as you look at that going forward, can you give us the advantages and disadvantages of that? For example, is it easier to get to a patient online or are there cheaper costs associated with that? Shacey Petrovic : Sure. Yes. I think we're seeing a lot of advantages, frankly and not any disadvantages in terms of virtual training. I mean, I think there are always going to be some subset of patients who would prefer in a perfect world to be trained with a clinician or in a clinic.  But the feedback from patients on virtual training has been incredibly positive. People are describing it as simple. I can tell you from the one that I witnessed just on Friday that the patients were incredibly comfortable. The family was incredibly comfortable that we were able to get more insight into kind of how they operate by just seeing them at home.  And it was a very efficient, very effective training, so. and the feedback has been very positive. So I think this is a trend that will continue regardless of what happens with telemedicine. We are seeing a lot of positive feedback out of this. Our clinicians can be more efficient. Patients don't have to get into the clinic and the feedback has been very positive.  It's just so simple. You don't have a needle. You don't have \u2013 you have two components, and it's a really straightforward technology to walk a user through. So, it is ideally suited to virtual training. Malgorzata Kaczor : Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And then in terms of the patient leads and sales and marketing strategies in the interim, I've seen most of your patients at this point are coming from face-to-face visits with ENDOs and strategic discussions with ENDOs and so on.  But, are you going to change any of that strategy over the summer or kind of through year-end to maybe get patients through different channels like an online channel? Thanks. Shacey Petrovic : Yes. Thanks, Margaret. I \u2013 first, I'll say that it's pretty remarkable to me that actually virtual sales calls are still happening with endocrinology offices and in many cases, ENDOs are really looking for information from us in terms of how we can support telehealth activities. I think earlier in February, we had a webinar focused on telemedicine with Omnipod and like 800 physicians attended that.  So there is a tremendous demand out there for this information and insight to how do you do this well, and we've got great resources to be able to support those discussions with ENDOs. So that isn't going away. But to your point, obviously, that's where the headwinds are coming from.  We have reallocated resources from a sales and marketing perspective, from things like conferences and travel and entertainment to a more digital outreach, direct-to-patients, to be able to engage them on : one, the benefits of Omnipod, and two, the fact that you can try it, risk-free and you can train all at home without needing to go into the clinic. And so it's early days, but we believe that message will resonate with patients. Operator : And our next question coming from the line of Ryan Blicker of Cowen. Your line is open. Ryan Blicker : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Can you talk a little bit more about what to assume within your revised Horizon timelines? When are you assuming the trial restarts? And then, do you still expect to conduct a limited market release prior to a full launch in the U.S.? Or do you believe you could broadly launch Horizon in the U.S. upon FDA approval? Shacey Petrovic : Thanks, Ryan. So we are anticipating just a little bit of time, a few weeks of FDA review for the submission to restart the trial. And then, we've got to retrain sites, et cetera on just the virtual protocols for follow-up and monitoring of patients. And so, we think that's going to take a little bit of time, probably sometime into June, I would guess, before we restart the trial. And in terms of a limited market release, we will do a limited market release. It's best practice with any new technology to do a limited market release. We will do what we can to bring this technology as rapidly and through access and other methods to patients as quickly as possible because, we know there is a significant demand out there. But it is going to take us a little bit of time to get through the limited market release. Ryan Blicker : Got it. Very helpful. And then I apologize if I missed this. But what proportion of the new patient starts in the U.S. were through the pharmacy in the quarter? And what proportion of your overall U.S. installed base is now going through the pharmacy? And do you believe the transition to the pharmacy could be accelerated at all in the U.S. due to COVID-19? Thank you. Shacey Petrovic : I'll take maybe the pharmacy issues and then Wayde can talk about what percentage of our new starts. I am not sure if we gave that detail. But in terms of the overall base, we now have almost 30% of our U.S. customers going through the pharmacy.  And actually, when I think about how do we really scale this business, we've always been thinking about how do we help our customers get the best customer experience through self-service, through easier training, et cetera. And we've talked a lot about that. Our virtual training tools and our web-based training tools.  But the pharmacy is a big piece of this, too. This work was underway for us, because diabetes is an epidemic and endocrinology is in short supply. And so we need to innovate the business model to be able to ensure that we can meet this rapidly growing demand in this unmet need. And so, of course, all of the telemedicine stuff that we talked about is a piece of that.  But the other piece of that, if patients need care and potentially aren't in their physicians' offices frequently, the pharmacy could play a really exciting and really important role, because unlike your endocrinology office, there is a pharmacy on every corner and if we could leverage that channel to educate, inform, and support patients, that could be a much better customer experience.  And of course, it's a channel that we, right now, from an insulin delivery standpoint or insulin pump standpoint, own. And so, very \u2013 we see it as a worthy investment in a way to provide the best possible experience and the most cost-effective scaling commercially of our business. Wayde McMillan : Hey, Ryan, it's Wayde. And just to add on there to round off your question. As Shacey said, our installed base in the pharmacy is at 30%. We didn't give exact pharmacy new patient starts. But DASH, we did and DASH is 60% of our new patient starts, almost all of those were through the pharmacy as well as type 2 has grown to be a third of our new patient starts and the majority of those are through the pharmacy as well.  So, DASH and type 2 are a big part of what's driving the volume growth now to the 30% going through the pharmacy. Shacey Petrovic : It's great to see, too, just the progress we've made on establishing access through the pharmacy. It's a big piece of why we've been able to expand so much and in fact, just in the last month, we've even secured Cigna coverage in the pharmacy channel, which is \u2013 that's part of why we saw that tick-up in commercial coverage and part of what continues to drive adoption through the pharmacy channel. Operator : And our next question coming from the line of Jeff Johnson of Baird. Your line is open. Jeffrey Johnson : Thank you. Good afternoon. Hey, Shacey, I wanted to follow-up maybe on the questions around new patient starts and the 50% to 75% decline in the second quarter and then the gating thereafter. Trying to triangulate that with your comments about the ease of use of prescribing through telehealth and that.  Do you think that 50% to 75% and then the third and fourth quarter numbers that you are giving, how do you feel like that compares maybe to the broader insulin pump market at this point? Are you guys doing better than? About the same as or worse than? Just given your comments on the ease of prescribing, I would think better than.  But just would love any kind of competitive intelligence you are hearing out in the field from your docs on what those numbers represent relative to market. Shacey Petrovic : Yes. Sure, Jeff. I think I don't want to comment on kind of competitive pump businesses. But what we do know, just from IQVIA data and market \u2013 primary market research is that in the United States, ENDO visits are down 60% since the beginning of March. So I think that gives you a sense that this 50% to 75% number is probably right in line with what others are seeing. And while we are, I would say, bullish on what kind of fit Omnipod is for telemedicine and we believe in that world we can lean in and do better than others. At the same time, we are relying on ENDOs to build telemedicine capabilities. So while we have kind of sped ahead and I think built some really exciting capabilities and support mechanisms for our ENDO offices, they are still across the globe.  Different clinics are in very different situations in terms of their capabilities to be able to support telemedicine. So, we're a little bit ahead of the curve, and we'll see how this plays out and how quickly ENDO offices across the globe, frankly, but particularly in the United States can start to implement and support telehealth for their patients. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Jayson Bedford of Raymond James. Your line is open. Matt Wizman : This is Matt Wizman on for Jayson. I appreciate all the color and visibility you guys have been giving. It's much appreciated. My question is on the type 2s. So now that there is been a bit more time with kind of a more substantial amount of type 2s in the base, have you noticed any change in the utilization or attrition dynamics with these types of users?  And then also, could you speak to the broader type 2 reimbursement environment on the commercial front, especially given how \u2013 on the CGM front, some payers have been a bit more friendly? Thanks. Wayde McMillan : Great. Hey, Matt. I can \u2013 this is Wayde. I can answer the first part of the question and then hand it to Shacey for the second part. So, we have not seen a material change as type 2s have become a bigger part of our mix of products. Our utilization has stayed pretty steady through Q1 and also through the first month of April.  And in fact, one of the things that was on our radar when we set our annual guidance at the beginning of the year and one of the things that we thought could have pushed us to the lower end of our original guide was attrition, because, we had done a lot of new things, a new channel, a new product, a new business model with the pay-as-you-go model.  And so, we left ourselves some room in the original guide that we could see attrition tick up. And what we experienced in Q1 is actually our attrition ticked down a little bit. We performed very well in the first quarter with slightly better attrition than we had seen historically. So we're very happy about that.  As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, though, as we head into this more recessionary-driven environment, we are adding a tick-up in attrition and a tick-down in utilization, just because we don't know what the recessionary environment holds for us and we are going to start there and put that stake in the ground and then we'll monitor it as we go from here. Shacey Petrovic : It\u2019s great, Wayde. And in terms of your second part of your question around reimbursement for the type 2 patients, one of the things we really like about the pharmacy channel is that there are \u2013 there isn't really a distinguishment between reimbursement for type 2 or type 1, if they require insulin. And so there are fewer restrictions.  It's a simpler channel to access your technology through and it really doesn't distinguish between type 1 or type 2, provided the patient is insulin-dependent and needs an insulin delivery mechanism. And then, of course, we always educate payers on the fact that Omnipod reduces total daily dose of insulin and provides very clear benefits for both patient segments.  And so, we've been fortunate to establish broad reimbursement through the pharmacy channel that doesn't distinguish between the two segments. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Travis Steed of Bank of America. Your line is open. Travis Steed : Congratulations on a strong Q1 and everything you're doing for patients. Wayde, I just wanted to make sure I fully understood the year-over-year reductions you gave in new patient starts. Were those reductions versus last year or versus your original guide?  And then, the change in the full year guide, it sounds like the majority of the change is coming from those new patient starts being lowered. I am just curious if there is any more color you could provide on what you are assuming on attrition and expansion of the patient support program. Wayde McMillan : Yes. Hi, Travis. Thank you. So to the first part of the question on new patient starts, it is versus our guide and our previous expectations for 2020. And of course, those are estimates, right? We have really good visibility into Q2, as I mentioned, walking through the two-stage sales cycle there.  And really good visibility for Q2, obviously, in this environment, there is going to be more uncertainty for the second half and what that holds. But we thought it was important to just lay out these key metrics and put a stake in the ground, so that we can then help you understand the key drivers for our business here and then we can message to it as we go throughout the year. As far as the full year guide goes, the key is new patient starts. We think that, that will be the most significant metric to watch for. If we just pull up and think about our business model, we have this advantage of a durable recurring revenue model. And so even when we see new patients get impacted like we did in March and the inability for our customers to get to the ENDO office, I mean, it's a really unique dynamic and with that, the momentum of our business carries.  And so we've got really strong growth rates in Q1. We're putting a strong guide in for Q2 and what we have to manage then is this compounding of new patient starts. So if we go through two or three quarters of restrained new patient starts, that's going to weigh on our growth rate, especially given the tough comps we had, because we performed so well at the end of last year. So when we annualize into that tough comp, we are going to have to manage through some lower growth rates in the second half.  But then, as expected, when we see our new patient starts start to build momentum through the end of the year again and then assuming when we get back to normal or a new normal, which is, as Shacey talked about earlier, may involve more telehealth, but we get back to a more new \u2013 a new normal where we're getting a regular cadence of new patient starts, then the momentum builds again and we start to drive our growth rates even higher.  So, we felt it was important to really lay out that new patient start dynamic. And then the other key metrics that I mentioned, utilization and attrition. We have ticked down utilization a little bit, attrition up a little bit. But the major driver here is new patient starts. So for that, we are going to watch it.  We are going to certainly benefit from the durability of this model here in the first half of the year. We are going to track these key metrics through the second half and then hopefully, we'll all move beyond this pandemic and get back to business here in 2021. Shacey Petrovic : And Travis, I'll just comment on your question regarding the patient assistance program. We don't look at that as hitting revenue, because these are patients who would not be able to afford the product anyways. And so I'm really, really proud of this program.  I am proud of the fact that Insulet was out front and that we can help support patients who otherwise might not be able to access the product. But we didn't view that as a revenue headwind, because those patients would have probably had traded off the product because they can't afford it. Wayde McMillan : Okay. Operator, we are over time. But why don't we try to get through at least one, maybe two more, please? Operator : Our next question, coming from the line of Matt O'Brien of Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Andrew Stafford : Hi guys. This is Drew on for Matt. Thank you for taking the question here. I wanted to start off a little bit on your sales channels a little bit. I believe you said about 30% of your volume was due to the pharmacy. Appreciate that color. And definitely should help you in this type of environment. But I guess, diving in on the other 70% of the business, are there any barriers presented by this epidemic outside of patient willingness, that kind of thing that could limit the patient access through the DME, be it\u2019s availability, people not being able to process paper work, anything like that? Shacey Petrovic : I think one of the challenges in the DME channel is the limitation of access for people living with type 2 diabetes. So that's one area where we likely will not see access or availability. And then, I am not sure about the others. We haven't really seen trends that would indicate that there is a particular challenge with the DME environment that isn't being experienced in the pharmacy channel with the exception of type 2 access. Wayde McMillan : Next question, please? Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Kyle Rose of Canaccord. Your line is open. Kyle Rose : Great. Thank you very much for taking the questions and congrats on a strong quarter. Two questions for me. One is, the delays on new patient starts and kind of the assumptions you are seeing in guidance, I appreciate the commentary around the decline in ENDO visits. But maybe just help us understand maybe the \u2013 what the falloff is like from leads to starts. Are you seeing bottlenecks more on the training side?  Is it more from a patient resources and economic side, just not wanting to commit to a pump at this time?  And then, just second question, I will ask it now, is just, what have you learned through this telemedicine and virtual training process that you think can \u2013 that you can apply towards Horizon launching and patient onboarding from that perspective as far as bringing down barriers to adoption and just improving the overall ease of use in the pump ecosystem from a longer-term perspective? Thank you. Shacey Petrovic : Great. I think Wayde can take the first part of your question and I'll address the second. Wayde McMillan : Sure. Sounds good. So we typically see a few weeks to a month lag between our sales leads, and then leading into our new patient starts. And so, as I mentioned, we saw the decline in sales leads really hit in March.  But our teams have done \u2013 this is in direct reference to Shacey's prepared remark, where she talked about the ability for the team to transition to working remotely and working through telehealth and we've done a great job through the end of March and into April transitioning what was in the pipeline into new patient starts.  And so, when we guide to a reduction in new patient starts of 50% to 75% for Q2, it is a result of looking at that sales lead pipeline, what happened to it in March, what we've seen happen to it in April and what we are calculating will be the impact in May and June. So that's the way the math works on that one. So from a training perspective, that you mentioned, Kyle is, our teams are doing a great job. As Shacey said, we are into the thousands in the first few weeks and ramping every day. And that's both U.S. and OUS. The IT teams have worked with the marketing teams to rapidly learn what are the bottlenecks \u2013 worked with the HCPs to find out what are the bottlenecks and these teams every day are clearing hurdles, and we are getting more efficient at being able to train people virtually. Shacey Petrovic : And I think on your question tied to what have we learned about Horizon, I mean we continue to learn every day. But I'll tell you that the most exciting thing from my perspective about Horizon is that, it really has been designed from the outset to be the simplest technology on the market and so that will lend itself very, very well to a telehealth environment.  And the other great thing about Horizon, besides its simplicity, is that there is real-time access to cloud data. And so that will be \u2013 that should enable some really easy and effective interactions between patients and physicians, whether they are happening in the clinic or in particular, if they are happening via telemedicine. Wayde McMillan : Next question, please? Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Danielle Antalffy of SVB Leerink. Your line is open. Danielle Antalffy : Hey, thanks. Thanks so much for squeezing me in. Congrats on a really strong quarter. It's good to see. I had a quick question on attrition and sort of what you are seeing or what, I guess, you saw in the last few weeks of the quarter. I know you have this patient assistance program. How you are seeing that be utilized? And yes, I guess, maybe let's start there. Wayde McMillan : Sure. So I can start, if you like, Shacey. And I just mentioned to a previous question there that through Q1, actually attrition was a little better than we've had historically. And so, in the face of the pay-as-you-go model where we thought we could see some higher attrition. We actually saw lower attrition.  As we get more acute into the month of March, it becomes harder to know if someone's actually attrited. It takes a bit of time to figure out if they've just skipped an order or if they've attrited. But we actually saw the opposite. I called out in the prepared remarks that we are estimating a $4 million of end-customer stocking.  And to break that down, we have really good insight into our direct business, which makes up about \u2013 still makes up almost half of our business. So, we know exactly when a customer asks for an order earlier than it would typically be shipped. And so, we estimated about $4 million worth of customers pulled the orders from Q2 into Q1.  And just to clarify for guidance for Q2, we are not assuming any impact in Q2. We are assuming Q2 has the same pull-ahead from Q3. And we expect that we'll see the other end of that headwind in the second half when it normalizes out. So, we kind of saw the opposite, Danielle, where we saw some strength in March, because of customers ordering. We are assuming we are going to see that again here in the second quarter.  As far as attrition goes, I think it's probably a little too early for recessionary impacts to start pushing on metrics like attrition in the first month here of April. So that one is still a TBD and we'll monitor that one very closely. As far as the financial systems program, we are not quantifying it right now, because we don't know exactly how many people are going to take advantage of that program and how utilized it will be. As Shacey mentioned, it's just really important for us and right in line with our mission to make sure that if there was someone who in the U.S. has lost their job and lost their insurance and whether they are in the process of getting coverage through Medicaid or another means to insurance, we wanted to be there to backstop them.  And so, we can't quantify that one at this time. I prioritized it in our list of gross margin headwinds at the end, because I think it'll be one of the smaller headwinds. But we'll \u2013 that one is yet to be determined. Danielle Antalffy : Okay. Great. I\u2019ll just leave it there. Thanks. Shacey Petrovic : Thanks, Danielle. Wayde McMillan : Thanks, Danielle. Shacey Petrovic : And then, we'll just take one last question please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Shacey Petrovic : We can leave it there then. Wayde McMillan : Yes. If there is no one on that, thanks. Shacey Petrovic : Yes. Thanks, operator. So, thank you. Despite volatile market conditions, we delivered strong operational and financial performance in the first quarter. The team adapted quickly to challenges and executed on behalf of our customers, shareholders and other stakeholders. So we'll continue to monitor the situation and keep you all updated to the best that we can during this unprecedented times. And I just want to close by thanking our global Insulet team across three continents for their relentless hard work and dedication. It's because of you, that our team remains safe and healthy, that our customers know they can rely on us, even in the face of this pandemic to get the product and support that they need. So thank you all for joining us today. And our heartfelt thoughts and wishes go out to all of you and your families to stay safe and stay healthy. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. And have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations. Deborah Gordon : Thank you, Lauren. Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us today for Insulet second quarter 2020 earnings call. With me Shacey Petrovic, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Wayde McMillan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The replay of this call will be archived on our website, and the press release discussing our second quarter 2020 results and third quarter and full year 2020 guidance is also available in the IR section of our website. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations. We ask that you please refer to the cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely adjusted EBITDA and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth excluding the effect of foreign exchange. These measures align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance, and we believe that they are helpful to investors, analysts and other interested parties as a measure of our comparative operating performance from period to period. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis, and all revenue growth rates will be on a constant currency basis. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Shacey. Shacey Petrovic : Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. While COVID-19 continues to challenge Insulet, our customers and our communities around the world. The dedication of our employees, partners and the healthcare providers, serving people with diabetes, helped us to deliver an extraordinary quarter on nearly every dimension. We achieved second quarter revenue of over $226 million, exceeding our expectations. This growth represented a 29% increase driven by 27% revenue growth in our total Omnipod product line. And it was a record revenue quarter across every single product line. Delivering these results in such uncertain times is a testament to the tremendous execution of our team. We are very fortunate to have strong fundamentals in place. The strength and durability of our recurring revenue model provide us significant insulation. Our performance in the first half of this year is reflective of our great momentum in 2019 and the first quarter of 2020. While we are seeing an impact of COVID, it\u2019s a two-part story for Insulet. There are many aspects of our performance that we celebrate. We are creating new ways to serve our customers that are more scalable and more engaging. We\u2019re making our supply chain and manufacturing operations more resilient and adding significant capacity in preparation for the Omnipod 5 launch next year. And even in the face of this pandemic, we are making exciting progress on our innovation programs. In the near-term, due to COVID impact on new starts, we have the reality of the compounding impact on our revenue growth rates in the second half of this year and the first half of next. But ultimately, we expect to grow total Omnipod revenue 18% to 20% in 2020, despite this impact. And we are building capabilities across the company to maximize our position in the market and serve our mission for many years to come. Insulet will emerge stronger and better from this challenge, thanks to our talented and committed team. On today\u2019s call, I\u2019m going to speak about how we are continuing to manage through the COVID environment, our achievements toward our strategic imperatives and our longer term expectations. Wayde will dive into the details of our financial results and guidance, and we will then take questions. We continue to grow our global customer base during the second quarter. As discussed on our last call, we had anticipated 50% to 75% fewer new Omnipod customers as compared to our original expectations at the start of the year. We landed closer to 50% exceeding our expectations. Our performance was driven by our commercial teams who throughout the quarter expanded utilization of our virtual onboarding tools, piloted novel programs to increase awareness and adoption of Omnipod and continue to expand affordable access to Omnipod across the globe. And it was supported by our innovation and operations teams who helped us to grow our manufacturing capacity and resilience and deliver an exciting new release of Omnipod DASH, while also advancing Omnipod 5 towards commercial launch. This quarter, we made continued progress on our strategic imperatives. One, to deliver consumer-focused innovation; two, ensure the best global customer experience; three, expand our global footprint; and four, drive operational excellence across the organization. Starting with consumer-focused innovation. The Omnipod form factor has been our key advantage since our founding. We hear from Podders around the world who come to us from MDI and other pumps that the ease of use and the freedom associated with the pod is life-changing. Over the last several years, we\u2019ve benefited from the differentiated form factor and increasing market access to grow our Omnipod customer base. Last year, we fully launched Omnipod DASH and our growth accelerated, even as other CGM integrated automated insulin delivery systems came to market. This is a testament to the value of our consumer-focused innovation, including relentless focus on ease of use, companion apps and cloud connectivity. And it is a testament to the compelling form factor of Omnipod. In a few quarters, users will no longer have to choose between the Omnipod form factor and CGM integrated automated insulin delivery. Omnipod 5 offers both. Adoption of Omnipod DASH continues to grow, driven by both the ease of use of the platform and our pay-as-you-go business model, primarily through the pharmacy channel in the United States. This is a uniquely differentiated offering that eliminates restrictions and makes treatment accessible to a broader range of customers. We continue to see strong adoption among MDI users in both the type 1 and type 2 segments. In the second quarter, approximately 30% of our U.S. new Omnipod customers were typed 2 consistent with last quarter. We continue to make great strides within the type 2 diabetes population. A market we are uniquely positioned to serve, given our differentiated product and our access through the pharmacy with no restrictions and no upfront costs. Coverage for Omnipod DASH continues to expand with approximately 65% of lives now covered, primarily through the pharmacy channel. In June, we also launched a major Omnipod DASH release, including several features that further improve simplicity and ease of use. These include automatic data uploads so that users and their clinicians have instant real-time cloud access to data without the need to connect and download from a computer. We have been working on that vision for years to streamline clinic workflow. And we have already heard from users how valuable this is to enable telehealth visits in our current environment. We can also now push future software updates wirelessly to our customers. And we are delighted to now offer Spanish language as an option for Omnipod DASH users in the United States. In the second quarter, we saw expanding use of our virtual patient onboarding tools, which have been well received by consumers and healthcare providers. The vast majority of our new customers were onboarded virtually. Omnipod simplicity and ease of use are clearly differentiated in this environment and both type 1 and type 2 MDI users can easily get started on Omnipod from the comfort of their homes. Our virtual training capabilities have helped to mitigate the impact of COVID on growth of new Omnipod customers. And they also lay a foundation for consumer-friendly, cost-effective and scalable onboarding of new users to Omnipod 5 when it launches. In addition to the success we\u2019re having with Omnipod DASH, we made great progress on Omnipod 5 and remain on track to launch in the first half of next year. We resumed our pivotal study in June and presented our first data from the Omnipod 5 pre-pivotal study at the American Diabetes Association Virtual Conference. The results demonstrated best-in-class usability and time and closed loop, excellent time and range and statistically significant improvements in hypoglycemia compared to prior therapy. More than half of the participants have completed the Omnipod 5 pivotal study, and all participants should finish by Q4 putting us in a solid position to launch Omnipod 5 in the first half of 2021. Virtually all cryo participants have enthusiastically requested to continue using Omnipod 5. So we are supporting an extension phase to enable them to remain on product. This allows us to collect additional longer term data, which will be helpful insights for clinicians, payers and for our Omnipod 5 innovation pipeline. Participant feedback has been terrific. Just last week, we were touched to hear from a parent who said \u201cwith Omnipod 5, I now have my child back, and my family has their mom back\u201d. We know that we\u2019re third to market, and as such, we didn\u2019t design Omnipod 5 just to be an incremental improvement automated insulin delivery. We designed our system to revolutionize insulin delivery for people living with Type 1 and insulin dependent Type 2 diabetes, and to bring AID to millions of people still relying on multiple daily injections. Omnipod 5 brings together the pods compelling form factor, excellent time and range, low hypoglycemia, customizable set points, and adaptively that is designed to limit the extent to which HCPs need to tweak the system to help users get great outcomes. Our platform will also offer unique benefits, including complete personal smartphone control, which eliminates the need for a separate PDM. Thanks to our effort to put the algorithm on the pod, we expect users to be able to download the Omnipod 5 app, pair with their pod and enjoy the benefits of Omnipod; no infusion sets, no separate controller and nothing else to think about. We also know that smartphone control isn\u2019t for everyone, but we wanted to ensure that our users could enjoy the benefits of real-time data being available in our companion apps and cloud data platform. Omnipod 5 PDMs will therefore include a SIM card. This enables every Omnipod user, even pediatrics without smartphones, and those without Wi-Fi to benefit from our companion apps that will provide real-time insulin and CGM data to caregivers, loved ones and clinicians. And all of this comes in a system that has been designed to be exceptionally easy to start and easy to use as evidenced by our remarkably high usability scores. We\u2019ve also begun to work on what comes after Omnipod 5. We see the Type 1 pump market nearly doubling in the coming years as more users discover the ease of use and clinical benefits of second generation AID systems like Omnipod 5 and beyond. And we see enormous opportunity to serve those living with insulin dependent Type 2 diabetes, given our unique form factor and pharmacy access. So we are investing to serve these growing markets. We are investing in next generation technologies and in demonstrating the benefits of Omnipod 5 in expanding populations, including very young pediatrics and people living with insulin dependent Type 2 diabetes. We are advancing our algorithm to increase automation, improve outcomes and further simplify the experience for users. And we are continuing to integrate our products with next generation technologies from our partners at Dexcom, Abbott and Tidepool, all with the goal to reduce burden and improve outcomes for the millions of people living with insulin dependent diabetes across the globe. Now turning to our progress in our international markets; this area of our business has been more heavily impacted by the pandemic and we are seeing a slower recovery in some European markets. This does not diminish our enthusiasm for our international opportunity, both in terms of continued growth in our existing markets and expansion into others with significant unmet need. We made good progress throughout the quarter, preparing our markets for the expansion of our Omnipod DASH launch. Our limited market release in the UK, Netherlands and Italy was successful and our customers love the product. The international team has been focused on training, market readiness and launch preparations, and we\u2019re looking forward to moving into full market release with Omnipod DASH early next year. And finally, turning to operational excellence; for the last four years, we have been strengthening our global manufacturing and supply chain operations. We have increased capacity and made our operations more resilient with the addition of our U.S. manufacturing plant to compliment our facility in China. This has served us especially well during the current pandemic. As many of you know, during the last 15 months, we began producing Omnipod on our first two highly automated U.S. manufacturing lines. Although the pandemic has had an impact on how quickly we\u2019ve been able to ramp these lines, we continue to increase capacity and gain efficiencies throughout our global operations. In the near-term, this ensures we can deliver the highest quality product to each and every one of our customers. Over the long-term, our U.S. manufacturing will provide required capacity and support as demand for our products continues to grow. We plan to further expand our U.S. manufacturing capacity across our supply chain and manufacturing operations, to prepare for what we are confident will be enthusiastic demand for Omnipod 5. As part of our corporate sustainability goals, we have taken steps to reduce the environmental impact of our supply chain and operations. To this end, we have localized a large portion of our supply chain to reduce logistics emissions. We also moved to ocean freight, which has the benefit of being both cost \u2013 more cost effective and more environmentally friendly. In June, as a further step, we transitioned our company headquarters and U.S. manufacturing facility to be fully powered by solar-based renewable energy. We understand the urgency and importance to protect our environment and reduce our carbon footprint. And we are committed to fostering a sustainable business to support the long-term wellbeing of our customers, our employees and our communities. In summary, while there are certainly short-term challenges that our business faces due to COVID, our team is rising to these challenges in remarkable ways. The strength and durability of our recurring revenue model provide us significant insulation and differentiation and are key to our ability to continue to deliver attractive growth in these uncertain times. Our investments in product and business model innovations and our talented dedicated team, position us over the long-term to drive strong organic growth and value creation and to bring powerful new technologies to market; and most importantly, to improve the lives of people living with diabetes. I will now turn the call over to Wayde. Wayde McMillan : Thank you. I want to echo Shacey\u2019s gratitude to our Insulet team members who have adapted to these extraordinary times. Thanks to their hard work, we delivered another quarter of strong financial results that exceeded our expectations. We continue to make excellent progress on our strategic imperatives as we invest for growth, enhance our global competitive differentiation and serve our mission of improving the lives of people with diabetes. In the second quarter of 2020, we delivered revenue growth of 29%, which was $10 million above our guidance range. This strong performance continues to be fueled by our total Omnipod growth of 27% and was $6 million above our guidance range. Regarding new Omnipod starts, we communicated that our guidance for Q2 included an estimate that the pandemic would lower our expectations from the beginning of the year by 50% to 75% with the U.S. closer to 50% and international closer to 75%. Actual Q2 results were favorable in both regions, as the combined impact was approximately 50%. Attrition and utilization came in near expected levels with slightly higher attrition and slightly lower utilization. Breaking down our revenue results by product line, U.S. Omnipod revenue grew 31% exceeding our guidance range of 21% to 25%. Approximately $4 million to $5 million of the increase resulted from the net impact of estimated distributor channel and end customer inventory levels. In Q2, we grew U.S. volume through the pharmacy channel to over 30% of our total volume. Pharmacy channel growth contributed to the increased inventory levels. Stocking for the pandemic also drove channel inventory increases across all three channels, including our DME and Direct. New Omnipod starts were also favorable versus our expectations. Our growing customer base and Omnipod DASH adoption primarily through the pharmacy channel, as well as the mixed benefit from the premium on DASH, continued to be the primary drivers of our growth. In the second quarter, volume growth of Omnipod DASH continued to drive over 60% of our U.S. new Omnipod starts. International Omnipod revenue grew 20% compared to our range of 15% to 19%, including a benefit of approximately $2 million of channel inventory build due to COVID and to a lesser extent, better than expected new Omnipod starts. Drug delivery revenue increased 49% to $24 million, which was $4 million above our guidance range. While we expected greater than normal revenue growth in Q2 resulting from the shift in timing of production from Q1, the overachievement was due to our partners increased forecast related to the current environment. Overall, we achieved robust revenue growth in the second quarter building off of our strong momentum from 2019 and Q1 of 2020. Turning to gross margin. We delivered 63%, down 270 basis points year-over-year in line with our expectations. The year-over-year change, included headwinds primarily due to the ramp of our U.S. manufacturing lines, as well as an approximate 180 basis point unfavorable impact from COVID-related costs and 40 basis points from foreign exchange. These headwinds were partially offset by the favorable revenue mix benefit from Omnipod DASH growth through the pharmacy channel and pay-as-you-go business model with no upfront charge for the PDM, as well as continued improvements throughout our global manufacturing and supply chain operations. Operating expenses in the second quarter were in line with our expectations and we ended the quarter with adjusted EBITDA of 20%. Our strong adjusted EBITDA was due to the favorable revenue performance, lower travel and meeting expenses and timing of certain expenses, including Omnipod 5 clinical trial expenses, much of which moved from the second quarter into the third quarter. Regarding cash and liquidity, we are in a strong cash position with the earliest debt maturing in 2024 and low cash interest expense. We ended the second quarter with $868 million in cash and investments, including the additional cash raise of $477 million from the equity offering in May. The cash raise strengthen our balance sheet and ensures we can continue to invest for growth, including R&D, commercial and capital expenditures in order to execute our strategic imperatives and provide additional liquidity during the pandemic, should we need it. We have a differentiated position in a large and under-penetrated market, and we want to come out of this pandemic stronger by continuing to grow in our global markets. Turning to guidance. Although COVID impacts are not predictable, last quarter we continue to provide guidance in order to help investors forecast our business, understand our growth drivers and highlight the areas of the business that will be most impacted. Given the information we had and an estimate of the impact of the macro indicators, along with the durability of our recurring revenue model, we maintained our full year 2020 revenue guidance at the low end of our original total company range. As a result of second quarter revenue that exceeded expectations and a stronger second half outlook, we are raising our total company full year 2020 revenue guidance growth rate to a range of 17% to 19% up from our previous expectation of 15%. This includes raising total Omnipod to a range of 18% to 20%. By product line for U.S. Omnipod, we\u2019re raising our expected revenue growth to 19% to 21%. And for international Omnipod, we\u2019re raising our expectations to 17% to 19%. The key drivers of our increased full year guidance for total Omnipod are the compounding benefit of second quarter hire new Omnipod starts, which add incremental revenue in the second half of the year and our expectations of improved new Omnipod starts in the third quarter. In terms of expected new Omnipod starts, our guidance now assumes an improvement in the third quarter, global new starts compared to our guide last quarter. We now estimate that new starts will be approximately 30% to 50% lower than our beginning of year estimate with the U.S. again at the low end and international near the high end. This compares to the 50% we guided to on our Q1 call. We anticipate fourth quarter global new starts will still be approximately 25% lower, consistent with last quarter\u2019s guide. This results in the achievement of approximately 60% to 75% of our original pre-COVID assumptions at the start of the year. Our revised guidance of new Omnipod starts factors in a gradual improvement from Q2 to year end. We continue to assume downward pressure on utilization and an uptick in attrition to account for potential pandemic related headwinds. While current trends are beginning to show signs of improving conditions, COVID continues to create uncertainties and it is difficult to accurately predict the progression Of the pandemic. Our global diabetes business remains well positioned to manage through multiple scenarios and continue strong growth this year, as well as in 2021 and over the long-term. Lastly, for drug delivery, we now anticipate growth of 3% to 6% resulting from the increased forecast from our business partner. Turning to the rest of the P&L. On a full year basis, we are reaffirming gross margin of approximately 63%, which includes an estimated $7 million to $10 million of one-time costs related to COVID safety and mitigation efforts versus our prior guide of $5 million to $10 million. Also factored in is the slower ramp in our U.S. manufacturing lines due to the pandemic. Our 2020 and long-term financial strategy and capital deployment plan remain unchanged. And we continue to expect capital expenditures to be consistent with last year, as we plan to invest for growth in our innovation pipeline, global commercial initiatives and with our manufacturing and supply chain operations. For full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA, we are reaffirming our expectation as a percentage of revenue at the low end of the 13% to 17% range. For the third quarter of 2020, we are guiding to total company revenue growth of 13% to 15%. This includes total Omnipod revenue growth of 12% to 14%. By product line, we expect U.S. Omnipod growth of 14% to 16%, international Omnipod of 9% to 11% and drug delivery of 23% to 28%. As a reminder, the pandemics impact on our global new starts in the second quarter has a compounding effect on revenue, which mostly impacts the second half of the year. Nevertheless, the durability of our differentiated recurring revenue model insulates us to a large degree, since we generate the vast majority of our revenue from our large existing customer base. As a result, we still plan to achieve double-digit revenue growth in the third quarter of 2020 and the full year, despite the impact of COVID. For our 2021 outlook, assuming market conditions stabilized in 2021, we remain on track to deliver our long range plan target of $1 billion in revenue. As communicated on our Q1 earnings call, we expect gross margin of 67% to 70% and operating income as a percentage of revenue in the mid teens, closer to the low end of the range. In conclusion, we had significant momentum to start the year and our first half 2020 results benefited from that momentum. Our differentiated business model and product platform, operational excellence and strong financial profile enable us to continue to invest for growth, while mitigating the impacts of COVID and related headwinds. As a result, we expect to deliver 18% to 20% revenue growth this year. We have a very healthy and robust business and are well positioned for continued growth over the long-term. With that, we\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Larry Biegelsen : Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a nice quarter. Shacey, just one on Omnipod 5 for you and Wayde one for you on the margin. So Shacey, just any update on the timeline for iOS integration and how are you feeling about price premium for Omnipod 5 versus DASH? And Wayde, on the 2021 gross margin, can you talk about the drivers to that 67% to 70%? Should we be thinking about the low end? It\u2019s a pretty big step up from a 63% in 2020. Thanks for taking the questions guys. Shacey Petrovic : Great. Thanks, Larry. So in terms of iOS, we have not guided any timeframe there, only to say, that we fully expect to follow our initial launch on Android with iOS. So that work is underway and is that timeline becomes more clear, we\u2019ll communicate that out. First, we want to get Omnipod 5 to market, which is coming soon. And in terms of a price premium, and we also haven\u2019t given much insight into our price strategy. The one thing, I will highlight though, is we are entirely committed to a pay-as-you-go model in the United States with Omnipod 5. And so what that means is all of our existing DASH users will be able to transition to Omnipod 5 without having to worry about a lock-in period or having to pay some sort of upgrade fee. Now that doesn\u2019t mean that Omnipod 5 doesn\u2019t warrant a premium, because obviously, the performance in terms of hypoglycemia and other key performance indicators certainly deliver value to the market and so that\u2019s what\u2019s being evaluated. But we are committed to the pay-as-you-go model. And that\u2019s important for us because as we think about the pace of innovation increasing in the market, we want to be positioned to be able to deliver that innovation most quickly to our customers and not make them wait out these industry warranty periods, et cetera. So that we\u2019re committed to and we\u2019ll see on the price premium. Wayde McMillan : Okay. And Larry on the margins for 2021, first of all, margins are an important part of the story for us. We have significant strategies running across the business to make sure that we have the strongest gross margins possible. And we see them as a big part of the differentiated story here for us. And when we look at the most recent quarter, what we\u2019ve called out in impact from COVID 180 basis points in foreign exchange. So if you take out those two, one items, the most recent quarter would be 65%. So COVID is having a pretty significant impact as well as FX on our gross margins. So that takes a bit of a step up away. And then when we look at how we progress in 2021, we have made a significant investment in our manufacturing operations, mainly here in the U.S. but also in our China facility. And we continue to make progress on our operations as well as our supply chain efficiencies. And so we have high confidence that we will get into the 67% to 70% range in 2021. And we still have high confidence that we can get to 70% over time. We\u2019re just a bit delayed here for a quarter or two, as our teams have shifted focus to deal with COVID and the safety and mitigation efforts related to that. But it has not diminished our game plan at all to push for 70% gross margins. And I know the team is doing a lot to keep that in focus while they deal with the current environment. And I know that we\u2019ll get back on track here in the next couple of quarters and be confident when we issue our guidance for 2021. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Robbie Marcus : Thanks. And there\u2019s a lot I can ask about in the quarter here. But Shacey, I actually want to focus on two longer term focus questions on points that you made. The first was that the number of pump users could double over the coming years. I\u2019m guessing coming means something like 5-ish. So if there is 400,000, 500,000 pump users in the U.S., I mean, that\u2019s a massive new patient opportunity over the next several years. I just want to make sure that I\u2019m thinking about the right way and how should we think about the number that Insulet can possibly grab during that time? Shacey Petrovic : Yes. You\u2019re seeing it the way we see it Robbie. We see this pretty significant technology inflection happening in Type 1 and actually beginning to happen in Type 2. So I think a lot of this is driven by adoption of CGM. And then, of course, we know that there\u2019s going to be great demand. It\u2019s one of the most anticipated developments in the pipeline with Omnipod 5. And so we do see that, we\u2019ve always said, we thought 50% was a pretty reasonable estimate for penetration into the pump market because you just needed to look at pediatrics. But we\u2019re seeing even pediatrics expand utilization of pumps in Type 1 pretty rapidly. And then I think this expansion of CGM has really driven more adoption too. So we do see that as a realistic TAM for us and an exciting one. And then we look at CGM, penetrating into Type 2s now, for us, that\u2019s just pipeline. We see a tremendous opportunity to bring Omnipod 5 to people living with Type 2 insulin-dependent diabetes. And I would say, we have the right to win in both of those markets. We have the specific obviously, really differentiated form factor advantages, and really excited about what integration with our sensor partners will bring to both of those populations. Robbie Marcus : Thanks. And maybe if we think about, Shacey, the comments you made on the lower new patient adds in 2020, and that will impact the back part of this year and the first half of next year. I just want to make sure, do you see something with street numbers that worry you? We all know this is a recurring revenue business model and fewer new patients starts equal somewhat of a headwind next year. Does something worry you about where the Street is for next year? Because seeing what your competitor is doing with an integrated offering, Horizon 5, potentially, should be even better. There\u2019s a lot of enthusiasm around the launch next year. I just want to make sure that\u2019s more just the reality of the business model rather than trying to talk down expectations. Thanks. Shacey Petrovic : That\u2019s right, Robbie. We are not worried. I just always take the opportunity because we have such a different business model relative to obviously other insulin pump players out there. Just to educate on that. And Wayde, I don\u2019t know if you have any other color you want to add regarding the Street estimates. Wayde McMillan : Yes. No, first of all, it\u2019s a really good question, because one of the reasons we elected to provide guidance last quarter was to give insight for people to understand our business model. And so the reason that Shacey is highlighting here, just to remind people that in the recurring business model that we\u2019ll be dealing with this headwind for the second two quarters of this year and into the first half of next year. But having said that, we have a lot of positive drivers in the business and when we \u2013 as specific with to your question on estimates that are out there, we have raised our guidance more than for the Q2 beat here. And so there should be some room in the second half, as you know, we\u2019ve also taken up the second half guidance. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. David Lewis : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Just a two number of questions for me, I\u2019ll start with Shacey. So Shacey, during this earning season, a lot of diabetes companies have talked about international sluggishness recovery related to the U.S. and just sort of, can you walk us through for your business and how this dynamics ex-U.S., or varying versus the U.S.? Is it a country specific, or do you think it\u2019s across multiple regions of your ex-U.S. business? Shacey Petrovic : Sure. Yes, David and you\u2019ve hit on it. The recovery that we\u2019re seeing in Europe is definitely more modest than what we\u2019re seeing in the U.S. today. And it is very much varied across the markets. Some are doing okay. And then others like France, which is obviously an important market for us is still very challenged. As hospitals don\u2019t open and many of those new patients would be served by the prestataire and they are occupied with other priorities. And so it\u2019s kind of a tale of multiple parts across Europe. And the other area that is more challenged is endo visits. And so there\u2019s been slower uptake of telehealth in Europe and many larger European markets see their Omnipod or new pump starts in hospital, the clinics rather than in private offices. And so obviously, hospitals are really challenged right now in many parts of the world. So I think, we\u2019re seeing encouraging things across all of our markets in terms of \u2013 endo visits starting to reopen in terms of our pipeline and new starts. But we\u2019re not back to normal still know that endo visits even in the United States are not back to where they were pre-COVID levels. So it\u2019s encouraging, but in the \u2013 in Europe, we are forecasting that it will be a much more moderate recovery from here through the rest of the year. David Lewis : Okay. Very helpful. And then kind of related question, just thinking about the broader new patient start impact. So, improving here in the third quarter guidance from prior, you\u2019re still saying 25% new patients start impact for the fourth quarter. So, the way to think about that is that simply a reflection of a conservatism or if I say you\u2019re ahead of pace here, you\u2019re sort of assuming, you\u2019re a little ahead of pace, but resurgence of flu season and what have you could impact that in the fourth quarter. And I guess, the question I would say is, I would sort of assume that the channel will be more able to handle a resurgence given telehealth patient conditioning, physician conditioning in the back half of the year. So, just help us understand that 25% maintenance relative to the improvement in the third quarter? Thanks so much. Wayde McMillan : Yes. This is the most important metric for us. Our attrition and utilization metrics, although ticked up are very similar versus our historic levels. So, it really is all about new patients starts for us. And we\u2019ve estimated the U.S. around a third impacted here in Q3. And as Shacey said, given the dynamics internationally, we\u2019ve called it 50% internationally impact, it is \u2013 we\u2019re seeing a slower recovery there. And that is exactly it; we\u2019re just making sure that we keep some room for ourselves for resurgence here. And if we see headwinds in certain states within the U.S. or regions outside the U.S. start to be more impacted obviously, at the low end of the range of 50% impact overall for us, would mean Q3 would have to look like Q2, and we hope that we\u2019re not going back there. We \u2013 that\u2019s the low end. We hope that we can improve on that. Get closer to the 30% at the high end of the range and that\u2019s on a global basis. So that would mean that the regions combined would have to be 30% for us to be at the high end of the range. And so we see a lot of different scenarios playing out. Obviously, we don\u2019t know where the pandemic is heading? We\u2019re trying to do our best to give ourselves a good estimate here. If we think about why we set guidance originally, it was to put these stakes in the ground, so that we can then help everybody understand how we\u2019re performing against them. And in Q2, we did very well, came in at the bottom end of the range and beat expectations in both regions. So, we\u2019ve moved the steak a little bit more favorable here in Q3. We\u2019ll see how the pandemic progresses. And then the last part of the question, David, around telehealth for the endos and for us virtual training, it has changed the game. I think the benefit of virtual training and the ability for patients to still get the therapy they need, even in a COVID-related world. We have the capability to do that, as Shacey said; most of our trainings in Q2 were virtual. And so we have that capability built now, and that should help us offset, what could have been a worse impact. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson of Baird. Your line is now open. Jeff Johnson : Thank you. Good afternoon. Shacey, I wanted to go back to some of the comments you made on Omnipod 5 in some of the potential competitive advantages, you\u2019ve listed through form factor and customization, and what have you? I thought the adaptability point you made was interesting, and we\u2019d love to hear you maybe flesh that out a little bit. I\u2019m not sure off the top of my head; I know, exactly what you were referring to there? Thanks. And then I do have a follow-up. Thanks. Shacey Petrovic : Sure, Jeff. Yes. So, when I talk about adaptability, I\u2019m really referring to other systems that are in the market, where the \u2013 there are still many dobbs \u2013 knobs and dials to adjust on these systems in terms of various inputs regarding, for example your basal rate or your total daily dose, or your insulin to carb ratio, such that, if the algorithm and the system is not working aggressively enough or in a satisfactory way for the patient that they have to go back into the physician and have adjustment made in order for the system to work more effectively for them. Our system and the algorithm has really been designed to grow and learn with the patient and consciously, we\u2019ve taken a lot of those knobs and dials away, so that the system can actually do its job and simply adapt and perform better for the patient. And so that really, the goal there is to make it much easier, both for the clinician and for the patient, and to rely on the algorithm, to grow with the user. So, there are examples of, if the user adopts a new exercise routine, that means that their insulins, they require potentially less insulin. The system is designed to notice that and to learn and adjust; same thing with children as they get older, they may require more insulin. The system is designed to see that and adjust to that. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re really excited about what adaptability will bring. We\u2019re also really excited just about the flexibility of the system. We\u2019ve talked about customizable set points and other things with the system that should make it just incredibly user-friendly. And I think that was demonstrated at ADA when the moderator compared our usability scores to iPhones. I mean, that\u2019s really how simple the system is designed to be. Jeff Johnson : Yes. Understood. Very helpful. And then Wayde maybe just \u2013 I think you mentioned here just in passing to David\u2019s question that ask was maybe down closer to that 33% or a third below your expectations at the start of the year and I know that\u2019s relative to expectations. I think if I look at your \u2013 one of your competitors, who gives pretty clear numbers and you can back into numbers, their new patients starts in 2Q seemed like they might have been flat even up 10% or 15% year-over-year from MDI population perspective. So, if your new patient starts in to 2Q again, relative to expectations, but if I adjusted that maybe, down 10% or 15% or something, help me bridge that gap, maybe between a competitor be in flat to up and you guys may be in down year-over-year on new patient starts from the MDI channel. Thanks. Wayde McMillan : Sure. Well, just to start with, we still get most of our new patients from the MDI channel. So, it\u2019s about 80% and I can\u2019t really speak to the math for the competitors, but certainly, can give you more insight to our pipeline. We had record new patient starts quarter-on-quarter coming into 2020, and we set our guidance appropriately, and we\u2019re not expecting continued record new patients start quarters every year, but we still had a pretty significant number of new patients starts in there. And so still coming in at 50% of our expectations globally is strong. And the U.S. was better than the 50% and had a pretty good quarter there as well as evidenced by the 31% growth rate in the quarter. We certainly got the benefit of inventory there. But we\u2019re still mid-20s growth rates for the U.S. And so although we were exceeding that in the last few quarters of 2019, I think at 26%, 27% growth rate ex-inventory build is still a really healthy quarter. So, it gives you a sense of yes, we\u2019re off our expectations for the year, but still very strong new patient start growth. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citibank. Your line is now open. Joanne Wuensch : Good evening, everybody. And thank you for taking the questions. I have two quick ones. I think. you mentioned the moderator at ADA and the commentary there, we really haven\u2019t had the chance to sort of group catch up with you post-ADA. And I was curious if there\u2019s anything else you want to highlight that really caught your eye? Shacey Petrovic : Coming out of ADA, I think, what would be noticeable is just that we\u2019re in this sort of technology adoption and pace of technology increasing in the market for people living with diabetes. It\u2019s just a really exciting time. I mean, there were multiple AID systems, multiple next generation sensors presented. And so when we think about, what that could bring to people living with the disease, it\u2019s very exciting. To me, it\u2019s part of why we remain so bullish on adoption of technology among people living with both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. And obviously, we\u2019re really excited about the role that we\u2019ll play in that. I think this year\u2019s ADA, if you just looked at the enthusiasm, I think there were thousands and thousands of physicians, who had dialed into to listen to our presentations. There\u2019s just tremendous enthusiasm for automated insulin delivery and what it will bring to the community. Joanne Wuensch : And my second question is, as you prepare for Omnipod 5 launch, can you walk us through sort of the steps that you think about, so that you\u2019re not in back order supply right out of the gate once it\u2019s out the door? Shacey Petrovic : Sure, sure. I think that\u2019s a great question. We\u2019re thinking a lot about that right now. We\u2019ve been \u2013 obviously; I highlighted it in my remarks. We\u2019ve been already thinking about, how do we build capacity and be in a position to be a very strong from an inventory position. The next steps for us outside of getting through our clinical work and securing clearance are to really think about market access. As I mentioned with Larry at the first question, we are committed to this pay as you go model. And so what that means is that everybody will be able to transition to Omnipod 5, as soon as they have access. We\u2019re not going to regulating this with a four-year warranty period or upgrade fees or anything like that, which means there\u2019s going to be tremendous demand both among our existing users and what we anticipate to be tremendous demand among new users. And a lot of that will be regulated by access. And so our teams are already now thinking about how do they rapidly expand access, particularly in our pharmacy channel. I think we\u2019re very fortunate, because we did all of the work to really establish our \u2013 both the new business model, the new wholesaler distribution and the pharmacy access. And so this should go much more smoothly and much more rapidly than it did with DASH. And actually, it went very well with DASH. But that work is already underway as well. And then we\u2019ve had a lot of work going on around onboarding and training of patients, which is why we were ahead of the game in terms of being able to launch all of our virtual tools with Omnipod during the pandemic. But what\u2019s great about the experience that we\u2019ve had is that we know that patients of all sorts of demographics can be very happily and successfully trained at home. And we had less of an experience before the pandemic. Now, we know it for certain across all patient demographics. And so that sets us up, I think, for a lot of success rapidly and cost-effectively being able to bring patients onto Omnipod 5. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with SVB Leerink. your line is now open. Danielle Antalffy : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions and congrats on, on a really strong quarter, given \u2013 given all that everyone\u2019s going through right now. Wayde, if I could, just one question on the guidance, sorry to harp on this, but I guess as I look through the back half of the year implied guidance for Q4 plus what you gave for Q3. it does look like on a comp adjusted basis, growth is decelerating. And I\u2019m just curious to pick your brain a little bit more about that. Just given the fact that it feels like we\u2019re past peak unemployment, right. So, it feels like attrition should actually stabilize at this point to move lower. Am I thinking about that wrong? And it feels like new patient ads should start to accelerate maybe, just a little bit of color there would be great. Wayde McMillan : Sure. And I hope you\u2019re right. on unemployment, I think we\u2019ve got long ways to go to understand, where we\u2019re at in this pandemic. But it really speaks to the point that Shacey highlighted in her opening remarks and that I provided some more detail in my remarks as well, is the way that our business model works. And when we take half, the new patients starts that we\u2019re planning out of Q2 and even though we have an improving Q3 and improving Q4 through the end of the year, when you take new patient starts out, it creates a headwind to the growth rate compared to last year. So, it really highlights the very tough comp that we created for ourselves in 2019. If you think about, where we were in the second half of 2019, we launched DASH. we entered the pharmacy channel and we launched our pay-as-you-go model. So, we had record new patient starts quarter-on-quarter through the end of 2019. So, we set up some very tough comps and you can look at the comps individually by metric; sales, price, utilization, attrition. And if all of those are fairly consistent, it\u2019s all about new patient starts. And so with the COVID headwinds here, although we have improving new patient starts through the end of the year. by no means, are we stacking up new patients starts on a record-breaking nature like we did last year. So that\u2019s going to impact our growth rates with those tough comps. We\u2019ll see how we go, pandemic is making forecasting more challenging than ever. I like that we put these stakes in the ground last quarter. We\u2019re going to continue to measure ourselves against them, see how we do here again in Q3. Danielle Antalffy : Yes. thanks for that. And yes, I was going to say, Wayde, that really \u2013 this pandemic is really making you work hard for your money there. The follow-up question I had was on a potential bolus of new patients, and I\u2019m not sure how you guys are thinking about this. but I guess, as patients start to sort of go back to their endo, do you expect to see a bolus of new patients at some point; anecdotally, I have a friend who just recently got diagnosed. He wants to go on the Omnipod. He\u2019s waiting though. And so just curious to see how you guys are thinking about a potential bolus at some point. Shacey Petrovic : Yes. Thanks, Danielle. It is something we\u2019re thinking about. it\u2019s difficult to predict obviously. But we do know that endo; in the U.S., where we have the most visibility. We do know that endo visits are down still significantly. And so \u2013 and then there\u2019s a portion that\u2019s just happening by a telehealth, people are less likely, and physicians are less likely to transition to new technologies via telehealth than they are in in-person visits. So, I do think that there is this dynamic, where people who probably need better technology and better care are not getting it today. And that\u2019s really concerning, frankly, because it\u2019s a vulnerable population as it relates to COVID. And so I will do everything that we can to educate the community, educate clinicians about this and that there\u2019s, it\u2019s very easy to transition to get a prescription to be able to trial the device and be able to get started at home. And there may very well be a bolus of people. we are not counting on it. But certainly, I hope that everybody who needs care is getting it, or we\u2019ll get it soon as the economy start to continue to reopen. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Margaret Kaczor with William Blair. Your line is now open. Margaret Kaczor : Hey, everyone. thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the quarter. I wanted to follow up first on virtual training. There\u2019s a lot of benefits now. you\u2019ve kind of alluded to the future benefits and can you outline for us maybe, the speed of patients coming on. how that differs versus in-person as well as the cost? And I guess in a nutshell, is this hundreds of basis points of margin, for example, in the time or can you cut down the time by a third? Shacey Petrovic : So, I\u2019ll start with the first part and then maybe Wayde can comment although I don\u2019t know how much insight we have yet into sort of the cost differential or the impact on margin. I will say that just feedback from both clinicians, who have attended trainings in some cases with their patients that we\u2019re hosting virtually as well as directly from new customers has been absolutely fantastic regarding virtual training. And one of the pieces of the feedback is that it\u2019s just much easier to schedule in everybody\u2019s life. And so certainly, we see an easier time getting scheduled and we can also leverage our field team better in terms of being able to automatically schedule them and have people support multiple areas or multiple territories. And so I think all of those things bode well and we view this, as I said very much as not just a temporary thing that we\u2019re doing to support patients and clinicians during COVID. but as a viable, very exciting way that we can scale our Omnipod 5 training and delight customers, because it\u2019s clear that people love being trained in the comfort of their own homes. Wayde McMillan : Yes. I think the only thing I could add there really is, just keep in mind what Shacey said it\u2019s early days. I think there\u2019s some silver linings with the COVID pandemic here. and maybe, one of them is a situation, where we\u2019re forced into more virtual trainings, both us to support it as well as patients and physicians. And I think we\u2019re all learning that there are some benefits. patients enjoy getting trained at home in the comfort of their own homes and we\u2019re finding out that it could be more efficient as Shacey said. We don\u2019t have to have our clinical reps in \u2013 within driving distance of all the customers that we want to bring on in person. So, there are certainly efficiencies to be gained. The real question is how large of a percentage does virtual training become over time. There are benefits to being in person. We know that clinicians see a lot of those benefits to seeing their patients in person. So, I think it\u2019s going to be a mixed bag over time. Margaret, I think just we\u2019ll keep in mind that it\u2019s early days, we\u2019re learning a lot. We certainly know a lot more now than we did at the start of Q2. Margaret Kaczor : Okay, great. Helpful. And then I just wanted to follow up in terms of some of the commentary on next generation products. You guys, obviously, you find the treasure around the corner, and you\u2019re already starting to talk about G6, maybe some other software, digital health advancements. but as you guys look at that next generation product, you referenced type two. So, I assume you\u2019ve kind of done a little bit of work of what are the primary gatekeepers showed adoption, why haven\u2019t pumps succeeded and access is one, but how do you address some of the other issues on the engineering side, limiting patient touch and seamlessness and the payers. Shacey Petrovic : Sure. Margaret, I think it\u2019s a good question. I actually think we\u2019ve learned a lot, because of DASH. I mean, we\u2019ve seen a great uptake in this patient population as a result of the simplicity of the platform and just how powerful pharmacy access is. In that experience and understanding how that user segment is using DASH has given us insight into how Omnipod 5 five and future generations of omnipod 5 could be impactful in that population. So, I don\u2019t want to reveal too much there from a competitive standpoint, but I will say that you\u2019ll see us start the clinical work just to evaluate our technology in that population. And I think we\u2019ll learn even more then, and we\u2019re confident based on our experience with DASH and based on the fact that more and more people living with insulin dependent type 2 are adopting CGM, that we have a great technology to bring to that market. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jayson Bedford of Raymond James. Your line is now open. Jayson Bedford : Hi, good afternoon. Just a few quick clarification questions. On the 2Q new patient ads, you did 50% of your original goal. Did you quantify the level between U.S. and international? Wayde McMillan : Hi, Jayson, we have not, but we can provide a little more color. The U.S. was better than the 50% and outside the U.S. was higher than the 50%. The combination of the two got us to the 50% for the quarter. Jayson Bedford : Okay. What was the estimated impact of stocking in 2Q? I think, I thought it was $6 million to $7 million, but I just want to be strong there? Wayde McMillan : Sure. It was actually very similar to Q1. So in the U.S., we had an impact of $4 million to $5 million and for outside the U.S., it was $2 million, so a global $6 million to $7 million impact. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Travis Steed with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Travis Steed : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I\u2019ll ask both of mine upfront in interest of time. Wayde, the 30% to 50% that you\u2019re guarding to below expectations for Q3, just curious how that compares to what you\u2019re seeing in June and July, if you\u2019re assuming get worsen here, or assuming that were stable? And then Shacey on horizon, just kind of walked through some of the roadmap here between finishing up the trial, submitting the data. When we\u2019re going to see the data and some of the gating factors to launch that earlier in the first half versus later in the second half? Thanks for taking the questions. Shacey Petrovic : Sure. Wayde McMillan : Hey, Travis, I can start. Yes. So in regards to the Q3, 30% to 50% new patients start reduction from expectations, that is better than we saw in Q2, it was 50% in Q2. So by definition, everything below 50% will be better just to clarify that. And that is as a result of seeing gradual improvement coming out of Q2 into July. So it is different by region, as I mentioned upfront, every state, we see our reps in some cases getting back and meeting with customers and physicians and then in some cases that stops. Clinic-by-clinic, they\u2019re turning on, turning off. There is a lot of variability, as Shacey said, just across the U.S. And outside the U.S., it\u2019s a tough call because some countries are opening up and doing better. And as Shacey referenced, some countries are almost nil and still locked down and really not bringing on new patients. So very much a mixed bag out there, but just generally, we are starting to see improvements coming out of Q2, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re guiding to more of a 30% to 50% or a third to a half versus a half that we saw on Q2. Shacey Petrovic : That\u2019s great. Thanks. And then your question regarding Omnipod 5 five. So as I mentioned in my remarks, all of our patients will be completed or all participants will be completed with the Omnipod 5 study at the \u2013 by Q4. And then we don\u2019t \u2013 just as general practice, we don\u2019t give estimates on submission, but that timing of completion of participants in the trial gives us great confidence in our limited market release in the first half of 2020. And then in terms of data, we\u2019ve been invited to share our data at ATTD. So we will definitely expect to do that, as that takes place in February, and is likely to be a virtual conference. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt O\u2019Brien with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Jason Bednar : Hi, good afternoon. This is Jason on for Matt, and thanks for taking the questions and squeezing us in here. Really just focused on one point here, Shacey, just wondering if there\u2019s any newer adjusted contracting we should consider with payers heading into the launch of Omnipod 5? I mean, do you plan to have all that in place heading into 2021? Is that a dynamic you\u2019d expect to work through once you get this system approved? Really I just wonder how that paradynamic plays into some of the access points talk to on a couple of questions so far. Shacey Petrovic : Yes. So I think we\u2019re in a good spot because what this is, is an amendment to existing contracts, as opposed to what we had to accomplish with DASH, where we had to go build the relationships and then go establish contracts and pricing in terms with all of our payers. So we are way ahead of the game on that front. But we do plan to use the data to be able to establish a reimbursement with our payers. And so that data will hopefully be available shortly after, our patients or our participants complete the trial in Q4. And I would imagine that the end of 2020, beginning of 2021, our teams are working very hard on establishing access for Omnipod 5. Jason Bednar : Okay. And then just actually within that just one quick follow-up then. I mean, if it is as simple as an amendment, is that \u2013 would that amendment be the same or would it be a simple amendment, if you\u2019re seeking a price premium? Or is that an amendment just to provide access? Shacey Petrovic : No, Jayson, you\u2019re hitting on a really important point and this is the debate that\u2019s going on internally currently. We know that the performance of Omnipod 5 demands a premium. It\u2019s a product that delivers pretty remarkable outcomes for users. What we\u2019re going to be weighing that against and where there\u2019s a lot of analysis going on right now is, the trade off there is just how quickly we can establish access. And so that\u2019s the work that\u2019s underway with the teams right now, and we have not yet shared. And I\u2019m not even sure we\u2019ve landed completely, but shared where we plan to be with a premium. But the access will happen very quickly or much more quickly, if we don\u2019t have a premium or we have a minimal premium, and it will take a much slower ramp if we decide to attach a premium to it. So that\u2019s the rub. Operator : Thank you. And we have time for one last question. This question comes from Matt Taylor of UBS. Your line is now open. Matt Taylor : Thanks for taking the question. Since nobody focused on it, I wanted to ask about drug delivery, since it was a lot higher and you had forecast, and I mean, I think it makes sense during COVID that you want to have more at-home delivery of these drugs. Can you comment on whether you think that\u2019s going to be a lasting trend? I know you don\u2019t have the full forecast past few quarters. But do you think that this could change the trajectory of that business or you\u2019re focused on it? Shacey Petrovic : Thanks, Matt for the question, I really \u2013 I think it\u2019s durable to the extent that the pandemic is durable. So I don\u2019t know that it changes the trajectory significantly, it\u2019s really great to see the power of the pod in drug delivery. But it\u2019s probably not an area that we see changing dramatically. And I maintain that, right now it\u2019s very difficult to see any opportunities that are more attractive than the massive growing market that is before us in diabetes. We see just the CGM and technology adoption is at this inflection point and we\u2019re on the cusp of launching Omnipod 5, and so that\u2019s where we\u2019re focused. Matt Taylor : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Shacey Petrovic : Thanks, Matt. Operator : Thank you. And this does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back to Shacey Petrovic. Shacey Petrovic : Great. Thank you. Despite the continuing effects of the pandemic Insulet delivered strong operational and financial performance, and our team continues to demonstrate an ability to adapt quickly to challenges and execute on behalf of our customers, our shareholders and our stakeholders. So to all of our employees, I want to thank you for your relentless hard work and dedication. I\u2019m incredibly proud of how we\u2019ve rallied together to support one another and to ensure we continue to advance our mission. Thank you all for joining us today and we look forward to providing updates on our progress throughout the remainder of the year. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Insulet Corporation Third Quarter of 2020 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations. Deborah Gordon : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Insulet's third quarter 2020 earnings call. With me today are Shacey Petrovic, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Wayde McMillan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The replay of this call will be archived on our website and the press release discussing our third quarter 2020 results and fourth quarter and full year 2020 guidance is also available in the IR section of our website. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations. We ask that you please refer to the cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely, adjusted EBITDA and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth excluding the effect of foreign exchange. These measures aligned with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance and we believe that they are helpful to investors, analysts and other interested parties as a measure of our comparative operating performance from period to period. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis, and all revenue growth rates will be on a constant currency basis. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Shacey. Shacey Petrovic : Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I'll update you on our progress with our strategic imperatives, and then many reasons we are excited about the future. Wayde will discuss our financial results and outlook for the rest of this year, and then we'll open the call to your questions. We remain in challenging unprecedented times. The progress we've made despite this challenging environment, demonstrates the durability of our recurring revenue business model, OmniPod's differentiated form factor and the commitment and resilience of the Insulet team. Together, our team has cared for our users who need our support, advanced our innovation pipeline and delivered another remarkable quarter on all aspects of our business. We achieved third quarter revenue growth of 20%. Our U.S. and international OmniPod product lines, each achieved another record revenue quarter. New customer starts were stronger than expected, and we now expect to deliver our fifth consecutive year of 20% revenue growth despite the pandemic. We also expect to finish 2020 above our pre-COVID expectations at the start of the year. While delivering strong performance, we are also building a foundation to drive adoption in our enormous and growing market over the long-term. In just the markets we currently serve, there are approximately 10 million people living with insulin-dependent diabetes, who could benefit from improved quality of life and better outcomes with OmniPod. This market opportunity will grow significantly as we move into new geographies, expand awareness and access to our technologies and bring our game-changing consumer-oriented innovations to market. Our highest \u2013 our long-term growth will be supported by the manufacturing expertise required to produce the highest quality products, while increasing gross margins. We are investing in each of these areas to build enduring advantages that will enable us to improve the lives of people with diabetes for many years to come. I'll start with expanding access and awareness. We are establishing market access so OmniPod is easily available regardless of age, type of diabetes or payer. Our access through the U.S. pharmacy channel offers customers an unusually simple onboarding experience. Benefit checks are swift. Co-pays are low and don't come with a large one-time cost. And virtual training is quick and effective. While COVID-19 has presented challenges, it also has pushed us to embrace virtual training, which is now preferred by users and providers. We expect these newly developed capabilities to continue to provide value as we scale our business. Approximately 80% of our new customers in the third quarter were multiple daily injection users attracted to OmniPod's ease-of-use and unique form factor. Additionally, approximately one-third of our U.S. new customers were Type 2, up from last quarter. Fueling the success with MDI and Type 2 is OmniPod DASH. Since launched 18 months ago, awareness of OmniPod DASH's unparalleled simplicity has grown and we have built a broad pharmacy access in the United States. By the end of Q3, we had secured coverage for 65% to 70% of covered lives for OmniPod DASH. With OmniPod DASH in the pharmacy, MDI users no longer pay large upfront costs or get locked into a four-year contract to try an insulin pump. They can start on OmniPod with a free trial and no lock-in period. We are thrilled to be knocking down barriers and enabling OmniPod to bring improved quality of life and outcomes to more people with diabetes. In our progress on establishing broad market access through the pharmacy channel, the time was right to launch a small-scale direct-to-consumer advertising pilot. We launched the pilot in September and have been learning a ton. While we know our DTC is working to raise awareness, we are still monitoring key performance metrics, such as lead conversion rates and retention of DTC-generated customers. We know increased awareness is key to growing adoption, and we are delighted to be in such a strong position to invest and explore this area. While our world has been challenged with the pandemic, our team has not missed a beat in advancing our innovation pipeline. OmniPod 5 is the world's first tubeless wearable AID system and the only one fully controlled by a user's mobile phone. With OmniPod 5, we will give our customers freedom, simplicity and integration with personal consumer technology like no other system on the market today. Our automated insulin delivery platform is transformative technology with potential applications in a variety of segments. And our initial launch of OmniPod 5 for Type 1 diabetes users aged seven plus, marks our first step. We are excited about the impact it will make in the market and on the lives of people with diabetes. Over time, we will be investing in clinical studies to first explore and then prove OmniPod 5's utility in more market segments. We are thrilled to have recently completed our OmniPod 5 pivotal trial and remain on track to launch in the first half of this coming year. While our team prepares for FDA submission, virtually all of the trial participants have transitioned into a pivotal extension phase. They will remain on product and provide us with critical additional data to support OmniPod 5's value proposition with payers and with clinicians. This data will also help inform our future innovations beyond OmniPod 5. We are excited to share our clinical results. And given ATTD has been delayed, we are evaluating the best alternative to do so. Our OmniPod 5 pre-school pivotal study with two to six year olds is under way with all 80 participants on product. OmniPod ranks number one within this demographic, and we are delighted to have kicked off our pivotal study to make OmniPod 5 available down to age two. Our goal is to have the expanded indication by the end of 2021 for this young population and their caregivers. Additionally, following the FDA's acceptance of our Type 2 clinical study protocol, in September, we began enrollment. This feasibility study will include 30 to 40 participants, each wearing OmniPod 5 for approximately two months. As we learn more from our growing Type 2 user base, we know there is a large market for an appropriate Type 2 AID system. We are confident an OmniPod AID system will provide great value for the Type 2 population, and we expect our early clinical work will result in important learnings. OmniPod's form factor, our pay-as-you-go model in the pharmacy and our experience developing exceptionally simple products position us uniquely to grow pod use month Type 2 users. While we prepare for OmniPod 5's submission and commercial launch, we are also making progress on our future products. We are advancing our collaborations with Dexcom and Abbott who are rapidly and meaningfully raising awareness of diabetes technology among Type 1 and Type 2 users. CGM is helping users recognize that they need better insulin delivery solutions. And CGM adoption is paving the way for generations of OmniPod products to meet these needs. In addition to integration with our next generation sensors, we have exciting work under way to make OmniPod 5 compatible with iOS. And we continue to advance our algorithm to expand our lead in simplicity and ease-of-use. Now, turning to our progress in our international markets. We have seen a gradual recovery in our European markets. And in September, we announced the full commercial rollout of OmniPod DASH. Our teams have done a remarkable job preparing our markets to support this launch, and our customers are loving the product. Now 100% of our new customers in Europe start on OmniPod DASH. In September, we announced the start of our geographic expansion efforts, and we are on track to enter five new markets by early 2021. We're taking a deliberate approach to our international expansion as we build our capabilities in each market and leverage our existing teams and strong distributor relationships. While it will take time to broaden our presence, over the longer term, our expanded global footprint will significantly increase our total addressable market. Finally, turning to operational excellence. In order to meet the growing demand for OmniPod, we are increasing capacity in both the United States and China. We are making considerable progress with the ramp of our first two highly automated U.S. manufacturing lines. And we are nearing completion of our third line installation, which we expect will produce sellable product next year. We have also made an investment in another contract manufacturer in China, allowing us to leverage our local supplier base and highly experienced team to quickly scale. These investments strengthen our global manufacturing and supply chain operations and ensure that over the long-term we have the capacity and redundancy to meet increased global demand for our products. In summary, the world remains challenged with the impact of the global pandemic. However, the compelling benefits of OmniPod, the uniqueness and durability of our recurring revenue model and the outstanding execution of our team provide significant insulation for Insulet. We delivered strong financial and operational performance, and we are taking the appropriate steps to expand our innovation pipeline, grow our addressable markets and enhance our global manufacturing capabilities. Our team is focused on finishing the year strong and sustaining our momentum as we move toward launch of OmniPod 5 in the first half of 2021. And most importantly, we remain focused on improving the lives of people living with diabetes. I will now turn the call over to Wayde. Wayde McMillan : Thanks, Shacey. Our third quarter marked a continuation of our strong performance, as we once again delivered double-digit revenue growth, including record quarterly revenue for our diabetes product lines. We've maintained a solid track record of performance, largely due to our loyal customers and the commitment and execution of our global Insulet team. We are steadily advancing our strategic imperatives and delivering on our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes. Turning to the third quarter financial results. We delivered 20% revenue growth ahead of our expectations and $9 million above our guidance range. Total OmniPod growth was 18%, which was the major driver of our outperformance at $6 million above our guidance range. Drug delivery revenue also finished ahead of our expectations with growth of 47%, which was $3 million above our guidance range. In our total OmniPod business, the pandemic was a smaller headwind than expected. It negatively impacted global new customer starts in both the second and third quarters. This creates a compounding impact on our revenue, which we began to see in the third quarter and we'll continue to see an impact into the fourth quarter and first half of 2021. Despite this headwind and as a result of our year-to-date strong results and continued execution, we now expect full year 2020 total OmniPod revenue growth to exceed our start of the year pre-COVID expectations. In Q3, we exceeded our guidance for new customer starts. We expect that the pandemic would lower our beginning of the year expectations by 30% to 50%. Our results were favorable in both the U.S. and international regions with the combined impact slightly less than 30%. Additionally, both the U.S. and international had significant sequential improvements resulting in approximately half of the impact in Q3 versus Q2. Attrition and utilization for total OmniPod were stable sequentially. Looking by product line, U.S. OmniPod revenue grew 21%, exceeding our guidance range of 14% to 16%. Q3 revenue included a headwind of an approximate 4 million decrease in distributor channel inventory levels, partially offsetting estimated channel inventory built in the first half of the year, mainly due to the pandemic. Our strong growth was driven by further expansion of our customer base, increased OmniPod DASH adoption and the mix benefit from the shift to the pharmacy channel, including the premium on DASH where we provide the PDM to customers at no charge. In the third quarter, OmniPod DASH drove approximately 65% of our U.S. new customer starts. And we grew volume through the pharmacy channel to over 30% of our total U.S. volume. International OmniPod revenue grew 12% compared to our guidance range of 9% to 11%, primarily due to better than expected new customer starts. Channel inventory growth in the quarter of an estimated 4 million to 5 million was primarily driven by stocking shipments of OmniPod DASH and with similar to the amount of estimated increased distributor orders we experienced in Q3 2019. Drug delivery revenue increased 47% compared to our guidance range of 23% to 28%. Similar to Q2, the overachievement was due to our partners' increased forecast related to the current environment. Turning to gross margin. We delivered 65%, up 80 basis points, exceeding our expectations. Key drivers of our gross margin expansion included improving performance of our U.S. manufacturing as we ramp our newly implemented automated lines as well as the favorable revenue mix from the shift to higher volume through the pharmacy channel. Also contributing was favorable product line mix. While positive foreign exchange was a 60 basis point tailwind, it was offset by a 60 basis point headwind from one-time COVID-related costs of $1.1 million. Operating expenses in the third quarter were largely in line with our expectations on a dollar basis and slightly lower as a percentage of revenue given our strong top-line performance. Expenses increased on a dollar basis, primarily due to the marketing costs as well as R&D and clinical spend for OmniPod 5. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue was 18.1% in the third quarter, up from 15.4% in the prior year. Our profitability improvement benefited from operations with improved gross margins and operating expense leverage and the change in other income. Turning to cash and liquidity. We remain in a strong position with our earliest debt maturing in 2024 and low cash interest expense. We ended the third quarter with $897 million in cash and investments. Subsequent to Q3, we raised an additional $130 million of cash related to building and equipment financings as these type of arrangements helped to reduce our overall cost of capital. The additional cash further strengthens our position and allows us to continue to invest in our strategic imperatives. Our investments are primarily to scale manufacturing and supply chain operations capacity as well as for R&D programs, global commercial and sales force expansion and international product and geographic expansion. We are uniquely positioned to drive rapid growth by serving a large and underpenetrated market, and our strong cash position provides us with capital to further strengthen our foundation for long-term sustainable growth. Now turning to our revised outlook for 2020. As a result of third quarter revenue that exceeded expectations, we are raising our total company full year 2020 revenue guidance to growth of 20% to 21%, up from our previous expectations of 17% to 19% and above our beginning of year estimate. This includes raising total OmniPod revenue to a range of 21% to 22%. Our total OmniPod growth rates are now back in line with our original guidance set at the start of the year pre-COVID, which is a testament to the resilience of our durable annuity model and the execution of our Insulet team. By product line, for U.S. OmniPod, we are raising our expected revenue growth to 23% to 24%. And for international OmniPod, we are raising our expectations to 18% to 19%. Although COVID to create uncertainties and it is difficult to predict the progression of the pandemic or the probability of a resurgence, we now expect the global new customer starts for the full year of 2020 will improve to approximately 75% of our beginning of the year estimate. Despite the challenging environment, our global diabetes business remains well positioned to generate strong growth this year as well as in 2021 and beyond. Lastly, for drug delivery, we are updating our expected revenue growth to 4% to 6%, resulting from the increased forecast from our business partner. Turning to the rest of the P&L. As a result of our outperformance in the third quarter and stronger revenue outlook, we are raising our full year 2020 gross margin guidance to approximately 64%, up from approximately 63%. This includes the headwind of $9 million to $10 million or approximately 100 basis points of estimated one-time costs related to COVID safety and mitigation efforts versus our prior guide of $7 million to $10 million. We now expect 2020 capital expenditures will be below prior year levels due to projects coming in favorable to estimated spend and due to timing. Our long-term financial strategy and capital deployment plans remain unchanged. And we therefore expect capital expenditures to grow again next year to support scaling manufacturing and supply chain operations capacity as well as advancements in our innovation pipeline and commercial and international expansion. For full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA, as a percentage of revenue, we continue to expect to come in at the low end of our previously stated 13% to 17% range. Turning to fourth quarter 2020 guidance. We now expect total company revenue growth of 7% to 11%. This includes total OmniPod revenue growth of 10% to 14%, which as a reminder, reflects the compounding of lower new customer starts from the prior two quarters related to the pandemic. By product line, we expect U.S. and international OmniPod revenue each to grow 10% to 14% and drug delivery to decline 17% to 23%. In terms of new customers, we now expect global new customer starts to improve in the fourth quarter to a range of 15% to 25%, less than our beginning of the year expectations. This compares to the 25% impact we guided to on our Q1 and Q2 calls. In conclusion, we achieved strong growth year-to-date despite the impact from the global pandemic. This speaks to the power of our differentiated market position through product innovation and durable recurring revenue model. Our innovation pipeline is strong and our financial position is sound. We are focused on finishing the year strong and building momentum as we enter 2021. Assuming market conditions stabilize next year, we remain on track to deliver our 2021 targets of $1 billion in revenue, gross margin in the range of 67% to 70% and operating income as a percentage of revenue at the low end of mid-teens. With that, we'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Please go ahead. Brandon Vazquez : Hi, everyone. This is Brandon on for Margaret. Thanks for taking the question. First if I could just focus on the Q4 guide. Can you just talk about what kind of maybe COVID headwinds are baked into that? We've obviously seen a lot of resurgence of COVID globally. So does that kind of bake in things getting worse or does it kind of assume that things stay the same as we go through the fourth quarter? Wayde McMillan : Hey, Brandon. It's Wayde. I can start with that one. And it's a good place to start actually because this is obviously a major driver in the business today, and it's really different in the U.S. and international, as you said. So if we talk about the U.S. first, we've been performing quite well in the U.S. And new customer starts have been below our beginning of year expectations in Q2 and Q3, but we've been building momentum in the business, and Q4 is going to be pretty close to Q4 in the prior year. And just a reminder, Q4 in the prior year was our all-time highest new customer starts. And so we get a really tough comp in Q4. But in the U.S., the momentum has been building. We've got a lot of things driving that momentum. DASH is still a primary driver for us. The move into Type 2 is still early. The pharmacy model with pay-as-you-go is working well. We've made investments in our commercial business and expanding the sales force. And then our teams have done a great job ramping the virtual training. So there's just a lot of positives that are somewhat offsetting those headwinds from new customer starts. And as a result, we still got double-digit growth in our guide. And so for the U.S., it's going to be pretty close. If we can get to the high end of our guide or even above, then new customer starts are going to be pretty strong for us in Q4. From an international standpoint, it's a different story. The recovery has been slower. And as you mentioned, we've seen recently a few countries going more back into a lockdown. And so in speaking with our field teams there, they do anticipate it's going to be more challenging. But what's different than Q2 when this really caught everybody by surprise is our teams are much more effective now, it's still staying in contact with their customers, finding ways to connect with them, and DASH is a great \u2013 it's just great timing for us to be launching DASH because it gives our teams an opportunity to still get those meetings with physicians and with customers. And so we do think that new customer starts will continue to be more of a headwind above or at the high end of this range for us, but our teams are doing a better job, and there is lots of momentum. I mentioned, DASH newly launched internationally, but we've made sales force expansion there and we're also expanding into new countries. And so there is a lot of momentum building in behind this pandemic. And so I think we're going to continue to do that. But at the end of the day, the anticipated headwinds to the extent we can, I mean, it's obviously very difficult to predict how much impact the pandemic will have, but we've built the assumption into the high end and low end of our guidance ranges. And just depending on how impactful it is, it should land us in the range. If we see something like Q2 again, that was pretty extreme, and I think that would be something that would probably push us out of the range. Brandon Vazquez : Great. That's really helpful color. And then the last one for me. As \u2013 I appreciate it's probably too early to get into specific numbers for 2021, but maybe it might be helpful if you just kind of \u2013 how are you thinking about 2021 internally about what kind of COVID catalyst, whether it'd be a vaccine, whether a widespread available vaccine, what kinds of catalysts are you looking forward to kind of get back to normal pre-COVID levels? And on the same token, does COVID potentially slow the rollout of OmniPod 5 given that may be needs a little bit more hands on training given it's a closed loop or perhaps that's an incorrect assumption? Thanks. Shacey Petrovic : Sure. Thanks, Brendan, for the question. And I think what we had said at the beginning of this year is that we did expect to see continued improvement throughout the year and then we were hoping for normalization in 2021. And I don't want to sort of predict what's going to happen in 2021, but I think it's great to see where we are now predicting to close this year, because it means we're ahead of what we expected in terms of the potential impact of COVID. And regardless of what happens with the vaccine and the macro environment, our teams are getting great at managing and making an impact in this environment, and that's because of some of the things that Wayde just mentioned, our virtual training tools and various capabilities that we've built. In terms of OmniPod 5, that is a product that we have spent so much design work and thinking and organizational focus on simplicity and ensuring that everything from the onboarding experience through to the use experience of the system is simple. And it is designed to be a product that \u2013 and it's simple enough that MDI users and kids can easily get on to and be successful with. So I don't anticipate that COVID is going to slow us down. There is just incredible enthusiasm in the market and internally with all of us to get that product on to the market, and we're going to make that happen regardless of what's happening in the macro environment. Thank you. Brandon Vazquez : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Patrick Allen : Good afternoon, everyone. This is Patrick on for Matt. Thank you. Thank you so much for taking the questions. I just wanted to follow-up just a little bit on the COVID environment. You implemented your financial assistance program in April, can you give us a sense for the participation within that program? And I know it runs till December of this year, but as some people may have roll off their COBRA insurance plan, do you envision this dynamic to further the utilization of that program or any color there would be really appreciated? Thank you. Shacey Petrovic : Sure, Patrick. I'll ask Wayde to give a little bit more color on utilization of the program. But at a high level, I'll say that it's something that I think we as a company are very proud of and that we were out front and able to offer this assistance to our users. This is very much about ensuring that while COVID is negatively impacting in an outsized fashion our partners that they can remain on product. And so we're proud of the program and our intent is to \u2013 we were committed through the end of this year. If we feel like that need may persist, then we will certainly evaluate continuing the program. Wayde McMillan : And on the numbers, Patrick, they have been quite small actually. I think you mentioned COBRA, but there has been many other options for people including Medicaid in the states or alternative insurance in the household. So we haven't seen that many people on the program. But having said that, we've always had financial assistance program and we've had several \u2013 quite a few people on that over the years. And so this is really an enhancement to that program, and we haven't met the number of people that we had on our original program yet. So it's not like it's been a significant pick-up at this point. But as Shacey said, we're really happy to have it in place. If we have current customers that can't afford the product given the current situation they're in, we're more than happy to backstop them and help them continue with their therapy until they can access it through normal channels again. Patrick Allen : That's really helpful color, guys. Thank you for that. And my quick follow-up. I'd love to hear more about the DTC campaign efforts that you're making. I know you started a limited national DTC that seems to be doing well, and you'll have more KPIs to kind of gauge how successful that program is. But how should we think about the DTC efforts into next year with some of the COVID impacts still kind of percolating and OmniPod 5 coming out? Like, how are you thinking about the broader rollout for that DTC campaign as you round the corner of 2020 into 2021? And thanks for taking the questions again. Shacey Petrovic : Sure. Patrick, it's funny, you're asking the questions that we're asking ourselves internally. I mean, one of the reasons why we wanted to do DTC this year before launching OmniPod 5 is that we really wanted to learn about the impact, learn about the messaging that's most effective, the channels that are most effective. We've been expanding our DTC over the last couple of years through digital channels, but this is the first time that we've really stuck our toe into television. And it's clear from the early numbers that we've made an impact on awareness. It certainly is driving increased awareness. And what we are looking at now is just how does that awareness convert into actual customers over what period of time and to what degree. And then are those customers \u2013 because remember, we have eliminated all barriers to getting on the product. Patient can get on to OmniPod in the pharmacy without any upfront cost and basically with a free trial. And so we want to make sure that those patients stay on the product to the extent that our customer base does. So those are the things that we're evaluating before we determine to what extent we increase our investment in DTC in 2021. And our plan is to give a bit more color on the next call when we're bringing and we should have learned more by then and have a better point of view in terms of expanding. But I think what's exciting is that now that we have the position that we have in the pharmacy channel, we actually have the scale and the position to kind of support increased demand. And so that is really exciting to us in the DME channel, getting patients through the process and onto the product is a bit more cumbersome. And for patients to be able to walk into the pharmacy, get the product, have no upfront cost and have that sort of easy onboarding experience, is the right time to start to learn more about DTC. And we're encouraged and stay tuned. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Robbie Marcus : Great. Congrats on a really good quarter. I have two questions. First Shacey I was hoping you could give us your thoughts on the status of new patients and where they're coming from? I'm sure a lot of it is DASH, I'm sure a lot of it's the form factor, the lower out of pocket. But if you think about when you have Horizon 5, one of your competitors with an integrated solution is outpacing in terms of new patient growth and a lot of it has to do with the AID solution. So how should we think about as we set our models, the benefit from DASH, but also the benefit that's coming once you have a competitive AID solution? Shacey Petrovic : Yes, I think those are great questions and I think really highlight why we're so excited about OmniPod 5. You see the growth that we're driving, Wayde said, in Q4, in the U.S., we could be back to a, all-time record quarter at the high end of our guidance for new patients. So we're seeing a great recovery. That recovery is being driven as it\u2019s, frankly always has been off of OmniPod\u2019s form factor. 80% of new users are coming from MDI. So we continue to grow the overall market and that's being driven by OmniPod factor by pharmacy access in both Type 1 and Type 2 MDI users. That is a population that is just very attracted to DASH and its simplicity. I think we'll continue to see that segment adopt OmniPod based on its form factor and based on the out-of-pocket economics. Actually in the pharmacy channel, the vast majority of our patients are accessing OmniPod for less than a $50 co-pay. So it's very economic. It's very attractive in terms of form factor and the access channel and so those are driving demand today. I think what you are highlighting is why we \u2013 people are so excited about OmniPod 5 is that you can really see the power of integration with the Dexcom sensor and AID. And up until the next few months when we get, or the next several months, when we get OmniPod 5 out into the market, patients have had to choose between what we know is a preferred form and integration with the Dexcom sensor. And obviously, in the first half of 2021, they'll no longer have to choose. And so I'm not going to make predictions on exactly how that's going to change our trends. I think we certainly expect it to be an accelerator. And I think the question is what changes in terms of MDI users coming on to the product, or do we see more pump users coming onto the product, because remember they can adopt OmniPod 5 without any cost and without a four-year lock-in period. So we're really excited to basically check every box that patients are looking for in terms of an insulin delivery system and an AID system in particular with OmniPod 5. Robbie Marcus : Great. And maybe one for Wayde. Wayde you\u2019ve clearly demonstrated a conservative approach to guidance since you've come in as CFO. And particularly I'd say a very conservative stance to guidance during COVID-19. And I understand with good reason all the unpredictability, especially with cases starting to rise again. I think I asked you this last question and you far out ceded your guidance range. But I'm going to ask you again on this call, can you help us understand some of the underlying metrics that get you to a range that I would say people would say seems fairly conservative, large destocking that we should think about? Are you willing to give us maybe what volume versus mixed price was in third quarter? And is that going to be materially different in fourth quarter? Just trying to get a sense of some of the underlying trends here. And how much of it is conservatism versus just a downward move in the numbers. Thanks. Wayde McMillan : Hey, Robbie. First of all, glad you brought up guidance. We're very happy that we chose to issue guidance back in Q2 at the front end of this pandemic. It was a big decision. But when we looked at the recurring revenue model that we're in and how that really defends against a one quarter impact, like the pandemic happened in Q2, and that we were going to see a potential new customer starts impacting us for a few quarters, it compounds. And so that it's really math and it's our new customer starts over a few quarters, they compound. Q4 ends up with three quarters, including Q2, which was the lowest in it. So that's why we have a bigger headwind in new customer starts in Q4 than we've seen. The comment on conservatism, I mean, I'll take that every time because we held guidance and we did it because we wanted to make sure people understood our business model and that we could articulate our business by putting the ground and adding additional metrics so we could talk to it. The major drivers of our business, like you said, are mostly volume. And our business is very much a volume business now. As we sell through the pharmacy, we start to get into more and more distribution channels. There will be other ways for people to access our product over time. So it definitely becomes a volume business. And so for us mix plays an important component today, moves as we move customers from our traditional DME and direct channels into the pharmacy. And the premium that we get for the pay-as-you-go model, because we're given the PDM for no charge, those are dynamics today. But they are far away by the volume increases in the business. Robbie Marcus : Got it. Appreciate it. And just one very quick clarification. Are there any major conferences to present the pivotal data now that ATTD has been under, should we expect it in the label? Thanks. Shacey Petrovic : Yes, thanks Robbie. We are evaluating that. We had a great forum with ATTD and our clinical investigators being invited to share the data. But obviously we were just recently notified that it's been delayed till May. So we're looking to see other appropriate forums for us to get it out there. And there's just a lot of moving pieces. Obviously, the most important thing is that we get FDA clearance and get to launch top of next year. So we don't want to get the data out ahead of that and maybe ruffle feathers at the FDA. So we're looking at our options and we certainly understand, and we're enthusiastic to get it out there as soon as possible. But I don't have specifics to provide today. Operator : Thank you. Actually our next question comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David Lewis : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions here. Wayde, I wonder if next year is a year when we think about OmniPod 5 launching certain margin considerations that you've talked about fair amount this year, and then of course COVID impacting new patients starts, which could sort of bleed into early part of 2021. Is there anything sort of high level we should be thinking about as we think about the models next year in terms of new patients starts, margins, mix of business any considerations at all that could be helpful as we think about 2021 modeling? Wayde McMillan : Yes, I think, you just checked off the major ones, David. And let's start with COVID because this is one of the ones that's harder to predict for us, we've got this progression, we've seen a significant improvement from Q2 into Q3. We're expecting a pretty big step up in the U.S. At the high end of our guide, we're only a few percentage points off our beginning of your estimate and that was a pretty strong estimate. So we're anticipating pretty strong recovery in the U.S. If we get there, then it really is about how does COVID hit us in 2021. And that's the unknown. And we'll obviously know more after we get through Q4 and we're set up to give our 2021 guide. We always give our guide at our Q4 call. And so, we'll have a much better feel, I think, for what at least the early part of 2021 will look like in the U.S. Outside the U.S. international, we're seeing more and more lockdowns already here in the quarter. And so that's \u2013 we're so far we feel comfortable, we'll be in the range that we've provided for international, but again, next year it makes it a much more challenging thing. So, with, COVID, obviously that's a question mark. For the other drivers that you mentioned OmniPod 5, that one comes \u2013 first half of the year will be our limited market release and so we won't see a material impact until the second half of the year. So from a modeling standpoint, to your question, David, I would think about OmniPod 5, starting to ramp in the second half of the year. Gross margins, we were very happy to report just under 65. And I think we can think about the same for Q4, and that really sets us up for the 67 to 70 next year. We do have a lot of programs going. We announced recently that we've stood up another third party manufacturing plant in China. And so we're working our first two lines there to get sellable product. And so we've got a lot of things happening inside of that gross margin number, but they are all designed to get us set up so that we can increase capacity on a short-term basis if we need to. And at the same time we're ramping up the U.S. So I think we're squarely in that 67% to 70% range for next year. Depending on the volume and depending on how fast we ramp, we could be at the low end, but we could just as easily be at the high end. And so I think from a modeling standpoint gross margin is just right in that 67% to 70% range. From a mix standpoint, we'll continue to see the mix benefit less from the pharmacy channel. We're not done moving customers from the DME and direct side of the business, into the pharmacy and ramping up DASH. The one thing that's still a question mark for us there is, what we'll be pricing OmniPod 5 at and whether we'll have premium price or price parity there? So there's a few open questions, Dave, that we'll look to clarify when we get to our earnings \u2013 or pardon me, our guidance in our Q4 call. David Lewis : Okay. Super helpful. Just one more question for Shacey. So Wayde the third quarter, momentum slowdown in the U.S. I'm sort of assuming, because you guided to momentum slowed in the fourth quarter that just reflects probably the peak COVID new patients start impacting the third quarter, and there's kind of no change in underlying U.S. fundamentals. And then just for Shacey, as I think about OmniPod 5 next year and some of the different things you've talked about these last couple of calls, you always talk about MDI, you've talked about Type 1 as well. As you think about the impact of OmniPod 5 in the market next year, is it mounted for you Type 1 conversions, Type 1 share, which has not been necessarily a significant driver of the business, what do you think it actually accelerates, the MDI conversion part of the business? I'm just kind of curious, which is the most, or the more underappreciated opportunity between the two? Thanks so much. Wayde McMillan : Sure. So I can start then on the sequential growth that you mentioned, David and you're right, you can see it in our growth rates. Q2 is the problem quarter. I mean, that was a quarter where we had significantly lower new customer starts and we start to live with that for four quarters. And that's the big one that we will annualize out of the business in Q1 next year. And adding new customer starts from Q2 into three and four. So, I think four obviously has three quarters of compounded impact to it and that's factored into our guidance. But that's what I wanted to just share and give perspective on all the momentum we have building inside the business, because there's so much things happening. And really our goal here is to come out of the other side of the pandemic with as much momentum as we can around our new product innovations, around our business model strategies with Type 2 and the pharmacy, as well as the investments we've made in the salesforce and the commercial business including virtual training, as well as Shacey mentioned the end to end customer process. And so there's just so many good things that this compounding new customer start is offsetting for us. And so it's really our job to build the momentum here. Come out the other side stronger. Is Q4 going to be the trough? I don't know yet we have to see what the pandemic impact is in Q4 and then what Q1 looks like. But we really don't annualize out that tough Q2 until we get to Q1 next year. Shacey Petrovic : And David, on your question on OmniPod 5, I think, it's a great question. And one we're looking forward to sort of seeing the answer in, in 2021. I guess I get most excited about the MDI users that are converting. Because if you think about what's happening today, nobody chooses, at least our data would indicate that nobody chooses a tubed pump because it has tubes. They choose it over OmniPod when they do, because it has a Dexcom integration. And so when we check that box and we obviously believe OmniPod 5 will be significantly differentiated, can be easier to use. And we think about key features like phone control, like constant access to data and all the other things that I've spoken about. When we check that box, should get a much larger \u2013 plus already today we get a very large percent of MDI conversions we should get a much larger one. So that to me is probably the biggest opportunity. Because if you think about the capital equipment model, some of those folks, most of those folks are locked into a four-year contract. And so 25% of them will come up. And I think it'll be interesting to see in that population, what happens in terms of adoption for OmniPod 5. But that's an area where we\u2019re a little less familiar with because we get less patients from that area today. What we know for sure is that MDI users are going to be very, very attracted to OmniPod 5. And when we check the box of integration and automation with Dexcom, that's going to be a very differentiated and appealing product. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Larry Biegelsen : Thanks guys. Thanks for taking the question. One on international, one on, of course OmniPod 5. So in the past, I think, you guys have talked about international growth being in the high teens, low 20% range. Is that still intact? Which new markets are you planning to launch it in 2021? I heard five new markets in the prepared remarks. How far behind is OmniPod 5, outside the U.S. compared to the U.S.? And I have one follow-up Shacey Petrovic : Great. Maybe I'll ask Wayde to give a little bit of insight into the overall expectations for international growth. But there's nothing fundamental in the business that would change our long-term expectations for that business. It's just simply that we're in the midst of a pandemic and that there's been a slower recovery, in particularly Europe, than other parts of the world and particularly in the United States. So we remain very bullish on our expansion strategy over the long-term. And it's why I mentioned in my remarks that we're really starting in earnest our expansion in early 2021. And over time, this adds significant addressable market to us over the coming years. We didn't give the five markets. So we'll lay those out for you as we enter into them. We did get one checked off the box this quarter in Belgium. So actually one of the best entered. And we will let you know as we enter these markets, that those launches have occurred. Larry Biegelsen : Thank you. Shacey Petrovic : And then I \u2013 sorry had also asked Larry about OmniPod 5 in international. We haven't given a timeline on that yet. Just to let everybody know that that work is underway and we are fully committed to bringing OmniPod 5, to our European markets and to all of our international markets. Larry Biegelsen : Thank you. And on OmniPod 5, do you guys typically announce have filed or submitted something like that? And is there any reason why the pivotal OmniPod 5 data would look much different from the pre-pivotal data we saw at ADA this year? For example, larger number of centers, anything that we should be aware of that would make that data, the pivotal data look meaningfully different from the pre-pivotal data that we should be aware of? Thanks for taking the questions. Shacey Petrovic : Sure, thanks Larry. And we don't \u2013 our practice to notify or become public when we submit, we simply share the news when we're cleared. So that's our general practice. In terms of the data, I really don't have much insight to offer there. We don't want to preview it. Obviously the pre pivotal data looked very, very strong and we are very excited to get the OmniPod pivotal data out there, but I don't want to give insight into just how it compares at this point. Larry Biegelsen : Understood. Thank you. Shacey Petrovic : Thanks Larry. Operator : Yes, our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Baird. Please go ahead. Jeff Johnson : Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Maybe just a couple of clarifying questions. Wayde you mentioned OmniPod 5 pricing and thoughts on a premium potentially for next year. I thought that was kind of settled at this point that you probably were going to go after access more than pricing just to try to get it out there faster and more broadly across the counts in that. So just, is there a region happening that maybe you could get a premium for all five or how to think about that? Wayde McMillan : Yes, it's still a question for us, Jeff. There's a lot of different opportunities for us across the U.S. in particular. But like you said, a major consideration for us is getting it sold to our customers as fast as possible. And we certainly take into consideration the current environment that we're in, other AID systems that are in the marketplace. And so now that there is a significant opportunity for us to get there faster. Having said that, even if we go at parity pricing there's a long process to work through and we've put the infrastructure in place, we've built up our access teams, we built up our wholesalers and distributors, and we've learned a lot through the ramp up of DASH. And so it really is still a question for us. Jeff it really just depends on how we want to approach the market. Lots of benefits obviously to price premium, but there are just as many benefits and a very compelling one from a customer standpoint, to get it into the hands of our current customers, and new customers. So yes, that one is still a jump off for us. Jeff Johnson : Okay, great. And just maybe the follow-up then is this cumulative math that we talked to a lot of investors about and it seems to confuse them at times and the way you guide to new patients starts relative to your pre-COVID expects. When I put all that in the blender, it does seem to create maybe a little confusion. Very simplistically in the 3Q when I take kind of all the data points you are providing, it seems to me your new patient starts in the U.S. were probably closed on par with what they were last year in the 3Q, which was a pretty good quarter, obviously 4Q 2019 was even stronger, but 3Q 2019, it seems like your U.S. new patient starts almost at parity with last year. And on an absolute basis, o-U.S. may be down marginally 5% or 10% year-over-year, but not dramatically down. Is that the fair way to be thinking about what they were on an absolute basis in the quarter itself? Wayde McMillan : Yes. And you\u2019re right, it is challenging. And I'll just highlight again, this is one of the reasons why we wanted to provide guidance. So give us an opportunity to share more about it and to provide enough data points. And sounds like Jeff, you're close. What I would say is the U.S. was a little stronger headwind than you laid out there, but Q4 is going to be getting pretty close against a really tough comp in Q4. The U.S. business has been performing really well. And despite the headwind it's been on the low end of our stated new customer starts headwind. And then internationally, little higher again than the estimates you put out there. Those are a little lower than we're experiencing from our estimates. And we do expect international to persist more into Q4. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Please go ahead. Joanne Wuensch : Good evening and thank you for taking the questions. I\u2019ll just put them all up front. What is the size of the two to six-year-old population that you are looking to go after with that incremental study? And then I'm trying to get my head around how OmniPod 5 ramps next year. We've heard limited launch, we've heard full launch, but you've got a very successful DASH product that's already out there. And I'm trying to just \u2013 if you could walk us through any milestones or mile posts we should think about, thanks. Shacey Petrovic : Sure, Joanne. I don't have the total population of two to six-year-olds in the market. It's obviously a really important population for us. Not necessarily because of the size of the population, but because we know that when people adopt OmniPod they stay with us. So we've always been strategically focused on the young pediatric population. And it's also a population where OmniPod is heavily, heavily differentiated for a variety of reasons. It's a much easier technology to use on young active children. So we're excited about getting everybody enrolled in our clinical trial and getting that label expansion ideally before the end of next year. In terms of milestones for OmniPod 5, there is a tremendous amount of activity going on in the company, as we think about ramping towards the OmniPod launch. We have obviously the clinical data analysis, and presentation and publication of the data, so that will be a milestone as we move forward. We have IT and commercial work going on to look at establishing our easy onboarding systems for OmniPod 5. We have market access work. So obviously we will start to build reimbursement in the pharmacy channel for OmniPod 5. And then we have a ton of work going on in medical affairs, et cetera. And then of course we have the cross-functional team working on a submission, which is going to be somewhere around 30,000 to 40,000 pages. So almost every individual function in the company is touching the OmniPod 5 launch in some way. And so lots of milestones happening internally in terms of our commercial progress, our manufacturing progress and our clinical progress. The next thing that we\u2019ll really announce is probably the data and then the clearance of the system. And so those are the things to look for kind of publicly externally. And you mentioned, is it a limited market release, is it a full market release? We've always maintained that we will do a limited market release. It's a high stakes product for us. We know it's the most anticipated innovation in the pipeline of all diabetes products. And so we want to get it right and a limited market release as part of doing that. So when we launch in the first half of 2021, we will launch into a limited market release. How long that will be, I think, remains to be seen because it depends upon when we're meeting our end points and our objectives for a limited market release. And that will be based on market access, manufacturing ramp, and customer feedback. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you so much. Shacey Petrovic : Sure. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Blicker from Cowen. Please go ahead. Ryan Blicker : Hi, thanks for sticking me in. Maybe starting with the pharmacy channel transitions, you noted greater than 30% of U.S. volume is going to the pharmacy, which is similar to last quarter. 65% of new U.S. adds to the pharmacy. So the long-term outlook remains clear. But can you provide any additional color on why the pace of quarterly increases for total U.S. volume for the pharmacy has slowed a bit over the past couple quarters? And then looking to 2021, do you believe the OmniPod 5 launch will be a catalyst to convert a large portion of your existing install base to the pharmacy? Shacey Petrovic : Hey Ryan, maybe I'll let Wayde talk about the specific numbers in terms of the pharmacy channel, but I would say that momentum is very strong in the pharmacy channel, access continues to increase. And we do expect that OmniPod 5 should be a catalyst in terms of pharmacy conversions because it really is going to be a pharmacy product. And so that we are committed to, we are committed to the pay-as-you-go model. And we know there's a lot of demand building for the technology. Wayde McMillan : Right. You're correct. Our guidance is at greater than 30%. And just to clarify it is growing a couple of percentage points in our number. We just are keeping it rounded. So, as the quarters go quarter-to-quarter, we're probably not going to see major step-ups just given that our overall business grows as well. But as Shacey said, the majority of our new customers starts are on DASH. And DASH is primarily in the pharmacy. So we will continue to see the pharmacy volume grow over time. Ryan Blicker : That's great. And then if I could ask a two-part follow-up on the Type 2 opportunity, so you talked again about ramping CGM penetration in the Type 2 patient population, which clearly bodes well for pump penetration over time. Just wondering, thus far in 2020, have you seen any evidence of pump penetration increasing among that Type 2 patient population, or do you believe the increase in your Type 2 mix is being more driven by share gains of new patients? And then acknowledging it's really early, I'd be curious to know the patient mix at least generated by your DTP program and whether or not it's driving a disproportionate level of interest among Type 2s. Thank you. Shacey Petrovic : Thanks, Ryan. Yes, so in terms of overall pump utilization in Type 2s, it's still pretty low penetration, and there's just a massive opportunity to go get with Type 2s. We see CGM as sort of a beachhead, right. As CGM adoption happens, which is happening, is very maturely happening and in Type 1, but just really getting going in Type 2. And we see that as a trend, as you said, bodes well for pump adoption. Other pumps are challenged from an access perspective. So we are very fortunate to be in the pharmacy channel, providing the pay-as-you-go model. That's really what's driving access and availability of OmniPod to the Type 2 population. So we know we've got a really appealing product. We know that the technology adoption curve for CGM is helping to drive this. But we are in a unique position, in terms of our channel and in terms of our form factor and OmniPod\u2019s discretion and ease of use to be able to win in that market. And so I think we are winning, right now we're winning primarily with MDI conversions, not other pumps. And I would be surprised if other pumps are seeing the level of conversion that we're seeing in Type 2s. And we're testing a bunch of different messages in DTC. So we do have actually messaging that is geared towards the Type 2 population. Too early at this point to be able to give a color on that. But as I said, as we lay out our expectations for 2021, we'll be able to give insight into DTC and what we expect that that's going to drive for us. Ryan Blicker : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Travis Steed from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Travis Steed : Hi thanks for taking the questions. Just on the [indiscernible] study that you began [indiscernible] recently what you hope to gain from that, or [indiscernible] for OmniPod approval. Wayde McMillan : Why don\u2019t just ask some\u2026 Shacey Petrovic : Yes, Travis, I\u2019m sorry, you broke up there. So we didn't fully \u2013 you were a little garble, there were some interference. If you could repeat your question, that would be great. Travis Steed : Yes, sorry for that. The question was on the OmniPod 5 two feasibility studies, [indiscernible] you will gain from that if you need [indiscernible] approval for reimbursement coverage? Shacey Petrovic : Okay, great, OmniPod 5 Type 2 feasibility study. So that is the first step in terms of our clinical exploration for Type 2s on OmniPod 5. So you may remember we did feasibility studies for Type 1 with OmniPod 5 as well. This really is a step in the eventual label expansion. And it's an early step. So, we will get 30 to 40 users on the product. We will look to see, does the algorithm perform as we would expect it to, for this segment, or do we need to tweak the algorithm? Remember, when we did our early feasibility studies with OmniPod 5, in the Type 1 population, we did a lot of work on the algorithm, a tremendous amount of work on the algorithm to deliver the performance that we saw in the pre-pivotals. Remember we had best-in-class hypoglycemia, we had great time and range, particularly with kids that came from just a lot of tweaking of the algorithm. And so we may need to do the same thing in the Type 2 population that remains to be seen. Feasibility study will give us those learnings. It will then map out for us how much clinical work do we have. And then we'll be able to determine what's the path for label expansion. In terms of reimbursement, we're fortunate in the pharmacy channel there really isn't a distinction between the Type 1 and Type 2 user. And so with label expansion that should pave the way for access in the pharmacy channel for a Type 2. Travis Steed : Okay. That's great. And one quick question on \u2013 as you look through like the early last few weeks as cases spiked in certain geographies, is there anything to call out that's different in those geographies? Just kind of curious how well-prepared the doctors\u2019 offices and patients are now versus how they were earlier this year. Shacey Petrovic : Yes, I think it's a good point. And we mentioned in the U.S. everything is getting more efficient and more effective working in this environment. Of course, we've talked a lot about the virtual tools for training and support that we've rolled out we really have built a lot of confidence and preference among our clinicians and our patients for that pathway of training. And so even as certain areas experience more challenges with the pandemic, we're able to continue to bring new patients onto the product. And so in the U.S., as Wayde said, we're feeling pretty good, right. The high end of our guidance in Q4 would indicate that we're going to be at a record quarter in Q4. So that's great. Outside of the U.S., it's a more fragmented and more challenged environment right now. And we still see that our virtual tools and the capabilities that we've built are certainly helping to ensure that we can continue to bring patients on. But as we have the UK heading back into a shelter-in-place, France, those are a little bit more challenged environments for us. And France in particular is a large market for us. So it's not like Q2. We certainly still see progression in terms of improved new patients starts outside of the U.S. and even in these more challenged markets. But there definitely is a headwind there that doesn't exist in the United States. Travis Steed : Thank you. Operator : I show our last question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Briana Warschun : This is Briana on for Raj. Thank you for taking your questions. I was hoping you could provide some detail on the mix of COGS running through [indiscernible] versus sources from Flex in China? And then how does the new manufacturing contract in China play into that mix? And then just a quick follow-up on that would be, what is the gross margin upside potential as more manufacturing shifts in house, and as a shift in automated manufacturing in the U.S. the key driver to the high end of your long-term gross margin target of 70%, or is there other things going into that 70%? Wayde McMillan : Hi, Briana. Yes, you've actually touched on a couple of key drivers there. So the question was around mix COGS. And the key for us today is active manufacturing is a more expensive product because it's fairly low volumes on two lines in a plant that's designed for four automated lines. And a lot of the cost is fixed on the automated manufacturing lines. So today our production out of our Flex China facility is a lower cost than Acton. However, over time, it's designed that the automated manufacturing lines will be more efficient and get us this product. And that is as you mentioned, the single largest driver of improved gross margins for us over time. But in combination with that is scale. I think we are building significant, critical mass in the business here, as we accumulate more and more customers with our patch pump disposable design. And the investments that we've been making in manufacturing, both in the U.S. and in China, really build a critical mass of expertise, and know-how in how to do this. And as we scale and put volumes into it, those volumes help us drive gross margins significantly as well. And the new, third-party manufacturer in China is not an impact on our gross margins today. We've just got those two lines up and running and producing, not producing sellable product yet, but we do have them producing product. And so those will start to factor into our COGS, either later this year or in early 2021. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. As there are no further questions at this time, I would now like to turn the conference back to Shacey Petrovic. Shacey Petrovic : Thank you. In closing, I would like to acknowledge both National Diabetes Awareness Month and Insulet\u2019s 20th Anniversary since our company's founding. We've spent the last 20 years with a clear mission and improve the lives of people with diabetes. And over that time, we've brought advanced innovation to the diabetes community and helped people spend more time living their best life and let managing their chronic condition. So we're very proud of all we've done, and we're really excited about our innovations to come as we deliver on our mission. Thanks all. And have a great evening, Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host to Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations. Deborah Gordon : Thank you and good afternoon and thank you for joining us for Insulet\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings call. With me today are Shacey Petrovic, President and Chief Executive Officer and Wayde McMillan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Both the replay of this call and the press release discussing our 2020 results and 2021 guidance will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call maybe forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such statements. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. These measures align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance and we believe that they are helpful to investors, analysts and other interested parties as measures of our operating performance from period to period. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis with the exception of revenue growth rates, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis. With that, I will turn the call over to Shacey. Shacey Petrovic : Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. On today\u2019s call, I will discuss our key accomplishments and our strategic priorities. Wayde will share our 2020 financial results and introduce our 2021 guidance. And then we will open the call for your questions. The fourth quarter marked a strong finish to another very successful year for Insulet. In the face of extraordinary challenges, we executed our strategy, delivered consistently strong growth and advanced our key imperatives. This past year, more than any other, clearly demonstrated the loyalty of our customers, the durability of our pay-as-you-go model and the strong value proposition of our differentiated technology. What we have accomplished in 2020 is a clear indicator of the resiliency and strength of our people and our culture. Together, we embraced a new reality, while staying committed to our core mission we not only supported each other, but also our customers and the communities we serve. One of Insulet\u2019s greatest strengths is our mission-driven customer centric culture. This was particularly evident this past year as our team rose to the challenges and showed an incredible ability to learn, adapt and perform in an ambiguous and rapidly changing environment. We executed with an unwavering commitment to our customers and delivered another compelling year of growth. Our mission remains the same improve the lives of people with diabetes and every Insulet employee drives towards this goal with unmatched passion. In the face of COVID, we didn\u2019t miss a beat and we consistently advanced our innovation, commercial and operational initiatives. We entered 2021 with strong momentum with our Omnipod 5 commercial launch on track and expanding clinical and innovation pipeline and a growing global addressable market. In 2020, we delivered over 20% annual revenue growth for the fifth consecutive year, a remarkable achievement, given upended working conditions and market challenges. In fact, we finished 2020 ahead of our beginning of the year pre-COVID expectations. We achieved record annual and quarterly revenue for both our U.S. and international Omnipod product lines. We also completed the year with a fourth quarter record number of global new customers, driven by U.S. new customer starts that were higher than any quarter in Insulet\u2019s history. While we finished the year strong and overcame most of the pandemic\u2019s challenges, it certainly impacted our global new customer additions during 2020. As we look to 2021, this will serve as a slight headwind to revenue growth. Nevertheless, our financial performance has been impressive and our overall outlook remains strong. Let\u2019s turn to our strategic imperatives centered around expanding access and awareness, delivering consumer focused innovation, growing our global addressable market and driving operational excellence. I will start with access and awareness and what we are doing to deliver the best customer experience. Our primary goal is simple, breakdown existing access barriers for Omnipod. There are far too many people living with diabetes that don\u2019t have access to or are unaware of Omnipod\u2019s many benefits compared to other therapies. Outcomes are being limited because access traditionally has been too complicated and too costly. Omnipod offers a simple, discrete form factor and an easy-to-use product platform that is unmatched. We provide our customers broad, affordable access and a simpler customer experience while making it easier to prescribe for physicians. Our new customer starts, industry leading retention and customer loyalty are clear indicators of the value Omnipod delivers. We continue to attract approximately 80% of our new customers from multiple daily injections. And in the fourth quarter, between 35% and 40% of our new Omnipod customers were Type 2, up from Q3. Our current system, Omnipod DASH, not only marked our move to mobile technology and represents the platform for our next generations, it also is powering our success, attracting both MDI users and individuals with Type 1 and Type 2, as well as expanding pharmacy access. By the end of the fourth quarter, we had secured coverage for approximately 75% of U.S. covered lives for Omnipod DASH, up significantly from last quarter. Today, most of our new customers throughout the globe start on Omnipod DASH. While we remain focused on providing our customers easy access through our pay-as-you-go model and the U.S. pharmacy channel, we also continue to increase Omnipod awareness of the benefits we deliver to people living with diabetes. The diabetes market is dramatically underserved and increased Omnipod awareness is driving growth. Our recent direct-to-consumer advertising campaign has provided us with great insight. The reaction to our pilot and the early read of key leading indicators, have been positive. So we have decided to continue advertising to support our efforts. We look forward to updating you all on our progress throughout the year. Taking a step back, Omnipod adoption and retention have been incredibly strong despite not having a CGM integrated product in the marketplace. This year, that technological gap will not only be closed, it will be surpassed. We are thrilled to be on the verge of introducing our next evolution of consumer-focused innovation. We could not be more excited, and we know our customers and our future customers have been waiting for our transformative technology. Omnipod 5, our automated insulin delivery system in partnership with DexCom, is designed to deliver unmatched freedom for people living with diabetes and to greatly simplify insulin management and improve glucose control. We will be the first tubeless entirely wearable AID system with the algorithm on the pod. Other than a pod change every 3 days, there will be no need to disconnect or stop therapy. And the number one request from current and prospective customers is the ability to control the pod from a personal smartphone. Our system will be the first to provide full smartphone control. This means we can remove an entire component of the system, resulting in reduced burden and dramatically improved simplicity and ease of use. Our goal is to provide our customers much more and to ask them to do much less. Omnipod 5 will first launch with control from Android mobile phones and all customers will receive a backup personal diabetes manager with SIM technology. This ensures constant connectivity to data even when not near a Wi-Fi and this allows for real-time remote monitoring. With Omnipod 5, parents will always know how their children are doing on our system. We have heard from many about how much of a relief it is to have confidence in Omnipod 5 to control glucose and be able to periodically monitor their children in real-time. As a result, trial participants have told us that their families are finally sleeping and that they are better parents and spouses since starting on Omnipod 5. Omnipod 5 is disruptive technology that we believe will revolutionize the market and the lives of people living with insulin-dependent diabetes. We are on track for a limited commercial launch in the United States in the first half of this year with pharmacy access and our pay-as-you-go model. Unlike other therapies, Omnipod 5 customers will not have to pay upfront, nor will they have an upgrade fee or be locked into a 4-year contract. Anyone with coverage, even existing tube pump users can try Omnipod at any time for free with our 30 days of freedom trial. Omnipod 5 will be offered at price parity with Omnipod DASH in the U.S. while we know our Aid system commands a premium, our focus is on securing broad payer coverage and customer access. Like Omnipod DASH, the majority of Omnipod 5 customers will have a pharmacy monthly co-pay of under $50. Pricing Omnipod 5 at the same level as Omnipod DASH will drive affordable coverage, accelerated customer adoption and is consistent with our efforts to eliminate barriers and broaden access. We anticipate we will be in a limited launch period for the majority of this year. This gives us time to secure broad pharmacy coverage since Omnipod 5 will be available in only this channel. We are confident Omnipod 5 will be a game changer for people living with diabetes and believe the primary driver of a broader commercial rollout will be consumer access. We have invested ahead to build our manufacturing and supply chain operations and are more than prepared to meet market demand. As we gear up for our highly anticipated launch, we continue to build clinical evidence to support many applications of Omnipod 5 as we believe our technology can provide enormous value to broad groups of patients within multiple markets and settings. We, therefore, will continue to heavily invest clinically and have a robust road map, including our ongoing work to expand our indication to preschoolers, ages 2 to 6. We recently completed our preschool pivotal study, and we are compiling the data for submission to the FDA. The study had 80 young children on product, and we are delighted to share that 100% have completed the trial and 100% have elected to continue into an extension phase. This is a clear indication of the value that Omnipod 5 can deliver for these young children. And we continue to plan for an expanded indication by the end of this year. Also, enrollment for our Type 2 feasibility study continues. Upon that study\u2019s completion, we plan to conduct additional studies with the goal to further expand Omnipod 5\u2019s indications. Lastly, from a clinical perspective, we look forward to presenting our Omnipod 5 pivotal data at the Endo conference next month. If our pre pivotal data is any indication, it should demonstrate just how powerful Omnipod 5 is for improved outcomes and improved quality of life. We are incredibly excited about the upcoming launch of Omnipod 5 and a successful rollout remains our top priority. But we also continue to advance an innovation road map that extends well beyond our AID system. In fact, in 2020, we doubled the number of product development employees to support our robust road map, particularly in the areas of software development and data science. We are committed to investing in future innovations to deliver increased value to our customers for many years to come. We are working on innovation programs designed to drive unparalleled simplicity of our user interactions with our systems, improved outcomes through algorithm advancements, insights and value from our growing data sets and analytics and user choice of sensor and smartphone integrations. We are committed to integrating Omnipod 5 in our future generations with multiple CGM platforms, and are delighted to be partnering with DexCom and Abbott Libre in these efforts. Their CGM offerings are helping to drive increased Omnipod adoption in both the Type 1 and Type 2 segments. This is extremely beneficial as the global diabetes market remains critically underserved and far too many people remain uninformed about their treatment options. By working together, we expect to deliver a long line of innovative offerings that further improve the lives of millions of people around the globe. Now turning to global expansion, during the fourth quarter, we entered 5 new countries within Europe and the Middle East. Just this week, we expanded into Turkey and plan to launch in Australia later on this year. In the countries we serve today, we estimate there are 11 million to 12 million people living with insulin-dependent diabetes. We are in a strong position to capitalize on this large addressable market, given our focus to provide simple and widespread access to Omnipod. A technology we know greatly simplifies lives and provides better outcomes and quality of life. We are expanding internationally in a targeted and strategic manner and are building our go-to-market plans to enter larger geographies over time. We expect our total addressable market will grow significantly as we continue to expand internationally, bring innovations like Omnipod 5 to market and further displace legacy therapies. We have made significant investments throughout our entire global business to support our robust innovation pipeline and global expansion. And in the face of COVID, the progress we made this past year in our manufacturing and supply chain operations was remarkable. We not only maintained a high-quality production, kept facilities open and met product demand levels. We also opened a new manufacturing facility in China and installed our third U.S. manufacturing line, further expanding our manufacturing and supply chain redundancy. In summary, we delivered another strong quarter, finished the year on a high note and entered 2021 with significant momentum across our business. Our competitive differentiators remain unparalleled. And the upcoming launch of Omnipod 5 will significantly strengthen our market position, and marks a major milestone in our mission to simplify and improve the lives of people with diabetes. I will now turn the call over to Wayde. Wayde McMillan : Thanks, Shacey. Our fourth quarter results completed another year of solid growth and execution. Although challenged with the pandemic through 2020, we entered 2021 with positive momentum. This past year, we meaningfully advanced our strategic imperatives. Our focus to invest for accelerated revenue growth and expand margins while strengthening our financial profile will continue to drive significant value for all of our stakeholders and further our mission. In the fourth quarter, we delivered over 15% revenue growth, $9 million above our guidance range. The key driver of this outperformance was total Omnipod growth of 18%, which was $8 million above our guidance range. Drug delivery also finished slightly ahead of expectations by $1 million. While the pandemic was less of a headwind than initially estimated, it negatively impacted global new customer starts throughout 2020, largely beginning in the second quarter. As a reminder, this dynamic created a compounding impact on revenue in the second half of 2020. Looking ahead, we expect the impact to revenue will continue in 2021, although to a lessening degree. In the fourth quarter, the impact on new customer starts was more favorable than estimated in both the U.S. and international regions, with a combined effect of approximately 10% off of our beginning-of-the-year expectations. We were encouraged to see continued sequential improvements as we added almost 40% more global new customers in Q4 than we did in Q3. U.S. Omnipod revenue grew 18% in the fourth quarter. Our solid top line performance was driven by our growing customer base, increased Omnipod DASH adoption and the continued mix benefit as we shift into the pharmacy channel. Omnipod DASH drove over 65% of our U.S. new customer starts, and we grew volume through the pharmacy channel to over 35% of our total U.S. volume. This represents a continued increase in adoption of Omnipod DASH in the pharmacy. Moving forward, shifting our business model to the pharmacy remains a key priority as it reduces barriers and drives expanded access for Omnipod is more efficient for our customers, provides low, more predictable out-of-pocket costs and is easier to prescribe for physicians. Not to mention the number of benefits for payers. International on Omnipod revenue also grew 18%, driven by a growing customer base and more favorable performance in Europe than expected. Despite COVID related shutdowns in many European countries. Global attrition and utilization were again stable in the quarter. Drug delivery revenue decreased 11% due to timing of production. Gross margin was 65.5% in the fourth quarter, representing a 150 basis point increase, in line with our expectations. Our gross margin expansion continues to be driven primarily by our improved U.S. manufacturing operations as we further ramp our new automated lines as well as the ongoing benefit of volume mix shift into the pharmacy channel. Foreign currency was a 70 basis point tailwind, partially offset by a 40 basis point headwind from COVID related safety and mitigation costs. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter were above our expectations due to a $15 million charge related to the resolution of a contingency payment we disclosed the positive resolution in late December, and we\u2019re pleased to have reached favorable terms with our former European distributor and within our estimated range. Excluding this charge, operating expenses were in line with our expectations, including a stock award to all employees for their execution in a very challenging environment, as well as to mark our 20th anniversary as a company. As a result, we incurred a $7 million expense relating to a one-time equity bonus. This grant also serves as a way for our employees to be more invested in our company and our future, especially as we enter an exciting new phase with the launch of Omnipod 5 this charge was offset somewhat by lower R&D and selling and marketing expenses due to timing of projects, which we now expect will occur in 2021. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 14% in Q4, down from 17% in the prior year. We continue to invest throughout our business, including increases in advertising and brand awareness, innovation as well as scaling our global business to support our growth. For the full year, we delivered total Omnipod revenue growth of 23% and total company revenue growth of 22%, achieving another record year and further illustrating the strength and durability of our annuity revenue model. In 2020, we achieved gross margin of 64.4%, down 70 basis points and in line with our expectations. This included a 90 basis point unfavorable impact from COVID related costs and a favorable foreign currency impact of 20 basis points. Excluding COVID related costs, our gross margin finished on target with the original guidance we set at the start of the year. We are clearly seeing the benefit from our increased capacity and strengthen global manufacturing capabilities as we scale to meet growing global demand for Omnipod. We are also seeing the mix benefit from Omnipod DASH sold through the U.S. pharmacy channel. For the full year, we achieved adjusted EBITDA margin of 16%, up from 15%, exceeding our guide due to timing of spend. Turning to cash and liquidity, we remain in a strong position with our earliest debt maturing in 2024 and low cash interest expense. We ended 2020 with $962 million in cash and investments. Our sound financial position gives us flexibility to continue to invest in support of our long-term growth strategy. Now, turning to our outlook for 2021, our foundation for long-term, sustainable growth and value creation is clear. Although we will still be dealing with the global pandemic\u2019s effect on new customer starts from 2020 and into 2021. For the full year, we expect total Omnipod revenue growth of 17% to 21%, and total company revenue growth of 15% to 20%. By product line, we expect U.S. Omnipod revenue growth of 21% to 25%. This will be driven by volume growth of Omnipod DASH, aided by our increased investment in awareness, our differentiated pay-as-you-go model in the pharmacy with a mix benefit, expanded access and Omnipod adoption in the Type 1 and Type 2 markets. We will also benefit from the limited commercial launch of Omnipod 5 as we begin to ramp in the second half of the year. We expect full year 2021 International Omnipod revenue growth in the range of 10% to 15%, driven by further growth in our current and new markets. This will be offset in part by the expected persistence of the global pandemic in Europe as well as the compounding impact of lower customer starts from 2020. While we are encouraged that new customer starts improved as we exited 2020, the recent impact of COVID has been felt more strongly in Europe than the U.S. Lastly, we expect drug delivery to be in the range of an 11% decrease to a 4% increase based on our partner\u2019s current forecast. Looking now at gross margin, for full year 2021, we continue to expect to achieve our stated gross margin target of 67% to 70%. This expansion will be driven by global Omnipod volume growth, positive mix from the U.S. moving into the pharmacy and benefits from our enhanced manufacturing operations. Our teams continue to build efficiencies and scale into our manufacturing operations. We currently have two lines producing sellable product today and expect our third line to begin sellable production this year. In addition, our second contract manufacturer in China is an extension of our capabilities in that region, increasing our capacity and redundancy while balancing volume between the two sites. We are in a solid position to drive margin expansion this year. During 2021, we expect our operating expenses will largely rise in line with revenue growth, as we continue to invest and build upon our differentiated consumer-focused innovation and position in the large and underpenetrated Type 1 and Type 2 markets. One item to note is that as we mature as a company, and shift from developing Omnipod 5 to marketing and expanding access to the product. Certain clinical trial efforts will shift to support our commercial strategy. Other R&D activities will see a similar shift. As a result, we estimate approximately $15 million of costs will shift from R&D to SG&A in 2021. We expect 2021 operating margin to be in the low double digits range, up significantly from 5.7% in 2020. This balances our continued investment for growth with strengthening our financial profile. Finally, we expect capital expenditures to increase in 2021, primarily due to continued investments in manufacturing operations and expanded manufacturing capacity to support our fast-paced growth and the launch of Omnipod 5, as well as some carryover of expenditures from last year. Turning to first quarter 2021 guidance, we expect total company revenue growth of 20% to 24%. This includes total Omnipod revenue growth of 16% to 19%. By product line, we expect U.S. Omnipod revenue growth of 20% to 23% and international Omnipod revenue growth of 9% to 12%, reflecting the carryover headwind of lower global new customer starts in 2020 related to the pandemic as well as a continued impact on 2021, primarily internationally. We also expect drug delivery revenue of $18 million to $20 million. In conclusion, we are proud of how our team persevered in 2020. We delivered over 20% revenue growth, advanced our strategic imperatives and remain on track to launch Omnipod 5 in a few months. The unmet need in the diabetes market is extraordinary, and we expect Omnipod to further replace legacy therapies as we continue to grow our addressable market. Our priorities are clear. We expect the investments we are making and the capabilities we are building will drive sustainable, long-term growth and create long-term value for shareholders and allow us to deliver a strong pipeline of future innovations to the diabetes community. With that, we will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Larry Biegelsen : Good afternoon, guys and congratulations on nice end to the year here. So I guess, just one for me on the rollout of Omnipod 5. Shacey, what is a limited launch mean? Who is going to have access and who all have access and how is that going to evolve through the course of 2021? Thank you. Shacey Petrovic : Sure. Thanks for the question, Larry. And I did want to share in Q&A that we are under review now and that\u2019s part of what gives us great confidence in the launch into limited market release in the first quarter. Collaboration has been great and engaged on behalf of the agency. So, as we move into limited market release, we are looking to test a few things. So, the primary governor, as I said in my opening remarks, is going to be access. We have to establish broad access in the pharmacy channel. That work is underway, but will take us time to scale and so that\u2019s going to be the governor primarily. But what we will be looking for in limited market release, just in terms of indicators that it\u2019s successful and that we are ready to continue to expand as market access expands is we will be looking qualitatively just to understand the customer experience, the training experience and the access experience for people who are coming on to the product for multiple daily injections, for our existing users that are transitioning on to the product and for tube pump users that are transitioning on to the product. So we are just going to want it test that all of our systems, our training, our clinical support are going as we expect them to and the product experience is going as we expected to in each of those groups. As we validate that and as we establish access, that\u2019s what we will have us expand through the rest of this year and into full market launch either later this year or early next. We can move on to the next question. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Robbie Marcus : Great. Congrats on a great quarter. I am going to squeeze in two into my one here. One, Shacey, I was coming at that 40% growth number over third quarter was fantastic. I am coming out for the year at something a little over 51,000 new patient adds 52,000. I just want to make sure that\u2019s the right ballpark. And then Wayde, as you look at cadence through the year, what are you assuming for new patient growth from Omnipod 5 and how are you expecting that to impact the cadence throughout 2021? Thanks. Shacey Petrovic : Yes, Wayde, do you want to take that? Wayde McMillan : Yes. Sure, I can start it, Robbie. Thanks for the question and you are right, we were very happy to see the sequential improvement from Q3 to Q4. The pandemic certainly impacted us in the middle of the year, even in the U.S. and just as importantly, international to see it. Actually, Q4 was the first quarter that we saw improve new customer starts in both regions over prior year 2019 and 2019 was a really tough comp. We had record-breaking new customer starts in 2019, so absolutely right. That sequential improvement was important for us to see. We are not going to comment on specific numbers of customers, but as we shared in our earnings release, we now have 250,000 global customers. So, it\u2019s a good data point, I think for you. And then on new patient start growth for Omnipod 5, as Shacey said in her prepared remarks, it will be a limited release. And so there is a lot of scenarios running on that one. It really depends on what point in the year we get it launched here in the first half and then how we ramp. And as Shacey said, we are going to be monitoring a lot of things. We want to do a great job of both the user experience as well as developing access. And so again, just like Shacey said, it\u2019s those two things that will be pacing the ramp up over time and none of that diminishes our excitement around getting Omnipod 5 into the market next year. We have had just an immense interest from customers and our teams are and have been gearing up to launch Omnipod 5 for a couple of years now. So, lot of momentum, lot of excitement building, but we want to keep ourselves in check to make sure that we have the most successful launch we can. And part of that is limiting the ramp as we move through the end of the first half and into the second half of the year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Baird. Please go ahead. Jeff Johnson : Thank you. Good afternoon. A lot of things I would like to ask, but let me just focus, I guess, on longer term if I could and Wayde, maybe a two parter for you. I know you just gave 2021 guidance and still dealing with some COVID uncertainties. But for the past few years, we have kind of had that guiding light out there with your 5-year plan that you are calling for $1 billion in revenue by this year and mid-teens operating margins as well by this year. It looks like you are going to deliver revenue above that guidance this year, margins maybe fall short a bit for all the Omnipod 5 investment reasons you have talked about. But is there anyway to help us think about maybe the next 3 to 5 years again kind of give us a guiding light there even if you are not going to officially kind of comment on 5-year outlook? Can revenue growth sustain above 20% over the longer term here, intermediate to longer term and do margins start to expand again once we get through this heavy investment period in 2021? Do we think about margin expansion then going forward in \u201822/23 things like that? Thanks. Wayde McMillan : Yes. Thanks for your question, Jeff and we are spending a lot of time on it ourselves as well. I went through a robust long-term strategic planning session here. But we are not going to provide long-range planned guidance update until we get to the other side of Omnipod 5. It is a real pivotal launch for the company. And we are excited about what it can deliver. So we are pacing ourselves for an update to the long-range plan until we get a few quarters under our belt with Omnipod 5 and then we will be updating from there. You highlighted a few important things to the story though, which include the guidance here in 2021, which we feel is really strong, particularly for the U.S., 21% to 25% guidance for U.S. and less in international because we do see the pandemic headwinds persisting internationally more. We have covered a lot on our revenue guide in the prepared remarks. I think gross margin is pretty well understood at 67% to 70% in 2021. And there is going to be some phasing to that. We should expect Q1 to be below 67%, and then we will build into the range as we go through the year. There is quite a few drivers that will dictate whether we end up at the low end of that 67% to 70% range or at the high end. If we don\u2019t make 70% this year, we are committed to getting to 70% over time. So I think that was a part of your question, Jeff. As we think about gross margins, they are a key component of our financial thesis and we are confident that we will get to 70% over time. And then you mentioned the bottom line as well. We have a very strong operating margin guide here for 2021 in the low double-digits. That\u2019s a significant step up from 2020, but we should not assume the same step up beyond 2021. That is one area, while we have not guided to \u201822 and beyond, we want to make sure that everyone understands our investment thesis here, is to continue to invest to capitalize on our differentiated position in this very large unpenetrated market, both Type 1 and Type 2 markets. So you should inspect us to continue to invest heavily beyond 2021, in particular, in R&D and innovation, clinical, selling and marketing. We are going to be driving efficiencies as we scale in G&A and support functions. And so that will help us, along with the gross margin expansion to build a strengthening financial profile over time. But just to come back directly to your question, Jeff, I think we will continue to tick operating margin up annually, probably more like 1%, but not stepping it up every year like we are this year from \u201820 to \u201821. So we are not giving specific operating margin guidance for the future years, but I did want to make sure everyone fully understands our investment thesis here and that we are balancing our continued investments with our strengthening financial profile over time. So, thanks Jeff. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David Lewis : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a kind of nice quarter. Wayde, just want to come back to the Omnipod guidance globally, I mean the U.S. number, I think is a little stronger than people were expecting and obviously, the ex-U.S. number a little weaker based on the commentary you discussed in terms of European recovery, but we did see European recovery or European business in absolute dollars get better the last two quarters sequentially your guidance implies that will take a step back for the first time in the first quarter, sort of down 1Q versus 4Q. So just beyond what you\u2019re seeing in terms of resurgence is there anything going on from a competitive perspective, 780G, Control-IQ, what have you? Because it just seems that you were seeing some improvement in Europe in the first quarter guide and the \u201822 guide \u2013 sorry, the \u201821 guide sort of doesn\u2019t suggest that continues. So if you could flush it out, that would be great. Thanks so much. Wayde McMillan : Yes. Good question, David. Thanks. And we spend a lot of time on this because, as you know, and a lot of companies are challenged with really trying to peg guidance, and in fact, a lot of companies aren\u2019t guiding for this specific reason. The pandemic is tough to peg, obviously, more difficult outside the U.S., at least for us. We saw a pretty significant step-up and improvement in the U.S. as we\u2019ve progressed through the year. And as we said in our prepared remarks, we\u2019re only 10% off of our beginning of your expectations in Q4. The U.S. was on the better side of that. So almost back to our beginning of year expectations, and it was a record-breaking quarter for us ever. And so a lot of confidence in that U.S. guide. And like you said, it\u2019s \u2013 we think it\u2019s a strong guide. At both the high end and the low end, it will be higher growth dollars than it was in all of 2020. International, as you mentioned, David, it is feeling more of the compounding effect of our annuity model. So because the new customer starts were heavier impacted internationally in the last three quarters of 2020, it\u2019s going to feel it more in the first half of 2021. And then unlike the U.S., we\u2019re anticipating further pandemic impacts, the pandemic persisting into the first half of 2021 internationally. So that continues to compound into the numbers. So it is quite dramatic. Having said that, we have got a lot of momentum in our international business too, we have got the DASH rollout across all our new \u2013 all the regions internationally. We\u2019ve got 7 new countries. We\u2019re making investments in sales force expansion, we\u2019re also investing in marketing and direct-to-consumer pilots there as well. So that\u2019s what gives us the confidence to still guide to pretty strong double digits, 10% to 15%, in the face of a challenging pandemic environment internationally. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re comfortable with at this point of the year here at the start and happy to be providing guidance and insights for you all. And we will certainly track it as we go throughout the year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Jayson Bedford : Hi, good afternoon. Just a quick one for me. The recent milestone of 250,000 users, I guess, how recent? Was that a 2020 event or 2021 and just has there been any changes in the attrition or retention, however you want to frame it? Thanks. Shacey Petrovic : Sure, Jayson, yes, we are thrilled to be celebrating the milestone of 0.25 million users relying on Omnipod. It\u2019s really exciting for the organization. That\u2019s a recently-hit milestone. Obviously, it\u2019s all estimates. So I always want to of predicate it with that, but that was a 2021 event. And there have not been changes in attrition or utilization. Those have really remained steady. That\u2019s terrific, actually because, obviously, as we anticipated the impact of the pandemic, we did anticipate that potentially, attrition could tick up we didn\u2019t see that. And that\u2019s part of the driver behind the really strong performance in 2020 in the face of the pandemic. So that\u2019s great news on the business model and just the customer loyalty. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Lin from Cowen. Please go ahead. Chris Lin : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Just maybe one on Tidepool. It seems like Tidepool, could receive FDA approval eminently. I was curious if you have any commercialization plans for Omnipod and the Loop algorithm upon launch? And how this could impact your thinking Omnipod with iPhone? And more specifically, do you have anything factored into 2021 revenue guidance related to this product? Thank you. Shacey Petrovic : Sure. Thanks for the question, Chris, our partnership with Tidepool has primarily been a clinical and product development one. So we\u2019ve been supporting their regulatory submission and their development work. We don\u2019t have a commercial agreement at this point with Tidepool. So that\u2019s still to be worked out. I will say it\u2019s a tremendous undertaking to do that. So there is still a lot of work ahead of us. But that said, we do \u2013 we have said that we are working under way or we have work underway here with Omnipod 5 on the iOS platform. So I think it remains to be seen who\u2019s going to hit the market first with iOS, and we\u2019re certainly really excited about Omnipod 5. That remains our priority at this point. And we\u2019ll continue to support Tidepool\u2019s efforts in terms of their submission and their development. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Please go ahead. Joanne Wuensch : Good evening and thank you for taking the question. I was curious about the 35% to 40% Type 2 metric. That seems to be a nice step-up sequentially. And I\u2019m just curious if some of your DTC campaigning is heading towards that, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing that or if it\u2019s just sort of a natural development of the market? Shacey Petrovic : Sure. Thanks, Joanne, yes, we\u2019re really excited about just the continued in the Type 2 segment. It\u2019s just a group of users that have responded so well to the simplicity of DASH and some of the product benefits. I would say two things driving that. And one, as you know, is just increased awareness so that there are obviously a lot of people in the United States. We estimate over 2 million people living with insulin-dependent Type 2 diabetes who can benefit from the product. And so advertising as part of what\u2019s unlocking that. The other thing is you saw the step-up in increased access. And as we drive more availability in the pharmacy, this really differentiated business model that allows people to access it with such an affordable under $50 a month in out-of-pocket costs. That is in line with the cost of multiple daily injections for example. So it is incredibly affordable broad access that doesn\u2019t have the constraints that exist in other channels for the Type 2 segment. And that\u2019s sort of been our strategy really. We believe as we drive more simplicity into the product, we establish broader and affordable access to the tune of access in line with the cost of multiple daily injections. That\u2019s how we bring our technology to millions of patients, not just hundreds of thousands of patients. And so we\u2019re excited to see that. And I think that\u2019s part of what\u2019s been driving the Type 2 adoption and growth. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Margaret Kaczor : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. I\u2019ve got a couple of follow-ups on the Type 2s to Joanne\u2019s point. So can you guys give us a sense of how big Type 2s are as a percentage of the installed base what percent maybe have coverage under pharmacy? Is it close to that 75% that you referenced on the call for the Type 1 patients? And then anything around utilization for these Type 2 patients, given they are in some insulin needs versus a Type 1? Shacey Petrovic : Sure. Yes, I\u2019ll start, and then Wayde may have some color to add. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t have a lot of visibility. I\u2019ll explain why. As we drive more utilization into the pharmacy channel, we have less visibility at this point to diagnosis at coverage. And so that is a little bit of a challenge for us because, obviously, all of our Medicare reimbursement is through the pharmacy channel. And 40% of people living with insulin-dependent Type 2 diabetes are over the age of 50 or 60. And so you can imagine that there is a lot of overlap behind our Medicare coverage in the pharmacy channel and the Type 2 segment. In terms of access, 75% is a number for all commercial coverage. There actually isn\u2019t a distinction in the pharmacy channel between Type 1 and Type 2 coverage. So that number is good for both segments. And given the progress we\u2019ve made, particularly in Medicare Access, coverage is very strong and probably at $0 out-of-pocket for the Medicare user. So it\u2019s a really affordable, really broad access for the Type 2 user in the pharmacy channel, particularly for the Medicare Type 2 user. So I think all of that is contributing to the growth. And unfortunately, we don\u2019t have an updated total base number from what we gave a few years ago because we\u2019ve been driving so much growth into the pharmacy channel. This is great for users, great for payers and great for us. But right now comes with a bit of a visibility challenge. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Brien from Piper Sandler. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Karen on for Matt. We were hoping you could provide an update on the iPhone compatibility for Omnipod 5, do you think that will come later this year or will that be more of a 2022 event? And with over half of the population having an iPhone, how are you making sure that isn\u2019t a limitation uptake? Shacey Petrovic : Sure. So we\u2019re not going to give an update on the timeline. We really want to get Omnipod 5 to market, and then we can start updating time lines for all the innovations that will follow around additional sensor integrations and additional phone platforms. But I have said multiple times in the last couple of calls that this work is underway. So we have teams of very talented people working on iOS phone control. We don\u2019t envision this will be a limiting factor for two reasons. One is we will provide every user a back up PDM with SIM technology. This gives users a constant connectivity to data and all the benefits of Omnipod 5. And remember, you only need that PDM or your Samsung phone if you\u2019re using phone control to pair a pod and to announce a meal. Otherwise, and for every 3 days when you time a pod. But otherwise, you can remain in automated mode in closed-loop because of the algorithm on the pod without your phone or your PDM, and all of your data is able to be viewed via our apps on your iPhone. So you\u2019re still going to get all of that visibility and ease of use through our apps on your iPhone. So we think it\u2019s going to be a great user experience for Apple users, and we\u2019re working very hard to get them full phone control as quickly as possible, and we\u2019ll update once we get to market with Omnipod 5. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone from Jefferies. Anthony Petrone : Hi, thank you. A quick one for Shacey and quick one for Wayde. One would be on the preschool opportunity for Omnipod 5? And can you quantify how large that opportunity is? And maybe characterize the demand among parents to get preschoolers on an automated solution? And a quick one for Wayde would be on the automated U.S. and China lines when those reach scale, how would you quantify the gross margin tailwind? Thanks. Shacey Petrovic : Thanks, Anthony, I don\u2019t have a size for the preschool segment. This is a smaller segment, so ages 2 to 6. But I can tell you it\u2019s an outsized importance segments, both in terms of the value of the technology to this group as well as the value of this group to Insulet. Today, we are the market leader in pediatrics. We see our ability to maintain and expand that segment. You think about the benefits of Omnipod for this segment, the ease of use and the discretion for young active children versus small active children having to contend with 3 to 4 feet of tubing and a large device, it\u2019s a particularly differentiated technology today without CGM integration and automated insulin delivery. And when we combine that for this group, it\u2019s going to be incredibly powerful. So we know, based on the response and the feedback from our trial participants, and I think the strong indicator that 100% of users completed the trial and moved on to the extension phase, all really important indicators that we\u2019re going to have a winning product in this population. Wayde McMillan : Great. Thanks for the question on the operations strategy as well. Anthony, it\u2019s critical to our overall strategy, given that we want to make sure that we not only have capacity but also quality products and redundancy across the globe to make sure we can continue servicing our customers. And so along your question, from the automated lines in the U.S., we have two producing now and a third line installed that will be producing salable product on this year. So that more than doubles the capacity in our legacy China facility. And then you referenced the other China lines, which is the fact that we stood up a second third-party manufacturer in China during 2020, which also doubles our capacity out of our legacy facility. So, all of that together gives us significant capacity increase as well as the ability to balance it between the facilities. And that redundancy is important for us. The gross margin tailwind, it is the single largest driver, actually, of our gross margin improvement over time. As we begin to put more volume through all the plants, we scale more efficiently but in particular, our U.S. manufacturing facility that is automated and has mostly fixed costs limited variable costs. The more volume we put through there will become the most efficient plant that we have and so that will be a gross margin tailwind for us. So, all of the operations strategies are designed, number one, to get good quality product, a reliable product to our customers and also drive gross margin favorability for us. Operator : Thank you. So our next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor from UBS. Matt Taylor : Hi, thanks for taking the question. So question I had was you mentioned avid working on these sensor integration. So I was hoping you could just flesh that out a bit more and talk about the partnership and the timing there to any extent that you can? Shacey Petrovic : Sure, Matt. We\u2019re excited to be partnered with Abbott. Their product has been particularly adopted in international markets. There are certain countries where they are a dominant shareholder. And as they continue to drive ease of use and awareness, they are a terrific partner for us. As I mentioned, we won\u2019t be giving updated time lines until we get our current generation with DexCom out into the market. We\u2019re very excited about the value that, that\u2019s going to drive. But both sensor partners, DexCom and Abbott, are driving, they are transforming the market. They are bringing real-time insights to users. And that adoption is helping to fuel Omnipod adoption. And so both are very important to us. And we see the potential to bring a long line of innovations with our partnerships with both DexCom and Abbott. So we are working on that. Just like iOS, we have had teams of people focused on that integration, and that work is underway and excited to update the market after we get Omnipod 5 to the market. Operator : Thank you. So our next question comes from the line of Mathew Blackman from Stifel. Please go ahead. Mathew Blackman : Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks very much for the question. Just thinking ahead to the ENDO meeting next month, looking at some of the early abstracts posted on the meeting website. It looks like beyond the pivotal study, there is also a presentation from Dr. Bode looking at Omnipod 5 in Type 2 patients. Can you just remind us what that study is and how it relates to or even helped inform the larger Type 2 study you just started to enroll? Thanks. Shacey Petrovic : Sure. Yes, that\u2019s a great question. So Dr. Bode will be presenting some early results from our feasibility study in Type 2. So if you remember, we had mentioned on the last call that we had launched our feasibility work. And I mentioned in my remarks today that, that continues, enrollment continues. That research is going very well. We expect, and we are learning great things regarding the Type 2 segment. And so from those learnings, we will then enter into a larger pivotal study, which will then drive expansion in indications and the label for Omnipod 5. So that is what will play out over the coming months and potentially, a year or longer. We haven\u2019t given a timeline on that. But Dr. Bode will be sharing his experience and his research with Omnipod 5 in the Type 2 segment. We believe that our technology can bring tremendous value to this segment to drive improved outcomes, certainly and tremendous ease of use. And so we are committed to doing the research, and he\u2019s been a great partner with us on that front. Operator : Thank you. So our next question comes from Kyle Rose from Canaccord. Please go ahead. Kyle Rose : Great. Thank you very much for taking the questions. I think I heard you say this, Shacey, in the prepared remarks. So correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but it sounded like you\u2019ll be launching O5 or the Omnipod 5 only in the pharmacy channel. So I guess question one, is that correct? And then two, it sounded like access is going to be one of the more important drivers during the limited launch. So maybe just help us think about the time line to getting broader access in the pharmacy channel for Omnipod 5 and maybe some of the conversations you\u2019ve had with payers that have driven your decision to go solely on the pharmacy side? Shacey Petrovic : Sure. Kyle, you heard that correct that we will be launching Omnipod 5 in the pharmacy channel, and we will be launching at price parity. So that was a very thoughtful decision that we\u2019ve made. And the goal behind that is really just to drive more rapid access and more affordable access. And so what this means, it\u2019s actually really exciting because what this means is, today, as I mentioned earlier, a DASH user pays less than $50 a month on average for the technology, we\u2019re going to be able to bring our remarkable and advanced technology in Omnipod 5 for the same type of co-pay for users. I mean, in line with MDI for many users. So that is really exciting, and we think the right thing to do to truly unlock this population. It\u2019s a great channel for payers, a great channel for patients and a great channel for Insulet. We are driving into the pharmacy channel because of all of the benefits that we\u2019ve talked about, and we view Omnipod 5 as an opportunity to bring more users into that channel, which has great benefits for payers and for patients, frankly. So \u2013 and you are right that access will be the primary governor. I think back to DASH, we established \u2013 it took us about 2 years to establish broad access, where we are in the 70% plus range with DASH. And I would expect, if you think about what we were doing with DASH, we were also launching a new business model and establishing the channel, so, all of our partnerships and IT integrations with wholesalers and pharmacies. All of that work is now transferable and there and established for Omnipod 5. Our conversations are underway with payers and making good progress. And so we do expect that we will establish access more rapidly than DASH. But at this point, I think that\u2019s the primary performance indicator that we will be updating all of you on is just how we\u2019re doing with covered lives because that\u2019s going to be the primary driver of our success as we move through the limited market release. Operator : Thank you. So our next question comes from the line of Steven Lichtman from Oppenheimer & Co. Please go ahead. Steven Lichtman : Thank you. Hi, everyone. Shamcey, on Omnipod 5 for new potential customers interested in getting it who can\u2019t yet as you ramp pharmacy access, is there any reason for them to hold off or is it \u2013 will it be pretty seamless for someone moving from DASH to Omnipod 5 PDM? Any thoughts on how that transition from DASH to Omnipod 5 will work for customers that would be great? Shacey Petrovic : Yes. No reason for them to hold off. In fact, there may be reasons for them to get on, and I\u2019ll explain that. And when we think about the training pathways, the user interface with DASH is sort of the foundation and the user experience is the foundation for Omnipod 5 and so the training is likely to be much more streamlined for somebody who is moving from, for example, Omnipod DASH to Omnipod 5. And so it may just help you speed up if you get onto Omnipod DASH, as you\u2019re headed to Omnipod 5, but certainly no reason to hold off. As we said, we are not going to be charging any upfront conversion fee. Anybody, frankly, who is using any technology, whether that is Omnipod DASH, whether that is legacy Omnipod or MDI or a tube pump. As soon as we have pharmacy access established for them, they should be able to get on to the product with no upfront fee and very reasonable out-of-pocket costs. And we\u2019ve worked really hard to kind of conceive of and deploy that strategy to help bring our technology to more people more rapidly. Steven Lichtman : Thanks, Shacey. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Misra from Berenberg Capital. Please go ahead. Ravi Misra : Hi, thanks for taking the question. Can you hear me okay? Shacey Petrovic : Yes, we got you. Ravi Misra : Hey, great. Thanks. So I just wanted to \u2013 sorry if I asked, if this has been asked, I\u2019m jumping between calls. But just on the Type 2 kind of commentary that you\u2019ve been seeing, very strong adoption, very impressive in my view. Just from \u2013 can you help understand kind of what \u2013 it seems like there is a little bit of a kind of victorious circle or going on here between CGM adoption and Type 2 in pump adoption. Can you kind of maybe help tease out some of the dynamics there in terms of as access is getting easier for both? Is it kind of your kind of technology that\u2019s leading more people to get on to CGM, therefore, creating a virtuous cycle there or is it CGM usage that\u2019s kind of bringing your guys into there? And then maybe layering on how we think about the Abbott product and the work that you may be doing with them in this Type 2 segment? Thanks. Shacey Petrovic : Sure. I think all great observations there. There are, in my view, three things that are driving Type 2 adoption for Omnipod. And the first is we have the right business model in the right channel for Type 2 users. So the fact that we can provide this very affordable, broad access with very few constraints as part of what is driving adoption. The second is just increasing awareness of the simplicity of our technology, and that\u2019s coming through our efforts on both the sales and marketing front. And the third is CGM adoption. And this is actually a really important dynamic for us. As we think about not just 2021, but the next several years. What the CGM companies have done is really dramatically displace blood glucose monitoring in the Type 1 population. And now they have their sites set on the Type 2 population. And we\u2019ve been benefiting significantly from that conversion as patients, first in Type 1 and now more significantly, in Type 2. As these users get visibility to their data and how little time they are spending in range, they are looking for tools like Omnipod to help get them in range, and they are also comfortable wearing something because CGM has gotten them over that psychological barrier. So all three of those things are helping to drive our success in Type 2, and I think the technology is really well suited. So as we see progress and further advancement in adoption of CGM, this is a great trend for us in the market. Operator : Thank you. I show our last question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy from SVB Leerink. Please go ahead. Danielle Antalffy : Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks so much for squeezing me in and congrats on a pretty stellar year given the environment actually regardless of the environment. Shacey, question for you on Type 2 and how we should think about just echoing everyone\u2019s sentiment. I mean you\u2019ve done so well there. But what should we be thinking from an ultimate penetration perspective for insulin-dependent Type 2 patients? I mean is this a patient population given the barriers that you guys have broken down you think could reach close to \u2013 or maybe let\u2019s put it, standard of care versus MDIs or is there some different way to that this patient population manages their disease that they just might not be relevant per pump, the majority of them? Can you help us understand what you are thinking for ultimate penetration? Sorry, that was really long. Shacey Petrovic : Sure. Yes, sure. I think I won\u2019t comment on ultimate penetration because I just think it\u2019s going to take time with this segment. We\u2019re just in really early days here relative to the Type 1 segment. So we\u2019re more comfortable saying, hey, Type 1s can get over 50% because we\u2019re mature and we\u2019re \u2013 we see where we are in that adoption curve. We\u2019re standing on the precipice with Type 2s, and we\u2019re seeing great adoption, but it\u2019s very small penetration into this massive opportunity. When you think about the intensively managed Type 2 user, there really isn\u2019t much different in their need. And we do think that all of the work we\u2019re doing to establish broad, affordable access to drive unparalleled simplicity into our technologies that those advantages are, I would argue, more important for the Type 2 user than the Type 1 user. But regardless, they are important for all of our users and should drive continued adoption. And we see both segments, Type 1, particularly as we start \u2013 as we bring Omnipod 5 to market, we think that will be an accelerator for growth in the marketplace. And then as we look at Type 2, we\u2019ve got a product today that is incredibly simple and being very enthusiastic embraced. And then as we \u2013 kind of the next wave is as we bring the simplicity of Omnipod 5 to the Type 2 market, we think that can further unlock it. So we\u2019re excited about the long-term prospects for the Type 2 space. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our Q&A session. I would like to turn the conference back to Shacey Petrovic. Shacey Petrovic : Thank you. I wanted to share that recently one of our Omnipod 5 principal investigators for our pivotal study, Dr. Desalvo, from Baylor, he shared his feedback on Omnipod 5 with us. And what he said was to, not only have you achieved outstanding clinical results, but the diabetes burden has been ameliorated. And the satisfaction is unlike anything I have experienced before, especially for caregivers. It\u2019s clear that this is about the patients and their families. And he is right it is about our customers and their families. This is what gets us going every single day. We are so proud of the progress we\u2019ve made. We\u2019re now changing the lives of 0.25 million people across the globe, and we\u2019re not going to stop there. Insulet and our customers\u2019 days \u2013 best days are still ahead. So thank you very much. Have a great evening. We will talk to you next quarter. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participation, and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Insulet Corporation First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations. Deborah Gordon : Thank you, and good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Insulet's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. With me today are Shacey Petrovic, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Wayde McMillan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Both the replay of this call and the press release discussing our first quarter 2021 results and 2021 guidance will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such statements. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely adjusted EBITDA in constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. These measures align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance and we believe they are helpful to investors, analysts and other interested parties as measures of our operating performance from period to period. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis with the exception of revenue growth rates, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis. With that, I'll turn the call over to Shacey. Shacey Petrovic : Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are off to a strong start to the year, with first quarter revenue growth of 24%. Both our U.S. and international diabetes product lines achieved solid results with total Omnipod growth of 19%. We are on track to deliver another year of double-digit revenue growth. We have sustained momentum across our business, and we are preparing for the highly anticipated launch of Omnipod 5. We continue to execute at a high level, which speaks to the strength of our team and our deep commitment to Insulet's mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes. During the first quarter, we advanced each of our strategic imperatives, including expanding access and awareness, delivering consumer-focused innovation, growing our global addressable market and driving operational excellence. Let's begin with access and awareness and how Omnipod remains well positioned to further eliminate access barriers and displace legacy therapies. The progress we've made to date is largely due to the differentiated customer experience Omnipod provides, our tubeless form factor, simple user interface, unique business model and expanding presence in the U.S. pharmacy channel. There are millions of people around the globe living with diabetes, and yet this population is critically underserved. There are far too many people that either don't have access to Omnipod, are unaware of our product, or in some cases, both. This must change as Omnipod can simplify lives and deliver improved outcomes. The value Omnipod provides is clearly demonstrated by our ability to drive new customer growth from multiple daily injection users in the type one and type two segments. Approximately 80% of our new customers switch from MDI to Omnipod. Additionally, in the first quarter, between 35% and 40% of our new U.S. customers were type 2. Much of this growth has been driven by Omnipod DASH, which offers tremendous benefits compared to existing therapies. As a result, we continue to transition a growing percentage of our U.S. pod volume through our pay-as-you-go model in the pharmacy channel. This provides increased access for customers, low co-pays and no upfront costs or multiyear lock-in periods. It simplifies access, making Omnipod easier to prescribe for physicians, provides a number of benefits to payers and drives our recurring revenue. Today, our technology and form factors stand at the forefront of innovation, while our U.S. pharmacy channel and pay-as-you-go business model are eliminating long-standing access barriers. This combination uniquely positions Insulet to further penetrate both the type one and type two insulin intensive markets. By the end of Q1, we had secured coverage for over 75% of U.S. covered lives for Omnipod DASH, and the majority of our new customers across the globe start on Omnipod DASH. At the same time, we are focused on expanding Omnipod awareness, given the diabetes market is large, yet critically underserved. Last year, we launched our direct-to-consumer advertising campaign in the United States. The reaction to date has been positive, and we have already started to see incremental new customer starts. We have also begun to pilot DTC in the United Kingdom. It is early days for both our domestic and international campaigns. But we know there is tremendous opportunity to help more people across the globe learn about the life-changing benefits of Omnipod. Driving access and awareness are core components of our growth strategy and complement our commitment to delivering market-leading innovation. We believe the combination of enhanced access and superior innovation, improves outcomes and makes living with diabetes or caring for loved ones less burdensome. All of this has resulted in consistently strong Omnipod adoption and customer retention and a global customer base that surpassed 0.25 million people in Q1. We accomplished this despite not having an AID product in the market, and this will soon change with our Omnipod five automated insulin delivery system, which we believe is the future of insulin delivery. Omnipod five unlocks a new level of freedom and simplicity through easier insulin management and significantly improved glucose control. The number of firsts Omnipod five brings to market is compelling. It is the first tubeless, entirely wearable AID system with a personalized, adaptive on-target algorithm embedded in every pod. This means there is no need to disconnect or interrupt therapy other than the few minutes it takes to change a pod every three days. This is critical as interruptions in continuous insulin delivery lead to suboptimal outcomes. Managing diabetes will be easier and more discrete as Omnipod five customers will have complete smartphone control for all system functions. At launch, we will offer full control from personal Android smartphones and every customer will also receive a controller that includes a SIM card. This marks another important distinction between Omnipod five and other options available in the market. No other AID system offers real-time connectivity, even when not near WiFi and real-time remote monitoring through SIM and personal phone control. Omnipod five users will always be able to view their data on their smartphones and loved ones will always be able to know how their Podders are doing in real time on the Omnipod five VIEW app. Omnipod five is the only system with customizable glucose targets for different times of day and also a hypo protect feature that can be used in times of greater hypoglycemia risk. Additionally, our AID system is the only one to provide a smart bolus calculator that recommends more or less insulin based on a user's CGM trend, not just the CGM value alone. All of this while maintaining the same form factor our customers love. We are confident that Omnipod five will mark a major improvement in quality of life and diabetes management. In the U.S., Omnipod five will be available only through the pharmacy channel. We'll utilize our unique pay-as-you-go model and will be priced at parity with Omnipod DASH. As a result, the low monthly out-of-pocket costs for Omnipod five should be comparable to both Omnipod DASH and MDI. Like Omnipod DASH, we expect the majority of Omnipod five customers in the U.S. to have a monthly pharmacy co-pay of under $50. In addition, through our 30 Days of Freedom trial, anyone can try Omnipod five free for 30 days. Our goal is to quickly secure broad affordable coverage and expanded access. We believe the broad coverage we have established for Omnipod DASH will continue to serve as a major competitive advantage and a strong foundation for our efforts to drive access to Omnipod 5. Although Omnipod five has breakthrough device designation and the FDA has been incredibly supportive and collaborative throughout its review process, the clearance time line is taking longer than we had anticipated. The feedback we have received to date has been in line with our expectations, and we remain optimistic that we will receive Omnipod five clearance by the end of June or shortly thereafter. But given the current environment and the associated lengthened review time, clearance could shift into the second half of the year. As a result, we now expect to begin our limited commercial release in the second half of 2021. We do not expect this will have a material impact on revenue guidance, and our internal teams are certainly not standing still. We are building Omnipod five inventory. We are developing commercial launch materials and testing our systems and processes, and we are securing coverage for Omnipod 5. Our teams are geared up for what we fully expect will be the best technology and customer experience on the market and a wildly successful launch. The value Omnipod five offers to people with diabetes was clearly demonstrated via the impressive pivotal data we shared in March at ENDO 2021. Our pivotal study included children and adults ages six to 70. Compared to standard therapy, Omnipod five achieved significantly higher time and range and improved A1c while maintaining or lowering hyperglycemia. After three months on Omnipod 5, 53% of children and 66% of adults achieved an A1c of less than 7%. Time and range for children increased 16 points to 68%, while timing range for adults and adolescents increased nine points to 74%. Additionally, time in hypoglycemia was reduced for adults and remained very low in children. Omnipod five will offer meaningful value for individuals living with diabetes as well as for their families, physicians and payers. It's a clear testament to our innovation team that we were able to achieve this very competitive time in range, while also delivering the strongest published hypoglycemia performance. We have additional Omnipod five abstracts accepted for presentation at upcoming diabetes conferences in June. These address a number of important areas, including performance in preschool aged children, the transition from multiple daily injections directly on to Omnipod five and quality of life outcomes. Also on the clinical front, we had impactful domestic and international data recently published in several leading peer-reviewed diabetes journals. Collectively, the results shared in these publications demonstrate that Omnipod can drive improved outcomes across a broad range of people living with either type one or type two diabetes. These improved outcomes span multiple age groups and disease states as well as people coming from different forms of therapy. We continue to invest clinically and have a compelling road map, including our work to expand our Omnipod five indication to preschoolers down to H2 and to secure a type two indication. The first phase of our preschool study is complete, and we are progressing well through our planned 12-month extension phase, which allows us to collect longer durable outcomes and allows our trial participants to continue on Omnipod 5, which they all elected to do. Additionally, our type two feasibility study is now fully enrolled and the results are illuminating. During ENDO 2021, Dr. Bruce Bode presented early data from our type two study that showed encouraging results for Omnipod 5, with time and range that more than doubled in the first eight weeks. The type two diabetes market offers tremendous opportunity for Insulet, and we will continue to innovate to further penetrate this largely underserved population. The depth and breadth of the clinical data published and presented in just this last quarter demonstrates our commitment to building strong clinical evidence that supports how Omnipod will continue to improve outcomes for people living with insulin-dependent diabetes. We continue to advance our pipeline, and we look forward to sharing additional clinical data in the future. Omnipod five is our top innovation priority. However, we are diligently working to advance a robust pipeline that extends well beyond. We know that our success over the long term requires leadership in critical areas such as software development, data science and other core competencies. This includes the integration of Omnipod five and our future products with next generations of products by Dexcom and Abbott. Beyond Omnipod 5, we have begun product development on innovations that we believe will offer significant value to people living with both type one and type two diabetes. Moving to global expansion. We are expanding access and awareness of Omnipod in a number of attractive markets. Last year, we entered five new countries within Europe and the Middle East. This quarter, we expanded into Turkey, and we continued to gear up for an expected launch in Australia later this year. Our international expansion efforts will drive access to a huge global addressable market. Across our current footprint, we estimate there are 11 million to 12 million people living with insulin-dependent diabetes. We see attractive future expansion opportunities that will further grow our total addressable market and bring our technology to people living with diabetes around the world. The international launch of Omnipod DASH has been highly successful and work is underway to bring Omnipod five to our international markets. Lastly, we continue to invest significantly in our global manufacturing operations. We are well positioned to meet growing consumer demand for Omnipod DASH as well as the commercial launch of Omnipod 5, our broader innovation pipeline and our future international expansion plans. Operational excellence is one of our key strategic imperatives that is enabling growth today and will do so well into the future. As part of this strategy, Insulet is committed to responsible and sustainable growth. We have developed a comprehensive sustainability strategy that builds upon our existing capabilities, provides value to our stakeholders and considers the most important ESG issues that affect our business, society and planet. We recently published our 2020 sustainability report, which outlines our commitment to addressing important ESG issues and highlights our key priorities. All of us at Insulet are dedicated to a business resiliency and responsible business practices that help our customers, our employees and our communities thrive. In closing, we are off to a strong start in 2021. We expect to deliver another year of double-digit revenue growth, launch Omnipod five and advance our innovation pipeline to continue to bring life-changing innovations to people with diabetes in order to simplify and improve their lives. I'll now turn the call over to Wayde. Wayde McMillan : Thank you, Shacey. We continue to execute at a high level and look forward to the limited market release of Omnipod 5. Our strategic imperatives are supported by continued investments across our business to drive long-term revenue growth and margin expansion. We delivered 24% revenue growth in the first quarter, achieving the high end of our guidance range, driven by strong total Omnipod growth of 19%. As we previously discussed, the pandemic's impact on global new customer starts in 2020 will have a compounding impact in 2021, primarily in the first half. While the pandemic is persisting globally with ongoing challenges mainly throughout Europe and Canada, we are navigating them well and driving continued growth. In the U.S., our new customer starts were a record for any Q1 in our history, and second only to the very strong Q4 we achieved last year. We accomplished this while also driving strong international performance. In Q1, we delivered U.S. Omnipod revenue growth of 23%, benefiting from our growing customer base, Omnipod DASH adoption and ongoing mix benefit as we shift volume into the pharmacy channel. Omnipod DASH continues to ramp and drove over 70% of our U.S. new customer starts. In addition, we grew pharmacy channel volume to approximately 45% of our total U.S. volume. This is up significantly compared to last year, representing a meaningful increase and contributing to our top line growth. Expanding our presence in the U.S. pharmacy channel remains a key strategic imperative as we plan to drive increased access for Omnipod DASH and Omnipod five once launched. International Omnipod revenue grew 13%, ahead of our expectations. Performance was driven primarily from our expanding customer base and ability to navigate through COVID-19-related challenges. The full launch of Omnipod DASH throughout our international markets last year is helping to drive growth this year as the majority of our international new customers start on Omnipod DASH. Omnipod DASH continues to generate physician interest and drive hospital access. To a smaller degree, international Omnipod revenue in Q1 also benefited from timing of PDM orders, which can vary from quarter-to-quarter given our distributor channels. We are also pleased that our global attrition and utilization once again were stable this past quarter. Drug delivery revenue more than doubled in line with our expectations. Growth was unusually high due to increased product demand this year versus the low production levels last year, which resulted from a slower than typical manufacturing start-up. Both of these drivers were due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Gross margin was 66.4% in the first quarter, representing a 230 basis point increase or 120 basis point increase on a constant currency basis. Our gross margin expansion was driven primarily by improved manufacturing operations and supply chain efficiencies, the ongoing benefit as we transition more volume into the pharmacy channel in the U.S. and a decrease in COVID-related mitigation costs. Partially offsetting these increases were the expected higher mix of costs as we continued to ramp U.S. manufacturing. Operating expenses in the first quarter were $151 million, primarily due to our investments to support our innovation pipeline development efforts and the upcoming launch of Omnipod five as well as our broader direct-to-consumer advertising. Operating margin was 6.5%, up from 3.8% and adjusted EBITDA margin was 14%, up from 12.3%, all were in line with our expectations. Overall, we're off to a great start in 2021 as both our diabetes product lines generated record performance, and we continued to invest across our organization to support our growth strategies and drive future expansion. This includes increasing advertising to drive brand awareness, and strengthening our commercial and R&D resources to support Omnipod five and our innovation pipeline as well as geographic expansion. Turning to cash and liquidity. We remain in a strong position with our earliest debt maturing in 2024 and low cash interest expense. We ended the first quarter with $850 million in cash and short-term investments. We recently completed a $500 million Term Loan B financing as well as a separate $60 million revolving line of credit. Our goal over the long term is to strengthen our access to traditional capital market financing, diversify our capital structure and over time, drive our gross leverage ratio down to 5 times bank EBITDA. This marked our first step and an important one in that direction. We plan to use the Term Loan B financing to pay down a portion of our outstanding convertible notes due 2024. This will lower our cost of capital while also maintaining flexibility to pursue future strategic investments. Now turning to our outlook for the remainder of this year. We are raising the low end of our full year revenue guidance to 16% to 20%, up from prior 15% to 20%. This includes raising the low end of total Omnipod revenue guidance to 18% to 21%. In the U.S., we are raising the low end of full year Omnipod revenue growth to 22% to 25%. This will be driven primarily by Omnipod DASH volume growth, the benefits of our efforts to drive expanded access and awareness, our differentiated pay-as-you-go model and the mix benefit we realized in the pharmacy channel. Also driving growth is our expectation for further Omnipod customer adoption in both the type one and type two markets. We also expect growth will benefit to a lesser degree from the limited market release of Omnipod 5. For international Omnipod, we are raising the low end of full year 2021 guidance to 11% to 15%. In the near term, we continue to expect our international business to be impacted by the pandemic and related challenges, combined with the compounding impact on new customer starts from 2020. With that said, we are encouraged by the adoption rates of Omnipod DASH and our plan for driving expanded market penetration internationally. Lastly, we are reaffirming our revenue expectations for drug delivery in the range of an 11% decrease to a 4% increase. Turning to gross margin. We continue to expect full year gross margin in the range of 67% to 70%. Our gross margin expansion drivers remain the same : increased scale and efficiencies provided by our global manufacturing operations and positive mix from the continued volume shift into the U.S. pharmacy channel. We also benefit from a planned reduction in COVID-related mitigation and safety-related costs. We continue to expect operating expenses will largely rise in line with revenue growth this year as we invest in consumer-focused innovation and best position ourselves for increased market penetration. This includes investments in our sales and marketing teams ahead of the launch of Omnipod five and to support our international market initiatives. As a result of our strong revenue growth, combined with gross margin expansion and the investments we are making across our business, we are reaffirming operating margin for full year 2021 in the low double-digit range, up significantly from 5.7% in 2020. We expect operating margin will improve sequentially throughout the year. Lastly, we continue to expect capital expenditures to increase in 2021 as we further invest in our global manufacturing operations and strategic imperatives to support our strong growth expectations. Turning to our second quarter 2021 guidance. We expect total company revenue growth of 10% to 14%. This includes total Omnipod revenue growth of 14% to 17%. We expect Q2 U.S. Omnipod revenue growth of 17% to 20%, driven primarily by our growing customer base fueled by Omnipod DASH volume growth and the mix benefit we realized in the pharmacy channel. As a reminder, Q2 growth is impacted by the tough prior year comparison where we experienced a net impact of estimated distributor channel and end customer inventory levels at the start of the pandemic. We expect international Omnipod revenue growth of 10% to 13%. This reflects the ongoing growth in our customer base from increased Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by the headwind of lower new customer starts in 2020, stemming from the pandemic as well as the continued pandemic impacts throughout many of our international markets. Also, the benefit in Q1 from the timing of Omnipod DASH PDM orders is not expected to occur again in Q2. We also expect drug delivery revenue to decline 16% to 24% due to the normalization of order volumes in the current year as compared to elevated levels in the prior year due to the pandemic. In conclusion, we are off to a strong start in 2021. We remain on track for robust revenue growth and operating margin expansion continue to advance our strategic imperatives and are in a solid financial position to continue to invest for growth. We are building a foundation for long-term sustainable revenue growth, margin expansion and increased value creation for our stakeholders. With that, we'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : Operator  [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Baird. Jeff Johnson : Sorry, guys, I was on mute. Shacey, I just wanted to start with a question on the timing around Omnipod 5. It sounds like -- I don't want to put words in your mouth, but a couple of few weeks of potential delay here. That's kind of the wording we heard last night from one of your competitors on a mobile bolus app. So I guess, two things. One is, are some of these delays tied more to just the FDA is overwhelmed right now with COVID-related items? Or maybe overwhelmed in some other way? Are they nervous at all on phone and mobile bolusing apps and just kind of phone control? Just wondering kind of what you're hearing from the FDA for that delay? And how confident are you that it might be that short time period, however long you want to define that? Shacey Petrovic : Yes. Thanks, Jeff. Well, I think it's true. It's kind of an industry-wide thing. Like others, we are experiencing the longer-than-expected review process. I don't believe this is due to anything but just the workload, frankly, at the agency. And we're really sensitive to that. They have done an incredible job navigating through all of the challenges related to the pandemic. Our local team, our review team has been incredibly responsive and collaborative. And so we feel very good about where we are, we're in the final stages of this review process. And I don't believe that there's any sort of any other drivers outside of the workload tied to the pandemic. In fact, we gave ourselves quite a bit of buffer in the time line. And so my remarks are really prompted by the fact that we're getting through that buffer. And so the review process is taking a bit longer than we expected. But we're in the final stages and feel good about where we are. Operator : I show our next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Robbie Marcus : Great. Two for me. One, Wayde, I'd love to get a sense of after you gave guidance at the end of February on the fourth quarter earnings call, how the rest of third quarter trended? I know diabetes can sometimes have different trends than what we see across the rest of med tech in terms of procedure volumes? And then how it played out versus your expectations throughout the rest of the quarter? Wayde McMillan : Robbie, yes, sounds good. And it's actually a really good question because there's quite a few dynamics rolling out. And I think diabetes does have some uniqueness to it. So why don't we think about it first in the U.S. and what we've seen in the U.S. is really at the end of 2020, we saw the access to customers and the market really start to turn. We're still dealing with some pandemic issues in the U.S., but we really saw it start to level out in the end of Q4 '20 and obviously, with a 23% growth rate here in the quarter start to pick up. One thing we've talked about in the past that was unexpected was we thought we would see seasonality change a little bit more in Q1 in -- moved into the pharmacy. We have 45% of our volume in the pharmacy now and we really didn't see that. So that was kind of a unique impact. And we think it's really due to the fact that customers still have buying patterns that are related to the legacy market paradigm here in diabetes and the traditional order patterns of buying more in Q4 as well as people throughout the value chain, distributors, wholesalers, even physicians thinking about prescribing pumps at the end of the year versus the start of the year. So I think it's going to take more time than we expected to see some of those seasonal trends take place. And as we think about the rest of the year for the U.S., I mean, really strong. We think we've got a strong guide for the second half, and we start to build momentum. Just a reminder that we do have an annuity model here at Insulet. And so we start to build momentum. We had a record Q1 start -- new customer starts here. We had a record Q4 in 2020. So you put those two together, and we're starting to build momentum up again and you see that start to build in our growth rate here in the second half. That's implied in our guide. And then internationally, it's a different story. We are seeing the pandemic persist. It was longer and more difficult through the end of 2020. And we can see that as it rolls into our annuity model here in the first half of 2021. And so we'll see that persist longer internationally. Having said that, we still feel we had a pretty strong growth rate, 13% in the face of the challenges that the team has seen internationally. And just to highlight a couple of the things we're dealing with. We're -- our business is concentrated in a few of the larger regions like the U.K. and France. And those are the regions where we've seen more lockdowns and more persistence of the pandemic. And so when some of those regions are more challenged, it's harder for our teams to get in and get customers started on new product. But I mentioned in the prepared remarks, where we are seeing good traction is a lot of interest in our new DASH product, and so that is giving our teams reasons to meet with physicians and with customers. And so we are starting to see signs of improvement internationally as well. We do think it will persist a little longer into the second half, and that's reflected in our growth rates. At the high end of our growth rates, we get up to that 17% range. And as you know, our expectations for the region are high-teens, low-20s. So optimistically, if we see the pandemic start to calm down internationally as well, we'll start to get back into that high-teens growth rate. Operator : I show our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : Shacey, one on type two patients. This is the second quarter in a row, it was 35% to 40%. Do you see it stabilizing there? Or do you see it growing further? And secondly, how often are type two patients changing their pods. They tend to use more insulin? So are they doing it more frequently than every three days on average? Shacey Petrovic : Yes. Larry, great questions. I'll start with the first one. We actually haven't really seen a change in utilization that is noticeable at the population level between type two and type 1. And I think that comes down to a reduction in total daily dose of insulin. And in fact, we mentioned this in the press release, but we had some incredible data published this last quarter, most recently -- or on type two rather, the data was published in diabetes research and clinical practice. And this looked at almost 3,600 patients and demonstrated statistically significant reduction in A1c, but maybe even more surprisingly a 32% reduction in total daily dose of insulin. And that was regardless of which therapy they were coming from multiple daily injections or previous pump therapy. So I think that points to the value of Omnipod and site rotation among other things, and it's probably playing out in the patient experience out there, which is why we don't see, broadly, utilization increasing in the population. It was steady this quarter. And then the other question that you had, on type 2... Wayde McMillan : 35% to 40%. Shacey Petrovic : Was 35% to 40%. It actually has ticked up every quarter. It's just a broad range. So it is growing, and it is probably growing faster than our total new customers, which are growing quickly as well. Operator : I show our next question comes from the line of Marissa Bych from Morgan Stanley. Marissa Bych : This is Marissa Bych from Morgan Stanley. I just wanted to go back, Wayde, and I appreciate your commentary on the second quarter guidance and the ex U.S. COVID-19 impact is very understandable. In the U.S., it seems like the sequential growth that we're expecting for the second quarter versus the first quarter is a little bit lower than history, just based on pharmacy seasonality. Is that really the entirety of the story in the U.S.? Or is there anything else that we're missing in terms of COVID resurgences or really anything else? Wayde McMillan : Yes. Marissa, I think you've got most of it. I would just highlight one of the things I called out in the prepared remarks was the tough comp we have, and that's because of the inventory build we saw last year in Q2 at the start of the pandemic. That's about a 5% impact to the growth rate. So if you add -- if you just add that tough comp for the inventory last year, that puts us into the mid-20s, even above the Q1 growth rate and so that's in there. But as you mentioned, there's also some dynamics between Q1 and Q2. The pharmacy channel, we're still learning. It's still new to us and we're still monitoring it and to see how that plays out. But another way to think about Q2 for us is we have -- at the high end of our guide, a similar sequential dollar growth rate, $12 million growth rate, same as we experienced last year. So that's another thing to ground on. We'll see how it goes. We're also closely watching the pandemic in the U.S. We're not free and clear of that yet, and the teams are doing a great job selling through it. Our virtual training capabilities are really helping us here. And we'll see how that continues to play out in the U.S. We're very optimistic with vaccine rollout across the U.S. and things continued to improve. And again, if you normalize for the growth rate that puts us into that mid-20s. And then our implied growth rate in the U.S. for the second half is mid to high-20s. And so in an annuity model, just a reminder for everybody, it takes several quarters to build up the new customer starts. Last year, Q2 for us was a low new customer start quarter, but we still had 30% growth because of the momentum coming into the quarter. So we're excited here to be building momentum again, setting record new customer start quarters. And if we can continue to do that, you'll see the growth rates climb into that guidance -- implied guidance of high 20% growth rates in the second half. Operator : I show our next question comes from the line of Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Unidentified Analyst : This is actually Brandon on for Margaret. I wanted to follow up on the type two Omnipod five data. It sounds really encouraging that the data is coming out nicely. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more details on what the next steps are there. Does the -- do the algorithms need to be tweaked for the type two patient? Or can we kind of move forward with what you have now and run additional data, if that's what's needed? So just trying to understand what next steps are for type two and Omnipod 5. Shacey Petrovic : Sure, Brandon. Thank you for the question. And yes, as I mentioned, this has been an area of focus for us. We're really excited about the early data that Dr. Bruce Bode presented at ENDO. And we believe that the data was very positive so far with our feasibility study. So we will take this data and if it remains positive as we close out the feasibility data, we will be able to move into a pivotal. But we'll sort of reserve the right to potentially make changes to the algorithm depending on the final results that we get out of our feasibility study. But so far, so good. The data is really encouraging to date. Operator : I show our next question comes from the line of Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. Jayson Bedford : I apologize if this has been asked. I've kind of been jumping between calls here. And I don't mean to be critical with the question because obviously, the growth is impressive here. But you've developed a history of exceeding estimates. This quarter, I'd say it was at the high end but didn't necessarily exceed. Was there anything specific that you saw in the month of March that maybe you didn't expect? Wayde McMillan : Jayson, it's Wayde. I can take that one. Well, first of all, international was above the high end of the range and the U.S. was right at the high end of the range. So there wasn't anything too much to really complain about, as you said. The one thing that was a little surprising to us is we were expecting some more favorable seasonality in Q1 in the pharmacy channel. Now that we've got 45% of our volume rolling through there. It was a small thing, but that was one thing that we are expecting to see. And we do think that will continue to develop, it just may take a few years to change behavior, not just for customers but all through the value chain. But other than that, as you know, Jayson, we've got a lot of new things going on in both regions, but in particular in the U.S., the pay-as-you-go model is still relatively new. Our move into type two is new. The DTC campaigns are new. Even DASH uptake is still accelerating for us. So as we think about guidance, we've got a lot of puts and takes, and we're very happy still dealing with the pandemic to print the 23% growth rate. On a dollar basis, I think the strongest of all the companies out there and we're continuing to expand our leadership position. And so I think as we're approaching $1 billion, our growth rates don't look as impressive as some others, but we're happy to be growing stronger on a dollar basis. Operator : I show our next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy from SVB Leerink. Danielle Antalffy : This question, Shacey, is around the type two opportunity. And you guys have been so successful there. So I don't want to sound too greedy, but it feels like there's still such an untapped opportunity today, even with all the work you've done and all the success you've had at the primary care physician level. We've been doing a lot of work here and talking to primary care physicians. And it feels like they manage so many of these patients, there's still a lot of opportunities. So just curious if you could talk a little bit more about whether there's any special efforts towards the primary care physician, are you expanding your touch with the primary care physicians or just how you're going after that market from the physician level, I guess, versus patients. Shacey Petrovic : Sure, Danielle, and it's a great question, something we think a lot about. I think you're right, our success in the type two population does not rest on Omnipod 5. For the insulin-dependent type two user, we have an outstanding value proposition with Omnipod DASH. And you can see it in the adoption trajectory. We are uniquely differentiated in this space because of the simplicity of DASH, because of our market access position with DASH and because of our business model, and it's showing in the growth of that segment. And then I referenced the clinical data earlier. You add to that clinical outcomes and the data that was published this quarter, looking at those 3,600 patients and showing a 32% reduction in total daily dose of insulin and such an improvement in A1c, that's just really, really powerful. And so I think we -- I guess the other thing that we do is really address a recognized and frustrating compliance challenge that exists for the clinician and for the patient. And that's because of pods' form factor and simplicity. So I think at a high level, we believe that Omnipod has the potential to change how clinicians are thinking about therapy in insulin-dependent type two patients. And that's because of all the things that we know already, our simplicity, our user interface, but also the simplicity in access and prescribing. With no upfront cost, no lock-ins and for a physician, it's just a very easy e-script. And then clinicians and patients can try Omnipod for free. And that -- those are tactics all designed to change physician behavior and patient behavior. And we're having a lot of success with that in the Endo office today. But you're right, we also have begun to pilot new approaches in our messaging, in our education and in our physician targeting because we know there's there is such a huge opportunity and because we are so well positioned in it. So we're looking at our calls to action in DTC and how we target patients and clinicians. We're looking at piloting physician targeting of PCPs and looking at our training and support model. So all sorts of things. And I think ultimately, you're right to that awareness, both among people living with insulin-dependent type two and their clinicians. Awareness is really critical to continuing to unlock this opportunity. So I think the good news is we're having a lot of success today in the Endo office with Omnipod DASH. I think as you look to the future, there's even more exciting things on the horizon, both with Omnipod five and with our ability to move potentially into new physician segments. Operator : I show our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Joanne Wuensch : I'm trying to get some timing on a couple of things. Sort of out there is the pediatric label for Omnipod 5, the type two label for Omnipod five and then the integration with Abbot's Libre. Can you just -- if you want to get in quarters or even first half versus second half, sort of get us an idea of when you think we might be seeing those approvals? Shacey Petrovic : Well, the one thing that we have given a time line publicly on is the pediatric label. And so all of our internal efforts on that front are on track. We have collected the data, finished the study, everything looks good, and we're getting ready to submit shortly to the FDA on that front. And so that would put us on track in a normal world, put us on track for a label expansion by the end of this year. Obviously, we do recognize, though, that we do have challenges today in terms of the workload and what the FDA is contending with. So I just caution everybody. We're on track on our end and working certainly hard to make that happen. We haven't given time lines yet on the Type two label indication or on Libre label indication. Just to indicate that, that work is underway. But to give you some sense of things, just remember that we are right now in a feasibility study for type 2, so the next step would be to move into a pivotal study. So there still is some clinical work to do before we're ready to submit to the FDA for the label expansion. And then Libre, what we've said is that work is underway. That will also include a submission to the FDA, but not any clinical work. So that just kind of gives you a sense of what's ahead of us. And we'll get more granular with our time lines once we have Omnipod five into full commercial release, which is 100,000% where most of the team is focused today. Operator : I show our next question comes from the line of Kyle Rose from Canaccord. Kyle Rose : Just two on my side, and I'll ask them up front. Just from a big picture perspective, it kind of feels like the company, and for that matter, the broader diabetes industry is kind of shifting more towards a software focus rather than just purely on the hardware side. I mean you've obviously got big investments there, and you've done a lot of work already when we think about DASH and the apps in the Omnipod five side. But just what other investments do you need to make from a software perspective for future projects? I'm just trying to understand how much of the investment has already been made versus some of the investments that need to be made in the future? And then with respect to the launch of O5, just any commentary around expectations for covered lives when you do move into the controlled launch? And how we should think about maybe the first 12, 18 months from a reimbursement perspective? Shacey Petrovic : Great. Kyle, both good questions. So first on software. This has been a significant focus and it's funny because we say software, other people say digital. There's actually a lot included in that. When we think about software, we're thinking, obviously, about software developers. But we think about cybersecurity, we think about interfacing with consumer devices and obviously, our sensor partners and potentially other diabetes technologies. We obviously think about mobile technology, cloud computing and data science. So there's just a lot wrapped into that. We mentioned last year, we doubled our product development headcount and most -- or teams and most of that doubling took place, in fact, virtually all of it took place in some sort of software function. So we have been building rapidly. And I think I look back and think about where we are in our in these final stages of the clearance for Omnipod 5. And I think it's so great we made these investments, and we've built such dramatic capabilities here because it is a moat for others behind us to get really good at remote insulin delivery from either a PDM and/or mobile phones. Those are not easy to do. And then obviously, all of the integrations with our partners. I wouldn't say we're done. This is an area that will be continued investment for us for quite some time to come. We have no shortage of really exciting disruptive innovation programs ahead of us, and we will continue to invest here. And we've always said we'll get a little bit more maybe public about what those programs might look like as we think about once we've got Omnipod five into full market release. But areas of investment for us are, for example, continuing to advance our algorithms because that will provide ease of use, more automation and better outcomes continuing to interface with, obviously, additional sensors but also additional phone platforms, continuing to build value in digital. So things like data, insights and decision support and serving up, generating insights for patients, payers and clinicians. Just as some examples. So we've got work going on in all those areas. And I don't think that's going to slow down anytime soon, and we'll continue to build capabilities there. And then the second question around Omnipod five and covered lives. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the teams are doing a great job here. We're really encouraged by the discussions that have been being had by payers. We're definitely educating the pharmacy channel for the first time on automated insulin delivery and the value of Omnipod 5. Those conversations are going well. We already have some coverage established. And as we've always said, as the clinical data gets published, we expect more coverage. And then, of course, on clearance, we expect more coverage. And so we're building -- we're right where we expect to be at this point. Really, really delighted with the team's work and really optimistic that we're going to launch with a decent coverage position. And also build very rapidly from there. So that -- and all of our tactics are really designed to make that happen. The ones that I mentioned in my script around leveraging the data, pricing at parity, all of that is designed to make sure that we establish rapid access. Operator : I show our next question comes from the line of Ravi Misra from Berenberg Capital. Ravi Misra : So I guess I just want to step back to the broader diabetes landscape, if I may, for a second. Becton announced that it's spinning off its business this morning in the diabetes world. And just looking at their revenue numbers and their kind of focus, can you maybe think about or maybe help us think about how you think about kind of where we are progressing as an industry? I mean, to me, I would think perhaps it's a signal that pumps are the way given that this is a business with flattish revenue focused on needles. But just curious to see how you guys are thinking about it up there. Shacey Petrovic : Sure. Yes, Ravi, good question. I mean I think you're right. We certainly believe and we've been very public about our belief that this market will double and that we're going to take a very exciting position in this fast-growing market and that is being driven by so many things. We've talked about what's been happening with CGM adoption. It's actually almost breathtaking when you look back five years and think about what's happened to the blood glucose monitoring business and what's happened with CGM. It's been a pretty remarkable transformation in the market and the value of real-time CGM data and what that has meant in terms of technology integration and technology adoption among pump therapy. And that is, I would say, still maturing in type one and at the very, very early stages in type 2. And so I do think, potentially, you could look at that move as just an endorsement of where the market is heading from a pump utilization, technology utilization perspective, both CGM and pumps, really when you look at their business. And I think we feel very well positioned in terms of specifically patch pumps. There's been a lot of activity out there, players trying to get into patch pumps. BD is one of them. And so I think it also points to how hard what we do is and how well positioned we are. And when you think about the challenge it takes to do something like we do with Omnipod, just the incredible investment that it takes to serve this market, it is about our IP position. It is about the incredible manufacturing capability. But it's also about what it takes to serve the commercial market and build the brand and create awareness, et cetera. And that's an area where a player, for example, like BD just didn't have a strong commercial presence there. So I think it's -- from our perspective, we feel very well positioned in a market that is growing very rapidly. And that's going to happen, I think, explosively in type 1, and we're just at the beginning stages in type 2. So it's a long tail from here, and we feel very well positioned in that space. Operator : I show our next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone from Jefferies. Anthony Petrone : Quick two part t question on Omnipod 5. I guess, is there a way to maybe sort of look at the existing Omnipod user base and how it's segmented between BGM and CGM? And how do you see those individual patient populations over time gravitating to O5. Does one trend faster than the other? Or does everyone sort of converge on an integrated basis? And then if you have any early opinion on retention specifically, how do you see retention on O5 versus a stand-alone Omnipod user trending once the cycle begins? Shacey Petrovic : Great. Thanks, Anthony. So maybe I'll take the retention one first, just to say that our retention has been very stable. So I think that's a great thing, just especially when you think about how dynamic the market is with new innovations coming. It's great to see that our retention has been stable. And I would expect that to likely be the same with Omnipod 5, primarily because we have done so much work on the access front. And because we're focused on establishing broad affordable access for Omnipod 5, we know that, that is one of the major reasons for people trading off the product as tied to access and cost. And so we have prioritized that with DASH, frankly, and then now with Omnipod 5. And I believe that's one of the drivers behind the stability in our retention for patients. As it relates to our user base and who's going to convert more quickly, BGM or CGM users, we certainly see CGM users as a very logical target for this. And we've said in the past, that's about half of our population. So that's great. But honestly, I think this product is going to be a winner with our patient-based period. There's a lot of exciting benefits around phone control, et cetera. And when I think about what's been happening with our user base, CGM adoption has grown very rapidly. So every day, that number ticks up a little bit and then that target population becomes even bigger for Omnipod 5. And that's certainly the trend across the United States. And so we've got a really big, exciting target for Omnipod five and a really exciting product to bring to those people. Operator : I show our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Brien from Piper Sandler. Unidentified Analyst : This is Korinne on for Matt. So just on the 30-day trial that you're doing, how quickly do you think that will shift over to Omnipod 5? Will that be immediately once you launch it? Are you still going to be using DASH for a little bit? And then just on that topic as well, how many patients are you seeing actually stay on Omnipod after doing this trial? Is there a way to quantify that yet? Shacey Petrovic : Yes. Korinne, great question. So we won't stop doing 30 Days of Freedom for DASH. This is part of our great position that we have with our business model to be able to essentially sample the product where others can't. And so it's a tactic to help drive more people who are sitting on multiple daily injections, injecting themselves four to five times a day, really be able to get over the hurdle of trying a new technology. It's been wildly successful for us. The vast majority of people who use the 30 Days of Freedom trial stay on the product. So it's been a successful tactic for us and one we will continue. And we will likely offer that once we move into full market release. So once we have broader access established for Omnipod five is when we will start to offer that with Omnipod 5. But we'll offer it with both. Remember that Omnipod five is indicated for type 1. We still anticipate great utilization and growth among certain type one segments as well as obviously the type two user. And so we'll offer them both free trials. Operator : I show our next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor from UBS. Matt Taylor : I just had one on phasing. We know that the pandemic depression of new starts is still having an impact here in Q2, but now you've had a couple of quarters of record new starts. Could you just help us think about how that will start to roll in? And does that help you start to inflect more here in the second half? And any other nuances to help understand the gating over the quarters? Wayde McMillan : Yes, Matt. And it is a unique dynamic with our annuity model. And so it definitely makes sense to spend a little more time on that. And you're referencing the U.S., first of all, I would say, just at the high level, we do think that we're through the majority of the pandemic impact in the U.S. We turned the corner at the end of 2020. And we're now, as you said, in more of an acceleration mode. We had record new customer starts in Q4. Again, here a record for Q1 in the U.S. And so what that positions us for is the strong 23% growth in Q1 with a very tough comp in Q2, still in the high-teens, 20% range. But what that does specific to your question, Matt, is it positions us for that 24% to 28% growth rate in the second half and starts to get us into the high-20% growth rates. And we haven't been in the 30% growth rate since before the pandemic. A couple of quarters before the pandemic, we were 30%. As the annuity continues to build here, we're confident that we'll get into the mid- to high-20s. And then just to touch on international because it is a different dynamic. I mentioned earlier, pandemic persisting longer. And so we will take a little longer to build the momentum back up again internationally. But we've got confidence that we'll do that and we expect international to be high-teens, low-20s nearing the end of this year and after we get on the other side of the pandemic next year. Operator : Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time in the queue. I would like to turn the call back over to Shacey Petrovic for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Shacey Petrovic : Thank you. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. There is just so much to be excited about at Insulet, and there's much more we can and will accomplish for our customers. We have passionate employees, transformative innovations and a differentiated business model to continue to displace legacy therapies and to simplify and improve the lives of people with diabetes. Thank you all, and have a great evening. Operator : Thank you for attending today's conference call. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect. Good day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Insulet Corporation Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President and Investor Relations. Deborah Gordon : Thank you, Dalam. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for Insulet\u2019s second quarter 2021 earnings call. With me today are Shacey Petrovic, President and Chief Executive Officer and Wayde McMillan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Both the replay of this call and the press release discussing our second quarter 2021 results and full year 2021 guidance will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during this call may be forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such statements. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely adjusted EBITDA and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth excluding the effect of foreign exchange. These measures align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance and we believe that are helpful to investors, analysts and other interested parties as measures of our operating performance from period to period. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis with the exception of revenue growth rates, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis. With that, I will turn the call over to Shacey. Shacey Petrovic : Thank you, Deb. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. We have reached the midpoint of the year and continue to deliver solid financial and operational performance and the underlying fundamentals of our business are strong. We\u2019ve maintained sharp focus on executing our strategy and driving growth and have sustained momentum across our business. Our outlook is also strong and we are on track to deliver another year of double-digit revenue growth, including meaningful acceleration during the second half. During the second quarter, we achieved 13% revenue growth, including total Omnipod growth of 16%. Our results met our expectations despite a headwind from higher-than-anticipated rebate adjustments in the U.S. pharmacy channel. Absent these, we drove revenue results both in terms of volume growth and mix benefit that exceeded our expectations. We also achieved another quarterly record of U.S. and global Omnipod new customer starts, which gives us great confidence and enthusiasm for Insulet\u2019s future. While our team remains squarely focused on Omnipod 5 clearance efforts, we made terrific progress across each of our strategic imperatives. We expanded coverage and volume growth of Omnipod DASH in the pharmacy, drove continued adoption in the Type 2 market where we are uniquely positioned, once again drove strong MDI conversions and presented compelling clinical data at the ATTD and ADA conferences. These accomplishments demonstrate both the success we\u2019re having unlocking the Type 2 market with our innovative product and business model, and the acceleration we expect in the Type 1 market with the launch of Omnipod 5. We have delivered consistently strong performance in these critical areas without an automated insulin delivery system in the market, which speaks to the power of Omnipod, the unique advantages of our pay-as-you-go business model and the differentiated customer experience we provide. Regarding our Omnipod 5 AID system, we are in the final stages of the FDA review process and are incredibly appreciative of the agency\u2019s diligence and collaboration, particularly given the pandemic workload. While we continue to expect FDA clearance and limited market release in the second half of 2021, we believe Q3 clearance is unlikely and now estimate that both will happen later in the fourth quarter. We remain incredibly excited about what Omnipod 5 will offer the diabetes community. Our market position, which is already strong, will be greatly enhanced by the introduction of Omnipod 5. We are well prepared, have invested in our sales teams, expanded our manufacturing capacity and made great progress securing payer support. Our efforts in these areas will continue as we work through the final stages of the clearance process. We are confident in a successful launch of Omnipod 5, and I will share more on that in a few minutes. I will now speak to each of our strategic imperatives, including expanding access and awareness, delivering consumer-focused innovation, growing our global addressable market and driving operational excellence. Beginning with access and awareness, the global diabetes market is growing rapidly, with millions of people expected to be newly diagnosed this year alone and rapid adoption of CGM among people living with Type 1 diabetes and more recently, Type 2 diabetes. Despite such a large and fast growing market, it remains critically underserved, and awareness of and access to technology remain far too low. We continue to expand access and utilization through the pharmacy, which provides a better customer experience, a more efficient channel for physicians and for Insulet. In the second quarter, we grew Omnipod DASH U.S. covered lives to approximately 80%, a sizable sequential increase. This drove a notable increase of U.S. volume through the pharmacy in Q2. Omnipod DASH continues to be our primary growth driver, with the majority of our new customers across the globe starting on this system. Approximately 80% of our U.S. new customer starts are consistently driven by MDI conversions, and a percentage of our U.S. new customers that were Type 2 during the second quarter remained strong at 35% to 40%, even with the record-setting growth in new customer starts. In the Type 1 segment, historically large numbers of MDI users are adopting technology, which gives us continued confidence that AID will drive a doubling of the pump market in the coming years. We are pleased with our current growth in Type 1, which is a testament to Omnipod\u2019s differentiation. And as we look ahead to Omnipod 5, we expect to be extremely well positioned to accelerate growth in this segment. We are also successfully driving adoption among Type 2 users, a large market segment that has tremendous long-term growth potential, particularly as CGM becomes more widely adopted. We are learning that Omnipod is uniquely well suited for Type 2 users. Because awareness of Omnipod remains low, we are investing to raise awareness across the globe. We are advancing our direct-to-consumer advertising campaign in the U.S., as well as our pilot program in Europe, primarily in the United Kingdom. While our DTC efforts remain in early stages, the response has been encouraging in all markets where we\u2019ve tested it. And we believe DTC is a contributing factor that helped to drive record U.S. and global new customer starts this past quarter. Our growth is also supported by our superior technology, robust innovation pipeline and expanding clinical evidence that shows how life-changing Omnipod can be for people living with diabetes. The tube-free Omnipod experience is unique, and we know from our clinical trial participants that Omnipod 5 will be a transformative product for Insulet and for the diabetes community. We cannot wait to bring it to market. We are making good progress in this regard, and our recent interactions with the FDA continue to give us confidence in a second half limited market release. A third quarter FDA clearance is unlikely, so we now estimate clearance will be later in the fourth quarter. Through our ongoing collaborations as part of the breakthrough devices program, among other things, the FDA has provided clarity on open questions related to full smartphone control. Based on their feedback, we are updating our smartphone app to add a product feature, and we are working through the final steps towards clearance. This work is well underway and gives us confidence in our expected clearance timing. Insulet is a pioneer in this space with full phone control and we are grateful for the agency\u2019s support and guidance and delighted to be close to clearance. Achieving full smartphone control is a complex and novel innovation that we know will be enthusiastically welcomed by our customers. We are committed to providing the best possible user experience and getting Omnipod 5 to market as quickly as possible. While we work through to clearance, our teams are successfully securing pharmacy coverage for Omnipod 5, testing all elements of our customer experience and preparing for a successful limited market release. No other product on the market delivers the value, technology and functionality of Omnipod 5. We believe it will significantly change the lives of people with diabetes and their caregivers through unparalleled ease of use, better quality of life and improved outcomes. From a commercial perspective, we previously communicated the core components of our pricing and access strategies. In the U.S., Omnipod 5 will be available only through the pharmacy, and it will be priced at parity with Omnipod DASH. We will continue to provide no upfront costs and no long-term lock-in period. In addition, any customer, whether an MDI or tubed pump user will be able to try Omnipod 5 for free at any time through our 30 Days of Freedom program, which has already helped to fuel increased Omnipod adoption. Given this approach, we expect the low monthly out-of-pocket costs for Omnipod 5 will be comparable to Omnipod DASH and MDI, which we believe is a tremendous value given the improved outcomes and quality of life Omnipod 5 delivers. The majority of our Omnipod DASH customers in the U.S. have a monthly pharmacy co-pay of under $50, and we are thrilled to offer the same benefit to our Omnipod 5 customers. We have already contracted more coverage for Omnipod 5 than what Omnipod DASH had after commercial launch, setting us up for a successful limited market release. The value Omnipod 5 can deliver to people with diabetes is clear, as demonstrated by the compelling clinical data we recently shared at major diabetes conferences, including Omnipod 5 preschool pivotal and pivotal extension results and our non-AID system data. While we are proud of all the impressive Omnipod data, our Omnipod 5 preschool pivotal data certainly stands out. Our study represented the largest data set of primary outcomes for any AID system down to age 2. The results were compelling and included a statistically significant overall A1c reduction, a significant increase in time and range and no severe adverse events. 100% of the preschool participants moved into the extension phase, which shows these families did not want to give up their systems. This clearly speaks to the tremendous value children and their parents experience on Omnipod 5. The results mirrored Omnipod 5\u2019s strong performance across other age groups, including up to age 70. This is quite an accomplishment as many experts agree the pediatric age group is the most challenging for clinical care. The results also demonstrated a significant improvement in sleep for caregivers. It\u2019s a very common concern for concerned parents. We are so pleased to see these young children greatly benefit from our technology. They are often unable to verbalize how they are feeling and are too young to manage this complicated disease on their own. We believe Omnipod 5 will greatly ease the burden of diabetes for these vulnerable children and their caregivers. Another major highlight of our pivotal extension was the further reduction in A1C levels because they already were significantly reduced during the first pivotal phase. To see a greater reduction speaks to the durable power of Omnipod 5 to transform diabetes management. While we are proud of all of our clinical results, there is much more to do, and we will continue to invest in our clinical road map, including expanding Omnipod 5\u2019s indication down to H2 and for Type 2. Our preschool internal clinical efforts are advancing well, yet our FDA submission is contingent upon the timing of Omnipod 5 clearance. We are now planning for this expanded indication in 2022. Additionally, our Type 2 feasibility study is advancing. We recently concluded the 3-month study period and are now in the extension phase. We expect to share the results of our Type 2 study at an upcoming conference. Finally, while the upcoming clearance and launch of Omnipod 5 remain our top priorities, our pipeline is robust, and we believe some of our best innovations are yet to come. As such, investing in our software development, data science and other capabilities remain a critical priority. Our development work is well underway, including iOS and Libre integrations, the international launch of Omnipod 5 and database innovations aimed at providing insights for our customers. Beyond Omnipod 5, we are developing technologies that we believe will simplify and improve the lives of people living with both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Turning to global expansion, we have spent the last few years working to expand awareness and access to Omnipod across our key international markets. Our latest efforts have been in Australia, where we continue to plan for an Omnipod DASH launch this year. This builds upon our expansion into Turkey earlier this year and across Europe and the Middle East last year. We expect our international expansion efforts will drive access to a huge global addressable market, far beyond the estimated 11 million to 12 million people living with insulin-dependent diabetes across our current global footprint. As we look ahead, we know there are additional opportunities to further expand our addressable market and to help improve the lives of people living with diabetes around the world. We continue to drive strong growth in our international markets with the recent full launch of Omnipod DASH, and we fully expect to bring Omnipod 5 to these markets in the future. Lastly, we continue to invest significantly to further strengthen and scale our global manufacturing operations. We are in a strong position to meet growing global demand for Omnipod DASH, support the upcoming U.S. release of Omnipod 5 and scale our operations to support our future innovation pipeline and geographic expansion initiatives. We\u2019ve made terrific strides on our path to build on our operational excellence, which we believe to be a critical enabler of sustainable revenue growth and margin expansion in the years ahead. In closing, we are on track to deliver another strong year of financial results and strategic progress, and we are gearing up for the upcoming launch of Omnipod 5. Our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes has never been more important, and our innovative solutions have never been more needed. I will now turn the call over to Wayde. Wayde McMillan : Thanks, Shacey. We achieved another solid quarter of financial results with building momentum from record global new customer starts and are on track to drive accelerated revenue growth in the second half of the year. To support our accelerating growth, we continue to invest in our strategic imperatives through innovation, clinical, commercial, manufacturing and other supporting functions that position us for sustainable, long-term global growth. We generated 13% revenue growth in the second quarter finishing within our guidance range, driven by total Omnipod growth of 16%. As expected, the pandemic\u2019s effect on 2020 global new customer starts impacted results again in Q2 given the annuity nature of our revenue model. Although the impact of the pandemic headwind continues to linger in the United States and is still more challenged in some of our international markets, we expect the major impact is largely behind us. In Q2, we delivered U.S. Omnipod revenue growth of 17%, which was at the low end of our expectations due to the higher-than-expected rebates from one of our largest pharmacy partners of approximately $4 million. Approximately half of the adjustment related to a rebate catch-up from prior to Q2. As a reminder, Q2 also had a tough comparison with approximately $4 million to $5 million of channel build in the prior year. During the second quarter, we continued to build our customer base with record U.S. new customer starts, ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption with both Type 1 and Type 2 customers and the mix benefit we realized as we drive increased volume through the pharmacy channel. These growth drivers continue to trend upward in Q2 as Omnipod DASH drove almost 80% of our U.S. new customer starts and we grew pharmacy channel volume to over 45% of our total U.S. volume. In Q2, international Omnipod revenue grew 13%, which finished slightly ahead of our expectations. Our growth in the quarter was driven by our success with Omnipod DASH in expanding our customer base throughout our markets, as well as the team\u2019s ability to successfully execute through continued COVID-19 challenges. Our global attrition and utilization remained stable during Q2. Drug delivery revenue declined 13% during the second quarter, finishing slightly ahead of our expectations. As a reminder, order volumes were elevated in the prior year as a result of the pandemic and are normalizing this year as expected. Gross margin was 69.4% in the second quarter, representing a 640 basis point increase or a 510 basis point increase on a constant currency basis. This expansion was in line with our expectations and marks our highest gross margin reported to date. Overall, our gross margin expansion continues to be driven by our improved manufacturing operations and supply chain efficiencies, lower COVID-related costs and the mix benefit of increasing volumes in the U.S. pharmacy channel. These benefits were partially offset by the expected higher mix of costs as we continue to ramp U.S. manufacturing, including our third highly automated U.S. line, which is now producing sellable product. Operating expenses were in line with expectations as we continued to invest in our robust innovation and clinical pipelines, the upcoming launch of Omnipod 5 and other commercial investments, including our global direct-to-consumer advertising initiatives and our international expansion plans. Operating margin was 10%, down 220 basis points, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.9%, up 40 basis points. Our operating income was in line with our expectations as we continue to invest throughout our global business to fuel our long-term growth trajectory. Turning to cash and liquidity, we remain in a strong position with no near-term maturities and further runway to continue to invest in our business. We ended the quarter with $872 million in cash and short-term investments. We have also taken a number of steps to strengthen our capital structure, including successfully executing a $500 million Term Loan B financing. We used the proceeds to repurchase 92% of our convertible notes due 2024, which resulted in a $40 million loss on extinguishment that is excluded from adjusted EBITDA. Additional notes were since converted and now approximately 3% of the original issuance remains outstanding. Following these transactions, on an annual basis, we expect our net cash interest expense will be approximately $30 million and non-cash interest expense will be significantly reduced to approximately $25 million to $30 million. Now turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are maintaining our full year revenue guidance of 16% to 20%, including total Omnipod revenue growth of 18% to 21%. We continue to expect a full year U.S. Omnipod revenue growth range of 22% to 25%. We expect our growth to be driven primarily by expanding Omnipod DASH volume, increased access and awareness, our differentiated pay-as-you-go model, and the mix benefit in the pharmacy channel. In addition, we expect further penetration and customer adoption in both the Type 1 and Type 2 markets. Partially offsetting these tailwinds are less Omnipod 5 incremental revenue than we had previously anticipated and the Q2 rebate adjustment. For international Omnipod, we continue to expect full year 2021 revenue growth in a range of 11% to 15%. Omnipod DASH adoption rates continue to grow following its launch near the end of last year. Despite the lingering impact of COVID across several of our markets during the first half of 2021, our team has successfully driven additional market penetration and strong new customer growth. The runway to expand Omnipod adoption across our international markets is large, and we see clear pathways for future growth. As a reminder, we had a tough comp due to the $8 million to $9 million of pandemic-related inventory we experienced in the prior year as well as from our initial launch of Omnipod DASH. Lastly, we are maintaining our expectations for drug delivery revenue in a range of 11% decrease to a 4% increase. Turning to gross margin, we now expect full year gross margin to be in the range of 68% to 69%. The core drivers of our gross margin expansion have not changed as we build scale and create efficiencies throughout our global manufacturing operations, as well as the ongoing benefits of volume shift into the U.S. pharmacy channel. In addition, we expect to benefit from lower COVID-related costs. We continue to expect operating expenses will largely rise in line with revenue growth this year. We view the investments in consumer-focused innovation, our sales and marketing teams and our international expansion efforts as critical to our long-term growth profile. We are reaffirming full year operating margin in the low double digits range. Our operating margin expansion will be driven by our strong top line growth and gross margin improvements as well as our expectation that the onetime costs that occurred in the fourth quarter of last year will not recur this year. On a sequential basis, we expect operating margin improvements throughout the second half of this year primarily due to our expected accelerated revenue growth. We continue to expect capital expenditures to increase this year with the investments throughout our global manufacturing operations, as well as our strategic initiatives. Turning to our third quarter 2021 guidance, we expect total company revenue growth of 11% to 18%. This includes total Omnipod revenue growth of 17% to 23%. We expect Q3 U.S. Omnipod revenue growth of 23% to 28%. As a reminder, Q3 growth also benefits from the net impact of estimated distributor channel destocking last year. The significant step-up in our sequential growth rate is primarily due to the impact of channel stocking and destocking in the prior year, volume ramp from our accumulating record-setting new customer start quarters, annualizing the most impactful COVID-19 related quarters from 2020 and, to a lesser degree, the mix benefit from volume through the pharmacy channel. We expect Q3 international Omnipod revenue growth of 8% to 14%. We continue to expect our growth rate to be partially offset by the trailing pandemic-related headwinds that existed in the second half of 2020 and the first half of this year in many of our international markets. Also, as a reminder, Q3 growth is impacted by the estimated 4 million to 5 million distributor channel stocking we experienced in the third quarter of last year, ahead of the international full market release of Omnipod DASH. We expect drug delivery revenue to decline 40% to 28% due to the normalization of order volumes as compared to elevated levels in the prior year resulting from the pandemic. In conclusion, we have sustained momentum throughout the business and are on track to deliver another year of strong revenue growth and margin expansion while advancing our strategic imperatives. Our financial position is sound and provides us the flexibility to invest in our leading innovation pipeline, access and awareness initiatives, global sales force, international expansion and manufacturing efficiencies. All of these efforts are designed to drive significant shareholder value over the long-term and strengthen our ability to improve the lives of people with diabetes across the globe. With that, we will turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Travis Steed from Barclays. Please go ahead. Travis Steed : Hi, thanks for the questions. I missed part of the prepared remarks, so apologies, but I did want to get more color on the Omnipod 5 Pod delay. And just to make sure I understand all the moving parts there, what exactly happened and what gives you confidence that you are going to have the approval by Q4? Shacey Petrovic : Sure, Travis. Yes, I appreciate the question. I think it may be helpful to take a step back to where we were in May. We had received the agencies\u2019 feedback on our submission, and there were no surprises, which had put us on track for our anticipated timeline. We are very fortunate to be a part of the breakthrough devices program, and that allows us frequent collaboration with the agency. So we took the opportunity to discuss in more detail full mobile phone control and get extreme clarity on the FDA\u2019s response. Their feedback was really helpful for us and valuable and it prompted us to update our app with a feature that we believe will improve the customer experience. So that is basically what\u2019s happened since May. And the work is well underway, including all of our verification and validation testing. And then our assessment of that final work and the FDA\u2019s review and then, of course, some buffer because times are not normal given the COVID work load, that all puts us towards a Q4, we believe, late in Q4 clearance and limited market release. So that\u2019s kind of where we are. I would just emphasize that in the meantime, we are not standing still, the teams are doing great work preparing for a limited market release and I think making really good use of the time that we have while we get to final clearance. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Larry Biegelsen : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess if I am going to use my one question on Omnipod 5, I will ask what is the final feature Shacey? And I guess when do you plan to submit that to FDA? And just given the delays there, what gives you confidence and what\u2019s the buffer that you are incorporating to get to that late Q4 clearance? Thanks for taking the question. Shacey Petrovic : Sure. Yes. Thanks, Larry. The feature is related to full smartphone control. So it\u2019s the way that the app interacts with the system. It has nothing to do with our core system or our algorithm, which we know delivered outstanding clinical results across the broadest age range of any AID pivotal study. So nothing that will impact system functionality, but it is something that we believe will deliver a better customer experience. And I think, ultimately, this feedback was helpful for us. What gives us confidence when we think about the limited market release in Q4 is our interactions with the agency. We\u2019ve factored in all of the work that we have underway plus review time and plus buffer. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful to provide exactly the amount of buffer, but what I will say is we\u2019ve learned a lot because we\u2019ve been under review for quite some time, all while the pandemic has been underway as well. So, we do understand how long the back and forth has been taking, how much longer that\u2019s been than traditional timelines, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve factored in that points us to Q4. So I think it\u2019s really those interactions that give us that confidence. And we have cleared an enormous amount of hurdles. Up until this time, we really believe we are in the final stages here and remain confident in a second half, but like we said, end of Q4, limited market release and clearance. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Robbie Marcus : Great. Thanks. Two for me. I will ask them both upfront. One on the pharmacy rebate, I was hoping you could just go into a little more detail of exactly what that was and how it worked. Was that \u2013 did you over-earn from this \u2013 from this payer and now you are rebating it back? Is it one-time? How do we think about that? And any further impacts you expect going forward? And then second on the U.S., the results are obviously better when you put the rebate back in. But it would be great to hear what you\u2019re seeing out in the field. Do you think people are holding back on starting Omnipod as they are waiting for Omnipod 5, I am sure they hear it in the news, just thinking about how it\u2019s impacting the field if at all? Thanks. Wayde McMillan : Sure, right. If you want, I can start that one, Shacey, on the rebate question, and glad you brought it up, Robbie, because it gives us an opportunity to share a little bit more color around it. It is due to an updated rebate information from one of our largest pharmacy partners. So as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, that partially related to prior to Q2 and it\u2019s a year-to-date catch-up, and that result changed our rebate expectations as well. So our pharmacy partners have several quarters in arrears to correct their rebate submissions, and we have a wide range of rebate percentage programs and as we execute our strategy and ramp our business in the pharmacy. So we anticipate variability in the rebates. However, this one was much larger than expected. It\u2019s really a growing pain for both of us. It\u2019s new for us, and it\u2019s new for our pharmacy partners. So as they set up our agreements and process rebates for us, this will settle down over time. Once we get a majority of our business in the pharmacy and get more established, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see this type of variability going forward. Although the net rebate this quarter ends up much higher than expected, it doesn\u2019t change our strategy in the pharmacy. It is a significant differentiation for us and better for our customers. So as the pharmacy channel becomes a larger portion of our revenue, rebates will be one of the metrics that could impact our results going forward. And we do \u2013 given the rebate percentage difference there, see some variability. In relation to guidance, it is a metric that we factor into both the high end and the low end. Shacey Petrovic : Great. Thanks, Wayde. Yes, I think important to emphasize that pharmacy is a strategic pillar for us. And for all, I think Wayde mentioned the reason, obviously, it\u2019s a better customer experience, but it\u2019s also a more efficient channel for physicians and for Insulet, and that\u2019s really important as we as we get ready to scale with the launch of Omnipod 5. And then your question, Robbie, on what are we hearing in the field. The one thing I would say is behind the numbers, it\u2019s just important and sometimes it gets lost because of the business model. But behind the numbers, we had a record new patient start quarter. So that\u2019s important as we think about are people holding off? It certainly would not be evident in our numbers based on new customer starts in this past quarter. And that said, you\u2019re right that there is growing consumer awareness of Omnipod 5. The company and I personally get daily e-mails from customers that are anxiously waiting. So I don\u2019t believe customers are holding off based on the new customer starts numbers, but there is growing awareness of the technology that\u2019s coming. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy from SVB Leerink. Please go ahead. Danielle Antalffy : Hi, good afternoon everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. And I don\u2019t know if this is for Wayde or Shacey, or maybe both of you. But I guess with the approval for Omnipod 5 now coming later this year, consensus pre-today was looking at like 20% growth in 2022. So a slight acceleration if you\u2019re looking at the midpoint of the range. I mean you\u2019re talking about still a limited market release for Omnipod 5. I\u2019d just be curious what you can say about how the change in the timeline for Omnipod 5 might impact the outlook for 2022, if at all, and how that accelerating growth via the consensus numbers again, pre-today, how achievable that might be? Thanks so much. Shacey Petrovic : Yes. Thanks, Danielle. Maybe I\u2019ll kick us off, and then Wayde can give some comments on any color he wants to give regarding 2022 with Omnipod 5. I think ultimately, we know that the market is waiting for Omnipod 5. So we\u2019re going to do whatever we can to make our limited market release as efficient as possible. It\u2019s important to do a limited market release. If you think about what\u2019s going to happen with Omnipod 5, we know that people today who use DASH or classic Omnipod or multiple daily injections or tubed pumps, they are all going to have a different customer journey coming on to Omnipod 5. They are each different pathways, and we will have different requirements. For example, all our DASH customers already know the benefits of pharmacy and low out-of-pocket costs. We\u2019re going to have to get two pump users or potentially MDI users comfortable with the benefits of the pharmacy and then each of those different patient segments have different training and onboarding needs. And so those are the types of customer experiences that we\u2019re testing today to make sure that we\u2019ve got everything in a great position for the launch. And then the other governor is access. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why we gave some color that the team is making great progress establishing access. So we are doing everything that we can to make as efficient an LMR as possible. But we do want to do one. And hopefully, we \u2013 well, not hopefully, today, for sure, we are in a better position today than we were a quarter ago. And a quarter from now, we\u2019re going to be in an even stronger position. So I think we\u2019re going to head into 2022 in a really strong position and hopefully keep the LMR as efficient as possible. Wayde McMillan : Yes. And just picking up on the guidance part of the question there, Danielle, we aren\u2019t guiding to 2022 yet. But can certainly appreciate the question. And we can provide some color on how we\u2019re thinking about the U.S. guidance for \u201822 at this point in time. 2022 is going to be a strong year for us. And we will include the ramp of Omnipod 5 in 2022. However, as you\u2019re asking about here, and as Shacey said in her prepared remarks, that with the LMR now starting most likely at the end of Q4, that we would expect that some portion of the LMR will extend into 2022 with full market release coming sometime later in 2022. And so we won\u2019t likely get a full year \u2013 a full market release in 2022 at this point, but it is going to be a very strong year for us. And so we\u2019re not going to comment specifically on guidance numbers or ranges at this point. A couple of other things to think about, the pandemic is always a consideration. And given our annuity model and the persistence of the pandemic here into 2021, it will be somewhat of a headwind for us in 2022. But we\u2019ve got a ways to go here throughout the rest of \u201821. We will see what the Delta variant and how warnings in some countries and some of the challenges that are coming out impact us. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be free and clear of it yet in 2022. But let\u2019s see how things progress through the rest of 2021. And then as usual, we will give our guidance in the Q1 call. We do have other tailwinds and growth drivers that are accelerating here into the second half, and that momentum will carry into 2022. Further DASH penetration, the Type 1 and Type 2 customer adoption really being aided by CGM, so we\u2019re riding that wave as well. We\u2019re continuing to expand in the pharmacy with our pay-as-you-go model, our direct-to-consumer program. So, a lot of momentum in the business, quite a few tailwinds, a couple of headwinds that we are monitoring and that\u2019s some color for you, we will get into the 2022 guidance on our Q1 call. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Baird. Please go ahead. Jeff Johnson : Thank you, good afternoon guys. Let me just \u2013 Wayde or Shacey, I guess, either one follow-up on Danielle\u2019s question there and ask it maybe a slightly different way. When we thought Omnipod 5 was coming maybe midyear or so, it was kind of a 6-month limited market release. But Shacey, to your point, a lot of that, I think, was getting commercial coverage in place, and it sounds like you\u2019re making good progress there. Is it fair to think about that LMR then could be cut in half? Think about it as one quarter and then moving by second quarter into that full market release? And Wayde, I know \u2013 respect that you\u2019re not giving \u201822 guidance, but it feels like there should be some shortening of that LMR schedule given the commercial coverage you\u2019ve already established? Thanks. Shacey Petrovic : Yes. Thanks, Jeff. We are going to do everything that we can to drive as efficient in a limited market release as possible. I think just something to keep in mind is limited market releases are designed to uncover things that weren\u2019t contemplated in all of the testing and launch preparation. So I think that\u2019s the caution. Of course, we are in a stronger position. We\u2019re securing coverage. I think all of this sets us up for success and in trying to shorten the limited market release. But I caution everybody by saying, if we bump into something we are going to address that. That\u2019s the whole purpose of doing a limited market release. I think the teams are doing great work, and certainly ameliorating the potential of running into something with all of the work that we\u2019re doing, and we are certainly establishing access, which is one of the main governors. And so those are great signs. But I don\u2019t \u2013 of course, we\u2019re going to take our learnings from the limited market release, and we\u2019re going to make sure that we\u2019re providing the best possible customer experience. Operator : I show our next question comes from the line of Matthew O\u2019Brien from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Matthew O\u2019Brien: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I know everybody is focused on the 5, slippage here. But I\u2019m curious about the core business. And to your point, Shacey, that the growth in new patients was the record that you saw. Can you talk a little bit more about some of the dynamics there that are driving new patient additions so much higher if it\u2019s Type 2s, if it\u2019s pediatrics. Just talk about some of those dynamics and then how those might, may be augmented once you can get 5 on the market more so next year. Thank you. Shacey Petrovic : Yes, Matt, thanks for the question. Actually, I think it\u2019s really exciting to see what\u2019s happening with the core business right now. What\u2019s driving our growth? I would point to two \u2013 well, three dynamics. The first is DTC. So this investment that we\u2019re making in raising awareness is definitely working and we think was one of the drivers for our record \u2013 by quite a bit in the U.S. new patient starts. And that\u2019s coming broadly across Type 1, primarily among multiple daily injection users and then also Type 2. And so Type 2 would be the second dynamic that I would point to. We are in a pretty rarified position here. Nobody else is having the success that we\u2019re having unlocking this market opportunity. And it\u2019s because we have a product that is uniquely well suited to the Type 2 user in its simplicity and in its cost profile. And so that\u2019s the third piece, is the pharmacy and pay-as-you-go. And that\u2019s helping certainly to make our technology more accessible and more affordable to the people that are becoming increasingly aware of it. And the reason why we like these dynamics, these underlying dynamics is because when we launch Omnipod 5, it will be additive to these things. We are \u2013 we fully intend to maintain our advantage in Type 2. We fully intend to maintain our advantage in the pharmacy and our pay-as-you-go model. And we\u2019re going to then deliver what we think will be a game-changing technology in Omnipod 5 to the market. And so the team could not be more excited because we\u2019ve got this underlying momentum that\u2019s being \u2013 that\u2019s helping to deliver record-setting new patient starts. And of course, we\u2019re all gearing up \u2013 every aspect of the company right now is gearing up for an Omnipod 5 launch and just incredibly excited about what it will bring to patients. So I think it\u2019s an exciting additive technology to what is already a really strong momentum in our business, particularly in the U.S. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Please go ahead. Margaret Kaczor : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to focus in on the pharmacy channel and kind of that increase in adoption this quarter. It does seem like it did pop up, certainly for new patient starts and perhaps for active users as well. So was there something different that you guys were doing to drive that uptake? Is it DTC? And I guess, as we look a year from now, where should we see that active base or is it just going to be a little bit more predetermined on the launch and timing of Omnipod 5? Thanks. Shacey Petrovic : Yes. Great question, Margaret. So there is a few things happening. One, we continue to tick up access, and that increased notably. And as we increase access then more people in our base have the opportunity to move into the pharmacy. So that\u2019s one piece of it. The second is DTC is definitely driving demand. And if you think about now, where Wayde mentioned at cumulative record-setting quarter, so three quarters where we\u2019ve got \u2013 in our new customer starts, I think on each of those quarters, between 70% and 80% of customers going directly into the pharmacy or directly on to DASH, the vast majority of that in the pharmacy. So that trend is just helping to drive more and more people into the pharmacy. I think in terms of where does this go, we fully expect to have the majority \u2013 or vast majority of our business in the pharmacy over the coming years. We do see Omnipod 5 as a big driver there. Omnipod 5 will be only available in the pharmacy. We know that there is growing demand among our existing users and also among the market. And so that will help us to continue to accelerate that move into the pharmacy. And I would also point to Type 2, all of our Medicare business is through the pharmacy. So as Type 2 grows, that is growing in the pharmacy, and that\u2019s a great thing. What pharmacy does by providing Omnipod at the same out-of-pocket cost as multiple daily injection, it\u2019s really remarkable for DASH today, and it\u2019s going to be even more remarkable for Omnipod 5 tomorrow. So, just really great cost effective therapy for our patients. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Jayson Bedford : Excuse me, good afternoon. I\u2019ve kind of been going in and out, so hopefully, this question isn\u2019t repetitive. But just on access, you mentioned that you\u2019re progressing on your contracting efforts with Omnipod 5. Any way you can frame where you are with contracting and does this make the launch less limited, if you will? Shacey Petrovic : Yes, Jayson, great question. So we \u2013 rather than giving details, just kind of conceptually where we are with access, we have more access established, more covered lives today with Omnipod 5 preceding launch than we did following launch with Omnipod DASH. So that puts us, I think, in a really strong position and a really nice trajectory as we get closer to launch. Every quarter, we establish more access for Omnipod 5. So as we get closer to launch, we\u2019re certainly not standing still, but the teams are making great use of this time. And I think to your point, that sets us up for a successful, and what we certainly hope, is a very efficient limited market release. Because we knew that there are two primary governors to limited market release, one is access. And as you note, the team is making great progress there. The other is customer experience. And that\u2019s the one where we can\u2019t really sort of say how quick that\u2019s going to be until we get into the throes of it. I think the team is doing a really nice job testing all of the different pathways, testing the training and onboarding processes, testing the benefits investigation, all of that stuff. But that\u2019s the type of thing that you really need live patients going through the process to test effectively. But that will be, I think, the primary governor as we look to move from limited market release into full market release, given how well we\u2019re doing with access. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Kyle Rose from Canaccord. Please go ahead. Kyle Rose : Great. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to ask just maybe a bit of a bigger picture question. I mean, Shacey, this is in the second or third time on these calls you talked about investments you\u2019re making in software. I think traditionally, we\u2019ve become more accustomed to products in med tech being more focused on tangible things, like widgets and insulin pumps that you can touch. Maybe help us understand how you think about, maybe not necessarily with O-5, but maybe the next generation of products that are going to be maybe more software focused. And just how that might change the patient and the physician experience of the technology and the value you\u2019re providing? Shacey Petrovic : Yes, Kyle, thank you for the question. I think a great opportunity to just talk about the position that we see ourselves in as it relates to patient data. Very few companies have access to the volume of data that Insulet will have with Omnipod 5. We had mentioned earlier on a previous call that we\u2019re putting SIM cards into our Omnipod 5 controllers. And then, of course, we will be offering full phone control, which means that we will have stream of real-time data coming off of a user that helps us understand how their continuous glucose is doing, helps us understand how they are interacting with the system. Helps us understand how much insulin is being delivered, when it\u2019s being suspended, when they are eating. And so that provides us with incredible potential to generate insights that can be valuable to our customers, to their clinicians and potentially to payers as well in population analytics. And so we see ourselves just really well positioned, because it\u2019s essentially a wearable technology that\u2019s providing real-time data that we believe can help us help people achieve better outcomes through a variety of mechanisms. So I think you\u2019ll hear us talk more about that as we get Omnipod 5 to market, how we see that and our role in that for our customers, including our consumers, our clinicians and our payers, but we do believe we\u2019re very well positioned to provide value here. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from Citi. Please go ahead. Joanne Wuensch : Good afternoon and thank you for taking the question. I think one of the things that I\u2019m hearing in the patterns of the questions tonight is, is there a positive thing that comes out of this delay? Does it mean you need to have a shorter limited launch? Does it maybe accelerate your Type 2 label or your product with Abbott\u2019s Libre? And is there any way to address that or is just everything is pushed back, call it, 6 months? Shacey Petrovic : Yes, Joanne, I think the positive thing that comes out of this is that the FDA has given us really valuable, helpful feedback that we think will ultimately enable us to deliver a product that is even better. But \u2013 and I also believe that the limited market release will be shorter as a result of this time that we\u2019ve had to establish coverage. So that is good. How much shorter? That will rely on us really testing the customer experience and understanding if we\u2019ve got learnings there that need to be incorporated or adjusted to. But the value that we\u2019ve been able to have during this time is just the opportunity to establish coverage and continue to test the customer experience. Both of those things should help us to deliver a more efficient limited market release. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Anthony Petrone : Thanks. I hope everyone is doing well. A question on just collaboration behind the scenes on Omnipod 5 with Dexcom, they had some bullish language on their earnings call in the past couple of days. So just wondering what level of collaboration is going on behind the scenes ahead of launch later this year. That would be the first question. And then the follow-up question would just be maybe a longer term, sort of, opinion and view on the automated insulin delivery space, how you see it evolving next 2 to 3 years when you consider that we now have multiple offerings, either on market or coming to market imminently? Thanks. Shacey Petrovic : Thanks, Anthony. Dexcom has been an outstanding partner, and it has been remarkable to see what they have done in the market and the value that they provided consumers. We really believe that they are helping to drive AID adoption, and so we could not be more excited for our combination offering. They have helped us across a number of fronts and collaboration has been incredibly strong. And obviously, they have an incredible technology. And so that combined with Omnipod and Omnipod 5, we think is going to be a game changer in the market. It will be a game changer in terms of patient experience and patient outcomes, and it will be a game changer in the market in terms of our position. So we\u2019re strong collaborators, strong partners today, and then, of course, working on G7 and future integration. And so that would be a really exciting part of our pipeline as well. In terms of the AID market, I think it\u2019s very exciting to see what\u2019s occurring out there. We see the trend in terms of CGM adoption among Type 1s. And what\u2019s happening now with AID gives us great confidence that among Type 1 users, the pump market will double. And a big part of that will be automated insulin delivery. Of course, we believe we\u2019re going to deliver the best to market and \u2013 or the best product to market. And I think the thing that gives us excitement is that we have been competing so effectively with our non-AID system. And so, people are choosing Omnipod even though there is no CGM integration, and despite the fact that we\u2019ve seen such dramatic uptake in CGM. So we think that we\u2019re going to see the real power of the form factor now that we\u2019ve got CGM integration and automated insulin delivery with Omnipod 5, because people will no longer really have a reason to choose an alternative device, which we know many people \u2013 if they prefer the pod form factor but choose another system because of Dexcom integration. And so we\u2019re really excited to even the playing ground there and really frankly leapfrog the field there. And then the other thing I would point to is just Type 2. All of these trends are more mature in Type 1. And I talk sometimes about the competitive field, but I would say that among this large patient population, no one really needs to lose for us to win. They are \u2013 if you look at the field, even in Type 1 where there is more maturity here, still today, somewhere north of third of patients are using pump therapy. So there is a great opportunity for all of us to impact patient outcomes and provide better technology, better care for people living with Type 1 diabetes. The same trends are just burgeoning among Type 2. And so we\u2019re really excited about our position there, and we expect that both CGM and certainly Omnipod 5 and integrated devices are going to grow among Type 2 users too over the coming years. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Ravi Misra from Berenberg. Please go ahead. Ravi Misra : Hi, thanks for taking the question. Good evening. So just kind of maybe jumping on that last question, a little bit more big picture. You said earlier potential doubling of the pump market. I\u2019m just curious, there is a lot of things going on here with access and new technologies and telemedicine that could kind of support that kind of statement. But just what do you think is, if I can kind of put it philosophically, just curious what do you think still needs work on in terms of getting us from that 35% to 40% today, to maybe significant majority of insulin delivery through pumps that\u2019s not in existence right now, but something that is in your control? Thanks. Shacey Petrovic : Ravi, I think you highlighted quite a few of them. When you talk about new technology and access, I would say for both of those, it is just how simple can we make both of those. How simple can we make the technology so that it can be easily and enthusiastically adopted by the masses, and how simple can we make access. Because still today, Omnipod has changed the game with pay-as-you-go in the pharmacy and we\u2019ve made it simpler. But still today, there is too many hurdles for people to get on to these technologies, and that\u2019s something we are committed to continuing to work to eliminate. So I would point to simplicity and technology, simplicity and access. And the last thing I would point to is awareness. And we\u2019re really seeing it with DTC. We\u2019re investing in awareness. And we\u2019re probably making a big impact in the market and helping everybody at the end of the day because we\u2019re increasing patients\u2019 awareness to technology. But what we saw before we invested in DTC was that patients awareness, even a Type 2 consumers\u2019 awareness of their options, unaided awareness, was somewhere around 15%. So even a person with Type 1 could only name a pump manufacturer 15% of the time. So there is a massive opportunity here to just help people understand and gain more awareness to the treatment options that are available to them. And then we need to make them cost-effective and simple to access and to use. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Steve Lichtman from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Steve Lichtman : Thank you. Shacey, I was wondering if you could talk about international. What are the biggest incremental drivers we should be focused on for you guys internationally over the next, say, 6 to 12 months? Is it \u2013 whether it\u2019s in terms of new countries or particular countries where DASH has recently launched and anything you can talk about relative to potential timing of Omnipod 5 outside of the U.S.? Thanks. Shacey Petrovic : Yes. Thanks, Steve. When we think about international and the drivers there, DASH and continued expansion internationally will be drivers, particularly the adoption of Omnipod DASH, which we know is doing really well across our international markets, but room to continue to grow there. And new market additions, so now in the last year or so, we\u2019ve added a handful of markets that will contribute over time. But any new market addition, for us internationally, takes time to accumulate new users. It\u2019s just the way that our business model works. So we view international as a long-term growth driver, and we will continue to invest in expanding into new markets that will drive growth over time. We, of course, also are really excited to bring Omnipod 5 to our international markets, which we view as the next growth driver. We aren\u2019t going to give a timeline on that yet. We really want to get Omnipod 5 to market first in the U.S., and then we will update our timelines on things that everybody is asking about, iOS integration, Libre integration, G7 and international. But all of that work, every program I just mentioned is underway. And certainly, we\u2019re going to aim to follow as quickly as we can once we get Omnipod 5 to market in the U.S., which we could not be more excited to do. Operator : Thank you. I\u2019m showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Shacey Petrovic for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Shacey Petrovic : Great. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As you can see, we continue to drive our strategy forward, and we have great momentum throughout the business and real confidence in our outlook. We are halfway through the year and what we expect will be another successful year for Insulet. The clinical evidence we shared speaks to the tremendous value our technology offers to those living with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. And we could just not be more excited for the launch of Omnipod 5, because we are confident it will mark an important new chapter for Insulet and, more importantly, for those living with diabetes worldwide. Thanks so much. Have a great evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today to Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Deborah Gordon : Thank you, Dalam. Good afternoon and thank you for joining Insulet\u2019s third quarter 2021 earnings call. With me today are Shacey Petrovic, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Wayde McMillan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bret Christensen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, is also with us today for the Q&A portion of our call. Both, the replay of this call and the press release discussing our 2021 third quarter results and guidance will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such statements. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely adjusted EBITDA and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth excluding the effect of foreign exchange. These measures align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance, and we believe they are helpful to investors, analysts and other interested parties as measures of our operating performance from period to period. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis with the exception of revenue growth rates, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Shacey. Shacey Petrovic : Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our third quarter results reflect outstanding execution by our Insulet team and momentum across our global business. We delivered 17% revenue growth, driven by total Omnipod growth of 22%. While we are experiencing headwinds related to the ongoing impact of the global pandemic, revenue growth was near the high end of our expectations. We achieved these strong results, thanks to our annuity model, which is a competitive differentiator that provides insulation from market disruption. We continue to achieve strong new customer additions, and we celebrated another record-setting quarter in the United States. We are seeing more impact from COVID internationally and expect this to continue over the short term. We are also seeing increasing preference for automated insulin delivery systems among people with type 1 diabetes, setting us up for an exciting launch of our first AID system, Omnipod 5. Until then, we expect these factors to affect our top line results in Q4 and for a portion of 2022. Nevertheless, we continue to expect double-digit revenue growth in Q4 of this year, including high-teens to low-20% for total Omnipod, with positive momentum entering 2022. Wayde will elaborate on this in his remarks. Our team has done a remarkable job navigating this dynamic time in the market, and 2021 will mark not only another year of strong revenue growth, but also tremendous advancement of our strategic priorities. Diabetes is becoming more prevalent, and pump penetration in both, the type 1 and type 2 markets is low. In fact, we believe the U.S. type 1 market can double over the coming years from its current penetration rate of approximately one-third. Additionally, the type 2 market with a U.S. penetration rate in the low single digits offers significant room for growth. We already see people with diabetes adopting technology at accelerated rates, driven by Pod therapy and automated insulin delivery. Internationally, both the type 1 and type 2 insulin-intensive markets are even less penetrated with sizable runways for expansion. We continue to disrupt the old market paradigm with a leading technology and differentiated business model that deliver an improved customer experience and improved outcomes. Our success in the type 1 and type 2 markets demonstrates the power of Omnipod and the value it delivers compared to MDI and legacy pump therapies. While not having a commercialized AID system presents some competitive headwinds in the near term, our performance without Omnipod 5 highlights the incredible growth opportunities that we will begin to unlock in 2022 and beyond. We expect AID adoption and our highly differentiated platform to provide years of exciting growth as we advance our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes. Our journey will take a major step forward with the expected upcoming FDA clearance of Omnipod 5, which remains on track to occur later this quarter. As we recently shared, we submitted our responses to the FDA\u2019s request for additional information in September. We are pleased to have that part of the process complete and can\u2019t wait to bring Omnipod 5 to market, as we are confident it will be a transformative product for people living with diabetes. We are in the final stages of the review and our team is working closely with the FDA, who has been a great partner in the process. Advancing toward Omnipod 5 clearance is not the only strategic progress we made this quarter. We continue to drive growing Omnipod DASH coverage and volume through the U.S. pharmacy channel and further penetrate the type 2 market, where we are uniquely positioned with our product innovation and differentiated business model. Omnipod DASH has proven to be a terrific solution for people living with type 2 insulin requiring diabetes, where today, we have established a leadership position. Additionally, we continue to amass compelling clinical evidence that supports Omnipod\u2019s many benefits. This includes impressive new Omnipod 5 data we shared in September at EASD. Taken together, we are on track to deliver another year of strong financial and operational performance and outstanding strategic progress. I will now speak to each of our strategic imperatives, including expanding access and awareness, delivering consumer-focused innovation, growing our global addressable market and driving operational excellence. Access and awareness both remain critically low throughout the global diabetes market, despite millions of newly diagnosed people each year. Awareness of advanced technologies like Omnipod needs to increase, especially awareness of its many benefits, such as its simplicity, discretion, improved quality of life and better outcomes. In addition, access to technology is still far too complicated. We have broken down barriers through our innovative pay-as-you-go business model in the U.S. pharmacy and raised awareness through our direct-to-consumer campaigns. We are pleased with the impact both efforts have had on improving access for many who require care. Even with our successes to date, however, many opportunities remain to improve access and awareness in order to empower more people with diabetes to live healthier, easier lives. In the United States, our pay-as-you-go business model in the pharmacy channel provides benefits for everyone. It\u2019s more efficient for Insulet and provides an improved experience and lower out-of-pocket costs for consumers, with the vast majority paying less than $50 per month through the pharmacy. Additionally, it\u2019s easier for physicians to prescribe and offers numerous benefits to payers. In the third quarter, we expanded Omnipod DASH U.S. covered lives to over 80%, which in turn drove increased volume through the pharmacy channel. Payers are increasingly recognizing the economic benefits of offering Omnipod DASH in the pharmacy. In the U.S., our new customer starts once again reflected the value Omnipod offers compared to MDI as well as our growing strength in the type 2 market. MDI conversions represented over 80% of our U.S. new customer starts, and the percentage that were type 2 remains in the 35% to 40% range, even with the strong new customer growth within the type 1 population. Our MDI conversion rate continues to trend upward as we successfully drive adoption among people living with type 2 diabetes, the majority of whom come from MDI. In addition to expanding affordability, we are also driving access to Omnipod in a number of other ways in order to provide more options for people living with diabetes. We recently received FDA clearance for use of Lilly\u2019s Lyumjev with Omnipod. We are the only insulin pump manufacturer in the United States to obtain this indication, which we pursued to provide more alternatives and flexibility for customers. A key component of our awareness strategy remains our DTC advertising. Our efforts in the U.S. and select international markets continue to generate a highly positive response. The feedback has been enthusiastic and the increased awareness, interest and leads are contributing to our new customer growth. Our efforts are attracting MDI users and competitive pumpers as both base unmet needs that Omnipod helps address. Additionally, our DTC efforts are driving increased interest from individuals with type 2 diabetes as more primary care physicians learn about the benefits of Omnipod for this underserved population. So, DTC will remain a core component of our awareness efforts, and we are encouraged by the early results. We are a consumer-centric company and our innovation efforts are focused on delivering the best experience to our consumers. To that end, we are confident Omnipod 5 will mark an enormous step forward and drive accelerated adoption. Today, we offer a tubeless on-body experience that is unique compared to anything else in the market and an access model in the U.S. that has eliminated needless barriers and burdensome costs. The experience that Omnipod DASH provides is unparalleled, and Omnipod 5 will mark another breakthrough in diabetes care that builds upon our existing competitive advantages. Omnipod 5 will deliver groundbreaking technology first, including full compatible smartphone control with an algorithm residing on the Pod and SIM cards in each handheld controller. Omnipod 5 is a transformative innovation and will remain highly accessible and affordable through the pharmacy channel. It will be priced at parity with Omnipod DASH, despite the increased value and advanced technology the system offers. In turn, we believe this will drive faster coverage of Omnipod 5, and we are already off to a great start. While we eagerly await Omnipod 5 clearance, our efforts to prepare for a successful launch have been moving at full speed, including securing coverage. Payers are generally reluctant to negotiate coverage terms prior to product clearance. However, given the excitement around Omnipod 5, we already have secured substantial coverage. We expect this head start on access to position us for a highly successful launch of Omnipod 5. We cannot wait to receive clearance as we know the incredible impact our advanced technology will have on people living with diabetes. The power of Omnipod is clearly demonstrated by the compelling clinical data we have shared over the course of 2021. One recent highlight was our new pivotal study extension results for Omnipod 5 presented at EASD. This study marked a total of one year of Omnipod 5 use in ages 6 through 70 years old. We were thrilled to find that the outstanding safety and improved glycemic outcomes first observed in the 3-month Omnipod 5 pivotal study were maintained over 12 months of home use. The data demonstrated the trifecta of insulin management, a sustained reduction in A1c; improved time and range; and minimal hypoglycemia. This long-term data demonstrates the durable benefits that Omnipod 5 offers. We are also close to submitting to the FDA our preschool expanded indication down to age two and expect to do so shortly following Omnipod 5 clearance. We continue to plan for an expanded indication in 2022. Additionally, we advanced our type 2 clinical efforts and remain in the six-month extension phase of our Omnipod 5 type 2 feasibility study. The early data is very promising, and we expect to share the results at a future conference. Following clearance for Omnipod 5, we will begin discussions with the FDA on pivotal trial requirements for an expanded indication in this patient population. We are excited to be pioneers in bringing the benefits of automated insulin delivery to people living with type 2 insulin-dependent diabetes. In addition to Omnipod 5, we also presented results from our largest cohort study of people living with type 1 diabetes who use Omnipod DASH. Across approximately 4,800 people, the results demonstrated low time in hypoglycemia and a significant decrease in A1c after 90 days of use for children, adolescents and adults. For adults, the decrease in A1c was achieved while also demonstrating a 20% reduction in total daily dose of insulin used. As we build a portfolio of clinical evidence for our near-term innovations, we are also investing in the technologies required to position Omnipod for long-term growth. Our teams are diligently working on an iOS version of the Omnipod 5 mobile app, globalizing our AID system to bring it to international markets, and integrating Omnipod 5 with both Abbott\u2019s FreeStyle Libre and Dexcom\u2019s G7. We\u2019re excited to continue collaborating with these two great partners and in time, offer CGM choice to our customers. We are also leveraging our significant digital capabilities to expand the ecosystem around Omnipod. Our Omnipod VIEW app was built for caregivers. Today, it allows caregivers of Omnipod DASH users to see real-time insulin data remotely. Omnipod 5 enhances the power of Omnipod VIEW because of the incorporation of SIM cards in every controller. SIM cards mean every user will have the unique experience of constant connectivity and being able to share real-time insulin and CGM data with caregivers and loved ones. SIM cards also mean no Omnipod 5 customer will need to manually upload data when visiting with his or her care team, thanks to cloud-to-cloud data transfer. Looking to the future, our algorithm and data science teams have already processed the data from our pivotal studies and type 2 feasibility study and are hard at work on our next-generation AID system. We believe we\u2019ve built a blockbuster with Omnipod 5, and we are excited to continue to innovate on the extraordinary technology platforms it provides us. Now, turning to global expansion, where we are growing our global addressable market across attractive international regions. Our international expansion unlocks the power of Omnipod for people across the world and will further increase our global addressable market beyond the 11 million to 12 million people we estimate are living with insulin-dependent diabetes throughout the global markets we currently serve. During the last 12 months, we expanded our global presence in seven new countries within Europe, the Middle East and Asia Pacific. While it takes time for new markets to meaningfully contribute to our results given the nature of our business model, we see strong long-term growth potential through our growing presence in multiple regions. The work to bring Omnipod 5 to our international markets is ongoing, and we are making great progress. Omnipod DASH has been a major global growth driver, and we believe adding our game-changing AID system to our product offering will further strengthen our competitive position across our international markets. Moving forward, we see a number of attractive opportunities to expand our global presence, to further penetrate our existing markets and to introduce advanced technology to underserved regions. We continue to assess many markets throughout the globe where we know people with diabetes can greatly benefit from Omnipod and where we are confident we can drive strong adoption and growth. Our near-term focus is on growing our global presence throughout the Middle East and Europe, and over the medium term, we plan to expand further within the Asia Pac region. Lastly, we continue to invest in our global manufacturing operations, which will further strengthen our production capabilities, efficiency and scale. Today, we are producing tens of millions of Pods a year and doing so at the highest quality. Our manufacturing expertise is a competitive advantage. And the investments we have made over the last several years to expand our operational excellence and establish redundant manufacturing capabilities while securing strong partnerships with key suppliers are critical. This positions us to support growing global demand for Omnipod DASH, the upcoming launch of Omnipod 5, our international expansion and our innovation pipeline. It has also helped to mitigate global supply chain issues throughout the pandemic and represents an important long-term driver of sustainable revenue growth and gross margin expansion. In closing, we remain on track to deliver another year of double-digit revenue growth and have made significant progress across each of our strategic imperatives. The clearance and limited market release of Omnipod 5 are just around the corner, and we could not be more excited for just how transformative this innovation will be for people living with diabetes. Our passionate and hard-working global team is our greatest strength. And we are focused on finishing the year strong and carrying the underlying momentum in our business into 2022 and well beyond. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Wayde. Wayde McMillan : Thank you, Shacey. The third quarter marked a continuation of our strong financial performance and strategic progress. We generated strong new customer starts despite continuing to feel the pandemic\u2019s impact, which speaks to the durable power of Omnipod and our success driving expanded awareness and eliminating access barriers. We remain incredibly excited about the upcoming launch of Omnipod 5 and what it can do for people living with diabetes. We generated 17% revenue growth in the third quarter, finishing near the high end of our guidance range, driven by total Omnipod growth of 22%. In Q3, we delivered U.S. Omnipod revenue growth of 26%, within the range of our expectations. As a reminder, our Q3 growth rate benefited from the net impact of the estimated $4 million distributor channel destocking last year. The trend of record U.S. new customer starts continued in the third quarter, falling within our expected range. We continue to execute and drive strong top line growth and expect to finish the year with continued momentum. Also in Q3, we once again increased our volume through the U.S. pharmacy channel and drove strong Omnipod DASH adoption globally among both, type 1 and type 2 customers. During Q3, Omnipod DASH drove 80% of our U.S. new customer starts, and we increased pharmacy channel volume to almost 50% of our total U.S. volume. In Q3, international Omnipod revenue grew 14%, at the high end of our guidance range. As a reminder, Q3 growth was impacted by the estimated $4 million to $5 million of distributor channel stocking that we experienced in the third quarter of last year, ahead of the international full market release of Omnipod DASH. Today, all our new customers start on Omnipod DASH, which continues to drive adoption across our markets and our expanding customer base. That said, we continue to experience pandemic-related headwinds with a lagging revenue effect due to the compounding impact of our annuity model. During Q3, we saw the biggest impact from COVID in several of our international markets due to increased restrictions implemented in the first half of the year. As a result of the virtual training and onboarding capabilities we built at the start of 2020 as well as the team\u2019s adaptability and execution, we have successfully mitigated much of these short-term headwinds. Nevertheless, we will continue to feel the effects on our top line over the next few quarters. Additionally, we expect Omnipod DASH will drive continued solid adoption. We are seeing increased competition in some markets from AID systems. As Shacey mentioned, we are excited to advance our Omnipod 5 innovation efforts as we look to bring what we believe to be a transformative and unmatched AID system to all of our markets. The fundamentals of our international business remain strong, and we continue to grow our existing markets and expand our global footprint. We also continue to augment our team and capabilities to drive sustainable growth over the long term. I\u2019ll touch on our near-term expectations in a moment. Lastly, our estimated global attrition in the high single digits, and Pod utilization remained stable during Q3. While we saw a slight impact on attrition in a few international markets where AID systems have been launched, the changes are not material overall. Drug Delivery revenue declined 30% during the third quarter, finishing around the high end of our expectations. As a reminder, order volumes were elevated in the prior year as a result of the pandemic. Gross margin was 68.5% in the third quarter, representing a 360 basis-point increase or a 330 basis-point increase on a constant currency basis. This performance was in line with our expectations. The primary drivers of our gross margin performance were our improved manufacturing operations and the mix benefit of growing volume through the U.S. pharmacy channel. These drivers were partially offset by the expected higher mix of costs as we continue to ramp U.S. manufacturing. Operating expenses were in line with our expectations as we continue to invest in our robust innovation pipeline, our clinical initiatives, our commercial efforts to support the expected upcoming launch of Omnipod 5 and also our continued international expansion. Operating margin was 12.2%, up 200 basis points, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.2%, up 210 basis points. Operating income was in line with our expectations as we invest throughout our global business to fuel our long-term growth trajectory. Turning to cash and liquidity. We finished Q3 with $857 million in cash and short-term investments and the full $60 million available under our revolving credit facility. We\u2019re in a strong financial position with no near-term obligations, and we have opportunities to further invest across key areas of our business. We continue to take measured steps to strengthen our overall capital structure. As we noted on our second quarter call, we used the proceeds from our Term Loan B financing to repurchase 92% of our convertible notes due 2024. In July, an additional 5% of the outstanding balance was converted, which resulted in a $1.5 million loss on extinguishment during Q3 that is excluded from adjusted EBITDA. Also in July, we raised an additional $43 million of cash through an equipment financing, which further helps to reduce our overall cost of capital. Now, turning to our outlook for the remainder of this year. We are updating our full year revenue guidance and now expect 18% to 20% growth, including Omnipod revenue growth of 18% to 20%. We now expect full year U.S. Omnipod revenue growth in the range of 22% to 24%, driven by increased access and awareness, our strong U.S. new customer starts throughout this year, the benefits of our annuity-based model and our growing volume in the type 1 and 2 markets and through the pharmacy channel. For international Omnipod, we now expect full year 2021 revenue growth in the range of 12% to 14%. The ongoing adoption of Omnipod DASH and expansion of our customer base continued to fuel our international growth. We expect the tailwinds in both our U.S. and international product lines will be partially offset by the lagging impact of the pandemic, which has a cumulative impact on our results as well as some competitive pressure from AID systems in the market. Lastly, we now expect revenue growth of 11% to 16% for Drug Delivery based on our partners\u2019 increased forecast. Turning to gross margin. Looking at Q4 specifically, we continue to expect a sequential decline, largely due to higher production costs as we ramp our automated manufacturing lines. While this causes some anticipated fluctuation in our quarter-to-quarter performance, we remain on track for full year gross margin in the range of 68% to 69%, likely closer to the low end of the range. Our gross margin performance represents a notable year-over-year increase and reflects both, our enhanced manufacturing capabilities as well as the benefits of our growing volume through the U.S. pharmacy channel. We continue to expect operating expenses for the full year to rise in line with revenue as we have been investing in our innovation pipeline, sales and marketing capabilities, global manufacturing and international expansion. We believe these investments are critical to sustaining the momentum in our business and building upon our foundation for long-term sustainable growth. We are reaffirming full year operating margin in the low double digits range. The key drivers of our growth include our strong top line revenue growth and gross margin expansion. We continue to expect an approximate 100 basis-point improvement in our operating margin on an annual basis going forward. Finally, we expect capital expenditures in 2021 will slightly decrease from 2020 compared to our previous expectations of an increase, primarily due to timing. We continue to invest throughout our global manufacturing operations as well as our strategic initiatives. Turning to our fourth quarter 2021 guidance. We expect total company revenue growth of 19% to 25%. This includes total Omnipod revenue growth of 17% to 22%. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect Q4 revenue growth of 22% to 27%. The core drivers of this growth are the cumulative impact from our record new customer starts during 2021, the benefits of our annuity model and increased Omnipod DASH volume through the U.S. pharmacy channel. We expect Q4 international Omnipod revenue growth of 7% to 13%, driven by continued Omnipod DASH adoption across our international markets. We expect the tailwinds in both product lines will be partially offset by the same headwinds mentioned for the full year guide. Lastly, we expect Q4 Drug Delivery revenue to increase 45% to 65%, based on our partner\u2019s current forecast. In conclusion, we are on track for another successful year as we continue to deliver solid financial performance and broad strategic progress. We\u2019re focusing on finishing the year strong and are excited for the expected upcoming clearance of Omnipod 5. We\u2019re investing in the critical areas of our business that will build on our current competitive advantages and drive further differentiation in the near and long term. There are significant growth opportunities ahead, and we remain well positioned to continue to drive meaningful value to all of our stakeholders. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dalam to open up for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] I show our first question comes from the line of Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Please go ahead. Margaret Kaczor : Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to start with type 2. You guys mentioned a few updates on the call, specifically kind of on the algorithm side and trying to make progress on O5. So, I was curious what kind of pivotal study that -- what that pivotal study could look like. And then, as you think about the types of patients that could benefit from Omnipod and O5 specifically, would it be intensely managed, or could you actually kind of accelerate some of the efforts into other types of type 2s and why? Shacey Petrovic : Thanks, Margaret, for the question. Yes. So, maybe I\u2019ll take us back a few months. If you remember, we shared really compelling data at ENDO back in March that demonstrated the impact of Omnipod 5 that it can have on people living with type 2 insulin-dependent diabetes. And that data demonstrated -- early data, but it demonstrated more than a doubling of time and range from 27% to 59%. So, we do believe that the technology has tremendous potential to make a positive impact on outcomes for people living with insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes. We are looking at the intensively managed group for this technology. And as -- one trend we see -- macro trend in the market that we see is that there is growing utilization of CGM among type 2 users, particularly intensively managed type 2 users. So, our belief is that as more CGM use happens, that will drive more seeking of these patients for tools to manage their disease, and that Omnipod 5 will be right there with the best wearable AID system for this population. In terms of what the pivotal study could look like, I think that\u2019s a great question. This is unchartered territory for people living with type 2 diabetes. And so, we are really proud to be doing the work to bring this technology to this population and to be pioneers. The feasibility data looks promising, and we still need to really have the discussion with the FDA on what a pivotal could look like. I think, we could see a lot of range here. It might be that we can use some real-world data because it\u2019s clear that there will be type 2 users of Omnipod 5 upon launch because of the access position that we\u2019re in or it could look like a full-blown pivotal like we did in the type 1 population. So, that will remain to be seen once we\u2019ve had the conversation with the FDA. And we\u2019ll certainly keep everybody posted because we do view this as a really exciting opportunity for that segment. Operator : I show our next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Robbie Marcus : Wayde, I wanted to ask on U.S. and international Omnipod for fourth quarter. And I was hoping you could just sort of walk us through some of the puts and takes here. It looks like in the international market that the midpoint of the guide is down sequentially on a dollar basis. So, just wondering what would drive that. Are people using less Pods? I would imagine with the annuity model, if utilization was the same, it\u2019d probably increase. And then, also, in the U.S., you\u2019re still seeing record new patient starts. So, I was just sort of wondering what brought you down off the top end of the guidance range there, and walk us through some of the dynamics there. Thanks. Wayde McMillan : Sure, Robbie. Yes, happy to. So overall, we\u2019re still holding the high end of our total company beginning of your guide at 20%. So, no change there. And we\u2019ve raised the low end up to 18%. So, we\u2019re 18% to 20% now for both, total company and total Omnipod. But, as you mentioned, we\u2019ve tightened the guidance ranges for each product line for the year, although still really strong growth, especially in the United States. So, what are we factoring in? We\u2019re factoring in the lagging impact of the pandemic as well as some competition from AID systems in the market, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks. So, overall, our Q4 guide is very strong. At the high end, it is our highest growth rate for the year for both, Omnipod and total company, with 17% to 22% for total Omnipod and then 19% to 25% for total company. As is our annual guide, it\u2019s still 18% to 20%, we keep an eye on the annual guide as we think about Q4 as well. So, despite some COVID-19 headwinds and the pandemic\u2019s impact on new customer starts last year that factored into the growth rate this year as well as the delayed clearance here for the launch of Omnipod 5, we\u2019re still at that high end for the full year. And if we hit the high end, we\u2019ll have now grown 20% for the last two years through COVID and with increasing AID competition here. So, a couple of specifics. Robbie, international down sequential at the midpoint. We don\u2019t really think about the midpoint. We factor in our total puts and takes, and it\u2019s sequential growth at the high end, sequential decline at the low end. One of the things we have to watch for internationally is some order patterns. We sell a lot of our products through distributors internationally, and sometimes there\u2019s order pattern, so we have to account for that in addition to the other factors I just mentioned. And in the U.S., again, we have the strongest guide for the year at 27% for Q4. And so, although we\u2019ve tightened the ranges somewhat, we\u2019re still looking at a very strong quarter for Q4. Operator : I show next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy from SVB Leerink. Please go ahead. Danielle Antalffy : Apologies if I missed this, but my first question, Shacey, is for you on your confidence in Omnipod 5 approval by the end of the year. Just trying to push a little bit, make sure this isn\u2019t going to slip again. So, just curious, what gives you the confidence? Are we just waiting now for FDA, or have you had more back -- is there still more back and forth happening with FDA? And then, I have one quick follow-up. Shacey Petrovic : Okay. Danielle, we may need your follow-up now or you might not fit it in. So, do you want to ask it now? Danielle Antalffy : Oh, sure. Sorry. So, just as you -- as it relates to the Omnipod 5 launch as well, I\u2019m curious if you guys think about what learning -- what you could learn early on in the launch, or do you think launching an integrated system is not going to be all that different from sort of how you\u2019ve launched the Omnipod in the past? Just curious if there\u2019s anything different about launching an integrated system versus launching just a standard Omnipod. And should we be thinking about this launch differently than sort of how you\u2019ve been present in the market in the past? And that\u2019s it for me. Shacey Petrovic : Great. Okay. Thank you for your questions, Danielle. Yes. So, I\u2019ll take the one on Omnipod -- confidence in Omnipod 5, and then I\u2019ll let Bret just what we expect to learn with an integrated system launch. So, the interactions have been frequent and very collaborative with the FDA. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, obviously, we had submitted the update to the app back in September. And since then, we\u2019ve had multiple back and forth with the FDA. And frankly, it\u2019s that back and forth that gives us the confidence that the system will be cleared before the end of the year. We are down to the final mile, and we\u2019re really appreciative of the FDA\u2019s responsiveness and engagement. It is a breakthrough device-designated technology, and it is a breakthrough device because of so much breakthrough technology in the system with full phone control, with the algorithm on the Pod. No one has ever done this before, including the FDA. And so, we are plowing new ground here, which we\u2019re excited about. But, we feel very confident in the quality of the submission and very positive about the interactions that we\u2019ve had with the FDA. And then, I would just say before I pass it off to Bret, the teams are doing a terrific job. Bret is leading a lot of this effort, just an outstanding job preparing for our limited market release. And that includes all of the testing of the training systems, the support, the benefits investigations, obviously, establishing coverage, which I spoke to, manufacturing the product, all of that stuff. So, we are ready to go and couldn\u2019t be more excited. And I\u2019ll let Bret answer your second question. Bret Christensen : Yes. Hi Danielle, it\u2019s Bret. So, there\u2019s a lot that we can build upon from the learnings of DASH. And Shacey highlighted some of what we anticipate in the LMR. The reason we\u2019re doing the limited release is so we could test some of these things and establish access early. We\u2019re well ahead of the game on access and as well as the user experience, which is some of what I think you\u2019re getting out with the integrated systems. There\u2019s a lot to understand there. So, with the introduction of Omnipod 5, the onboarding experience will be unique and different from anything we\u2019ve ever done, which is part of what we\u2019ll be testing in the LMR. Some of that depends on their experience with both Dexcom and with Omnipod. And depending on their experience, each onboarding experience is unique to the individual. And in some cases, they\u2019ll be able to completely self-serve and onboard. And so, that\u2019s going to be really exciting. It\u2019s going to establish tremendous commercial scale for us, enable us to onboard many of our existing Podders that are so excited about Omnipod 5. And all of that -- the cooperation between Dexcom and Insulet on customer support will also be unique as we\u2019ve sort of worked through all, the different use cases and scenarios, where there\u2019ll be warm transfers going back and forth to different -- the companies depending on what the potential issue could be. But all of that stuff is -- when we talk about the customer experience is what we\u2019ll be testing in the limited release before we move to a full market release, but we\u2019re well prepared for all of those things. Operator : I show our next question comes from the line of Lawrence Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Lawrence Biegelsen : Just, Shacey, one big-picture question on international. We\u2019ve seen it slow the last couple of years and the midpoint of the guidance is 13% this year. How should we think about international growth before Omnipod 5 launches outside the U.S.? And any color on whether that could start happening in 2022, or should we be thinking about international Omnipod 5 launch as more like 2023? Shacey Petrovic : I think, our international business has been performing well, as Wayde said, in the face of some challenges related to COVID and some market dynamics around AID adoption. DASH has really been helping us to drive that growth. And I think, ultimately, we are seeing double-digit growth, despite the fact that the environment is changing in terms of CGM access, in terms of AID access and awareness. And so, that\u2019s great. We expect that to continue. We expect new patient adds to continue in our international markets. And it\u2019s one of the reasons why we\u2019re working so hard to bring Omnipod 5 to our international markets. We\u2019re not going to give a time line on that yet. We really wanted to wait to get Omnipod 5 into the market before we give guidance, so you can expect that sometime next year. But, I can tell you that the work is underway, fully committed to bringing our system to our global markets, and we will do that as quickly as we can. I think ultimately, these trends, while they present some near-term headwinds, they are very favorable trends for us, both in the U.S. and internationally. As we think about increasing awareness and adoption of AID in the U.S., as we think about increasing access for Dexcom\u2019s CGM and increasing access and adoption of AID in our international markets, that paves the way for a successful launch of Omnipod 5. So, while it presents some near-term challenges, really medium term, it should be a great trend for us. Operator : I show our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Baird. Please go ahead. Jeff Johnson : Wayde, you\u2019ve mentioned the competitive impact of AID systems a couple of times. Every time you do, it seems like it\u2019s focused on the international market. So one, we\u2019ve got at least one of those AID systems here in the U.S., you\u2019re not mentioning it as much from a U.S. perspective. Is that just given the pharmacy access, the t2 access, things like that that\u2019s covering that up, or is there something specific in the international markets relative to the U.S. that is causing some of that issue, number one? And number two, Shacey, just to push on that OUS O5 time line and commentary you had. Regulatory-wise, what would you have to do? Can you use U.S. pivotal data to get a CE Mark and launch in Europe, maybe in Canada, things like that, or would you have to go through trials there that you haven\u2019t yet contemplated or started? Thanks. Wayde McMillan : Yes. Hey Jeff, I can certainly start that. And I appreciate the question on this evolving dynamic that Shacey just highlighted, eventually becomes a positive for us. We do think the dynamic is different between the U.S. and international. In the U.S., certainly, we\u2019ve got AID systems to contend with. But, as you mentioned, we have done a great job with other significant growth drivers, DTC, our business model in the pharmacy channel with pay-as-you-go. Certainly, DASH has performed well in the U.S. So, we have a lot of momentum behind it. In international, we\u2019ve just launched DASH over the last year and have good momentum there, growing in the mid-teens internationally. But as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have seen a couple of countries start to see some more stronger AID competition. And as Shacey mentioned, as CGM adoption ramps, certainly, that brings AID systems with it. So, we do think the headwind is stronger internationally. Shacey Petrovic : And Jeff, to your question regarding Omnipod 5 internationally, there is not a clinical trial requirement to get CE Mark to be able to sell and market Omnipod 5 in our international markets. It is a regulatory pathway, the MDR pathway that we will submit through for CE Mark. And there will be clinical work that is done to establish increased adoption and increased access and coverage of the technology, but we don\u2019t actually require any type of clinical to get clearance to be able to sell and market the technology in our international markets. So, the work that is underway is the technical work around translations, unit of measure, that stuff for the system, internationalizing the label and the system. And then, of course, we\u2019ve got some regulatory work and then some clinical commercial work really for more of the commercial elements of the launch. Operator : Thank you. I show next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor from UBS. Please go ahead. Matt Taylor : So, I just want to ask one about international, just as a educational question. I mean, you talk a lot about pharmacy and pay-as-you-go in the U.S. And I just wanted to characterize how much of those types of channel and trialing advantages were translatable in the international markets, given they\u2019re heterogeneous and you have a different go-to-market strategy there. Could you talk a little bit about that? Shacey Petrovic : Yes. Matt, it\u2019s such a great question. And so, I\u2019ll kick us off, and then I\u2019ll ask Bret to weigh in as well. So, I think it is -- most of the dynamics that are driving our success in the U.S., you highlighted them, pay-as-you-go and type 2, for example, those are opportunities outside of the U.S. It\u2019s just a matter of time. And as you know, the OUS markets are fragmented and complex. And so, it will be more fragmented in terms of how we deliver on those opportunities outside the U.S. And for type 2, there really is less coverage. One of the reasons why we\u2019ve had so much success in the United States in the pharmacy with type 2 is because of the differentiated access position. It is much easier to access Omnipod through the pharmacy than it is to access pump therapy through the DME channel. And so, that is what is fueling part of our growth and why we\u2019ve got 35% to 40% of our new starts type 2. The same value proposition exists in terms of the clinical impact, the improvement in A1c and the reduction in total daily dose of insulin. But we\u2019ve got more work to do clinically to demonstrate that healthcare economic argument outside of the U.S. and to establish reimbursement and coverage access really for type 2 outside of the U.S. And then, Bret, I know we\u2019ve had some progress on pay-as-you-Pod. If you want to talk a bit about that? Bret Christensen : Yes. Sure. Matt, it\u2019s a great question, because the growth drivers today are a little bit different in the U.S. than they are internationally, but we see those as opportunities. And Shacey highlighted that we can move to pay-as-you-go, the pharmacy channel type 2. Those are related because remember, the reason why we have such great type 2 access in the U.S. is because we don\u2019t build that upfront fee. And so, pay-as-you-go really is more key than the pharmacy channel is. And we\u2019ll be looking at all of these opportunities internationally. But, certainly, we see lots of opportunity to move to a pay-as-you-go reimbursement model in the markets that we\u2019re in and in future markets. That could open up the door for type 2 access. We think that\u2019s a good start because when you don\u2019t charge that upfront fee, you eliminate that risk for the payers. So, all these things that are carrying us today in the U.S. that really make the growth rates different than they are internationally as headwinds are fairly similar. Those are all opportunities for us in the international markets. Operator : Thank you. I show next question comes from the line of Travis Steed from Barclays. Please go ahead. Travis Steed : Just curious, Wayde, if you could give a little more color on kind of what you\u2019re seeing with COVID vacations. And are you seeing staffing issues at ENDO offices? And a little color on kind of how you see some of the puts and takes on 2022? Obviously, Omnipod 5 is a big unknown at this point when that actually comes. But, just curious if you could give some puts and takes on next year, especially given some of the unusual seasonality we saw this year with COVID. Wayde McMillan : Sure. And we\u2019re lucky enough to have Bret on. Bret, do you want to touch on what we\u2019re seeing internationally and around vacations and staffing and things? And then, I can pick up on some thoughts on 2022. Bret Christensen : Yes, sure. I can touch on both of those. So, I guess, the vacations and staffing are both -- I think the staffing is actually more of a real issue within some of the endocrinology offices. And that becomes an issue for companies like ours, only if we rely on those staff to do some of the work for onboarding. And that\u2019s an effort that we\u2019ve had underway for a long time now to take that work away from healthcare providers, to do more of the trainings, to do more of the onboarding. And we believe that we are the easiest product to train and onboard on because of the ease of use of Omnipod. And so, we don\u2019t see that as a real headwind, although those are real issues for our customers and endocrinology offices, it\u2019s not slowing us down in any way. Wayde McMillan : Great. And just picking up on 2022. So, regarding how we\u2019re thinking about our outlook there at this point, we don\u2019t issue formal 2022 guidance until Q4 call in February, per usual. However, happy to give you some of our thinking here. And we do think that we\u2019re in a good position to start strong again in the 15% to 20% range for total diabetes. It\u2019s a good place to start. We do have some differences between the regions given the different dynamics, some of them we\u2019ve talked about here. I think, we see U.S. Omnipod with really strong momentum. And we\u2019re thinking, again, it\u2019s probably high-teens, low-20s kind of a start to the year; international, more in the low double digits, at the lower end of that 15% to 20% or even below. So, it\u2019s looking like 15% to 20% for total Omnipod, which is strong growth off a growing base. And we have opportunities to exceed that, but certainly some risks to consider. For Drug Delivery, you can expect it to decline year-over-year, coming off a very strong year elevated by the pandemic here. So, overall, we\u2019re thinking about our total company revenue growth in the mid-teens. This can change as we close out Q4 and plan our official guidance here. But, that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it today. Maybe some color on the U.S. Regarding U.S., we need to keep in mind that Omnipod 5 will be in a limited market release for some time and ramping during the year with access growing. And it takes time for our annuity model to build momentum and accelerate revenue. So, we\u2019ll get some benefit from Omnipod 5 in 2022, but there are many factors to determine how much. And we\u2019ll certainly provide updates as we go through the year. But, we won\u2019t see a full year impact from Omnipod 5 until 2023 and beyond. But, that really sets us up for multiple years of strong growth from there. Shacey Petrovic : I think, Travis -- Wayde, that was very well articulated. Travis, I would just point out to what Wayde is saying that Omnipod 5 will be an accelerator. It\u2019s just a matter of when we can get into full market release in the U.S. and then when we can get it into market in our international markets. And obviously, the work is underway and the teams are very focused on making that happen. And then, as we look beyond 2022, we couldn\u2019t be more excited because we\u2019re launching what we think is going to be the most differentiated technology in the AID space. We see follow-on indications pretty rapidly with pediatrics. We see international expansion. We see iOS. And we see additional CGM integrations over the coming couple of years. And so, really exciting trajectory of innovation and growth over the next few years. Operator : I show our next question comes from the line of Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Jayson Bedford : Geez, Wayde, after that last answer, I\u2019m kind of tempted to ask about 2023 guidance, but I won\u2019t. So, I have a couple of pharmacy questions. Pharmacy access, it\u2019s now near 50% of your U.S. volume. Can we assume that the majority of these folks will have access to Omnipod 5 upon launch? And then, my second question is for the other half of folks that are not accessing Omnipod through the pharmacy, it looks like two-thirds may have coverage but are not yet going through the pharmacy. I\u2019m just wondering, why are those folks not choosing to go through what seems like a better access point? Bret Christensen : Yes. Hi Jayson, it\u2019s Bret. I can take those questions. So, I think what you\u2019re referencing is 50% of our volume is now in the pharmacy channel. Our access is actually quite higher than that as DASH access is 80% now, which is -- the bulk of that is all in the pharmacy channel. So, very strong access in the pharmacy channel. And your question as to what we can expect at launch, we\u2019re well ahead of DASH at this time and didn\u2019t think we\u2019d have any access with Omnipod 5 until we got clearance from the FDA. So, we\u2019re quite pleased with where we\u2019re at. The conversations with payers are going very nicely as we\u2019ve talked about AID systems, the pivotal data. And I think they\u2019re just waiting for clearance to start that process to contract and then add us to formulary. There\u2019s really no reason at all why we wouldn\u2019t expect Omnipod 5 access to very quickly reach the access that we have today with DASH in the pharmacy channel. So, it\u2019s just a process and a little bit of time. And then, your question about why wouldn\u2019t somebody start in the pharmacy channel, knowing that it\u2019s a better product and a better experience. While the vast majority of co-pays are less than $50 in the pharmacy channel, it doesn\u2019t mean all of them are. And in some cases, our legacy access is different than DASH. And so, there are situations, most probably access related why somebody may not choose to go into the pharmacy channel right upfront. And so, that access, we\u2019re continuing to get stronger and build every day, and that\u2019s why the percentage of new starts that are DASH into the pharmacy channel continues to rise. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Cecilia Furlong from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Cecilia Furlong : I wanted to ask about just the percentage of patients coming from MDI. It sounded like it ticked up slightly this quarter. But, just as you think about O5 launch going forward, how do you think about the ability of O5 to really expand pump utilization versus drive competitive conversions going forward relative to DASH? Shacey Petrovic : Thanks, Cecilia. It\u2019s a great question. What we know is those percentages will change. It\u2019s a little hard to predict. But, when I think about Omnipod 5, I think about it as a additive growth driver. So, all the exciting growth that we\u2019re driving because of the pharmacy and because of type 2 adoption, which is primarily multiple daily injections today in the type 2 users, that will continue. We know we\u2019ve got a leadership position there and we have a differentiated technology for the type 2 user. But Omnipod 5 will be additive in terms of the growth eventually when we get into full market release and in terms of the patients that it\u2019s bringing in, and it should make us more competitive for those users that are choosing AID over pump therapy. And we know that that\u2019s the primary reason why somebody doesn\u2019t choose Omnipod when they come on to pump therapy. So, we would guess that our pump conversions will increase with the launch of Omnipod 5. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Anthony Petrone : Thanks and congratulations on a good quarter. I have three quick ones. Just a quick update on DTC, continuing to see the TV ads, and so just wondering if there\u2019s any update on return on investment there on DTC? And what are the plans as you get into O5? And then, just on supply chain constraints, as we look into 2022, do you see any potential impacts to the working capital cycle as we get into next year? Bret Christensen : Yes. Hi Anthony, I can start that one with an update on DTC. It continues to be a really strong growth driver for us in the U.S. We know that awareness is one of the problems we need to solve for, not just in the U.S. but internationally. And so, our spend has been pretty constant for DTC. We started this, remember, in September about a year ago, and it continues to be a real growth driver for us. We\u2019re getting better at it. We\u2019re getting better at converting leads into new starts. And we\u2019re getting really creative with our messaging, too. We launched different campaigns over the summer, called the Summer of Omnipod, which highlights the form factor of Omnipod, some of the benefits that we have and the freedom that Omnipod offers. We\u2019ve also dabbled a little bit internationally. So, we\u2019ve done -- run some TV commercials in the UK, some in Germany, some in Canada. And we\u2019re trying to learn the ROI in those specific countries, too, because we just see it as a really massive opportunity to increase awareness. And the ROI has been positive. I won\u2019t throw out any numbers there, but we know it\u2019s a good investment for us and something that you can expect that we\u2019ll continue to do. Shacey Petrovic : And on the supply chain question, I can maybe start us off and then ask Wayde to comment about the impact on working capital. But, what I can tell you is that our teams are doing a marvelous job managing these dynamics. And to me, it highlights the value of the investment that we\u2019ve made over the last several years, not just in manufacturing redundancy but in supply chain redundancy. And that investment has really helped us to manage through some of the challenges that we\u2019ve seen in all environments, all industries in terms of the supply chain around freight, around certain components, et cetera. So, our team -- while we may have incurred some additional costs, they\u2019ve also done a terrific job offsetting those costs. And ultimately, there\u2019s been no impact at all to customer supply. So, that\u2019s a testament to how hard our teams are working to support the growth and also manage through these very real challenges that exist today. Wayde McMillan : Yes. I could just add to the redundancy and supply chain improvements and investments that Shacey just talked about, we have been very successfully growing our inventory ahead of revenue. So, our inventories have grown significantly over the last year. We feel very good about that given where the -- where we were in the pandemic. Our teams did a fantastic job managing through that. We actually built inventory through the pandemic. And then, with the more recent supply chain challenges globally, team has done a really nice job managing that. And so, I think what you\u2019ll continue to see us do is continue to build capacity and build inventory ahead of our operational performance. And we do that to make sure we\u2019re in the best position possible to serve our customers and for new customers coming on board. So, I don\u2019t see a major change to our working capital cycle just given that we\u2019ve increased inventories so much to this point. But, you will see us continue to invest in a growing inventory number to make sure that we\u2019ve got more than ample supply for our existing customers and for our future growth plans. Operator : I show our next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Brien from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Drew Stafford : Hi. Good afternoon. This is Drew on for Matt. Thank you for taking questions. Congrats on the solid quarter here. I appreciate the color on next year. I just want to follow up a little bit so I can understand it better. Obviously, your U.S. business is growing 20% plus the last couple of years, even despite the pandemic in here that should fade a bit next year and then definitely some room on DASH penetration and, obviously, the O5 launch at some point next year. So, is the 15% to 20% really a function of your U.S. business more towards the higher end of that range and OUS more towards the lower, or is that more a function of your expecting that ramp of O5 to not kick off in a meaningful way to the business until more later in the year? Wayde McMillan : Yes. Drew, I can start that and then Bret may want to add some color as well. So, specific to the numbers, yes, 15% to 20%, I think you have it right in the sense that the U.S. will be at the high end of that range. We\u2019re calling it high-teens, low-20s just to give ourselves some room there. But, as you said, the U.S. has lots of momentum, and you\u2019ll certainly see low-20s in that range. And then, international at the other end of the guidance, as we said, low double digits because of the dynamics we\u2019ve just talked about on the call today. Although double-digit growth internationally still good growth, strong growth on the back of DASH, we don\u2019t have an AID system there, and we haven\u2019t announced when we will yet. And so, we always put a thoughtfully appropriate guide in place for the year. We think diabetes at 15% to 20% on what\u2019s now a $1 billion base of business is a good place to start. And again, we haven\u2019t given formal guidance yet, just trying to help people understand some of the major puts and takes heading into 2022. And then, as you mentioned, Omnipod 5, that has a lot of variability to it. We\u2019ve talked about here the limited market release and how long that takes. We\u2019ve said publicly before, it\u2019s usually a three to nine-month time frame. Depending on how fast that can be will dictate how fast we move to full market release. Access is also another gating factor. We\u2019re starting really strong in a good position here, but it may take some time to build enough access. So, there\u2019s just lots of things to consider around Omnipod 5. What we said is that we\u2019ll start somewhere in this range, and we\u2019ll update as we go through the year and as we progress with Omnipod 5. And so, I don\u2019t know, Bret, if you want to add anything else there? Bret Christensen : Yes. Well said, Wayde. Drew, I would just say, your question is right. It really is a stronger U.S. growth next year that\u2019s really driven by the current growth drivers. So, DTC, our type 2 access, the pharmacy model, all those things will continue to drive the U.S. growth. We did build in some growth for Omnipod 5, as Wayde suggested. But again, with the annuity model, it takes a little bit of time. So, there\u2019s still some uncertainty of the length of the LMR, the time to get to full market release. And then, once we get to full market release, the annuity model doesn\u2019t really represent growth right away. It takes some time to build that into the rates and revenue. Operator : Thank you. I show our last question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from Citi. Please go ahead. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you so much for squeezing me in. I really appreciate it. I\u2019m trying to get my head around something, which is when Omnipod 5 comes out, what does it do in terms of the portion of the market that you\u2019re most likely to address? And so, what I\u2019m also trying to do is cross-reference that with increasing new patient starts in type 2. Do you see your market splintering? Maybe splintering is a wrong word, or expanding? Or just help me understand when it arrives and as it arrives, what happens? Shacey Petrovic : Sure. Joanne, I will start and perhaps Bret will have some additional thoughts to offer. But, we believe that Omnipod 5 will be additive to our growth. So, as you think about the momentum that exists today in our business, we\u2019ll focus on the U.S. because that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to launch first. There\u2019s a lot of momentum being driven today by DTC, so increasing awareness. There\u2019s a lot of momentum being driven today by type 2 users of DASH, the increasing use in the pharmacy, and then the benefits of the pharmacy for all users and then, of course, our differentiated form factor. And that\u2019s what\u2019s driving our growth today. All of that remains. And then, Omnipod 5 comes and is additive, and we believe will make us more compete in the type 1 space. And there is also likely to be type 2 users of the technology, although we will not market directly to them until we have an expanded label. But, we do think the technology has value there to offer. So, I think we know for all of the people that are coming out of MDI and on to pump therapy, the primary reason that someone doesn\u2019t choose Omnipod, which is clearly tests and market research to be a preferred form factor is AID. And with Omnipod 5, obviously, we check that box, and we believe we check that box with the very best system that will be on the market. And so, we think we get a lot more competitive, which is why I said earlier that the numbers will change, the ratios will change. Today, we get 80% of our users from multiple daily injections. We\u2019re going to continue to get those people, and we will get more. We will get more competitive switchers as a result of Omnipod 5. Bret Christensen : Yes. I think, those 2 percentages that we often speak to 80% of our new starts coming from MDI and 40% of our new starts being type 2, I think we\u2019re okay with those percentages going down with the introduction of Omnipod 5, as long as new starts go up, which they will for sure. The other thing to think about, Joanne, as you know, all these tailwinds that we\u2019ve spoken about, that Shacey mentioned, are still going to be there with Omnipod 5, and we remove really one of the biggest headwinds that we have today, which is AID competition. So, Omnipod 5 does check all the boxes. It\u2019s why we think it\u2019s going to be a best-in-class product offering. And we\u2019re so excited about what it does to grow once we get to full market release. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our Q&A session. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Shacey Petrovic for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Shacey Petrovic : Thank you, Dalam. And thanks, everyone, for your participation and questions today. As part of a company-wide event last week, we hosted several Omnipod users, including a few Omnipod 5 trial participants still using the system. And it was incredible to hear the impact Omnipod 5 has had on this diverse group of customers. Dwight, a grandfather living with late onset type 1 diabetes, said that because of Omnipod 5\u2019s simplicity, he truly trusted the system right away when he walked out of the clinic. Morgan, a young woman living with type 1 diabetes for 19 years, told us, \"Omnipod 5 is magic. It\u2019s unreal. I don\u2019t ever have to think about my diabetes. I want everyone to know about it. It has changed my life.\" And Valentino, a first generation American who has participated in other AID system trials said of Omnipod 5, \"All I can say is wow. I\u2019m waking up normal. I don\u2019t ever have to think about my diabetes. It brings peace.\" So, I want Dwight, Morgan, Valentino and others in the community to know that we hear you. We are working hard to get Omnipod 5 into your hands and to make sure that everybody knows about and can benefit from this remarkable technology. Thanks again for joining us today. And have a great evening. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. And have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

The machine-assisted output provided is partly edited and is designed as a guide.: Operator : 00:10 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Insulet Corporation Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. 00:37 I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations. Deborah Gordon : 00:44 Thank you, Dalam. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for Insulet's fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. With me today are Shacey Petrovic, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Wayde McMillan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bret Christensen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer is also with us today for the Q&A portion of our call. Both, the replay of this call and the press release discussing our 2021 fourth quarter results and 2022 guidance will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. 01:19 Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such statements. 01:37 We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely adjusted EBITDA and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth excluding the effect of foreign exchange. These measures align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance, and we believe they are helpful to investors, analysts and other interested parties as measures of our operating performance from period to period. 02:04 Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis with the exception of revenue growth rates, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis. 02:18 With that, I'll turn the call over to Shacey. Shacey Petrovic : 02:21 Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. Our fourth quarter results mark the end of another year of strong growth, successful execution across our strategic imperatives and advancement of our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes around the world. 02:40 In 2021, we increased awareness and adoption of Omnipod in both the Type 1 and Type 2 markets, continued to unlock access through the U.S. pharmacy channel, expanded internationally and strengthened our global manufacturing operations. That momentum has continued into 2022 with the recent FDA clearance of Omnipod 5, which we could not be more excited about. 03:05 While 2021 was a strong year, it certainly wasn't without its challenges, including the ongoing impact of the pandemic, global supply chain shortages and growing AID competition, particularly in our international markets. It is wonderful to see the global diabetes community embrace automated insulin delivery technology, and it is a clear indicator of how well received we believe Omnipod 5 will be. We are making great progress with our commercial rollout in the U.S. and advancing our efforts to bring Omnipod 5 to our international markets. 03:40 The consistent strategic progress we have made is reflected in our financial results. In 2021, we surpassed $1 billion in annual revenue, in line with the goal we provided in 2016 as part of our long-range plan. 2021 also marked our sixth consecutive year of 20% or more revenue growth and we now serve approximately 300,000 global customers using Omnipod. 04:08 We are already off to a terrific start in 2022 with a critical milestone. The FDA clearance and commercial launch of Omnipod 5, the first tubeless automated insulin delivery system that offers full compatible smartphone control and an advanced algorithm residing on the Pod. It has taken incredible effort and commitment by the Insulet team to reach this ground breaking achievement. 04:35 Omnipod 5 marks the greatest and most complex innovation Insulet has brought to market in our company's 20-year history. It offers unmatched innovation with a patient preferred form factor and it strengthens the value we provide customers today through our pay-as-you-go business model and U.S. pharmacy access. These distinctive benefits should provide us with unique competitive advantages in the market and we'll deliver life-changing technology to our customers. 05:04 Taking a step back, diabetes is a growing epidemic and the global markets remain critically underserved with low pump utilization. However, people with diabetes are adopting wearable technology at an increasing rate as CGM use and awareness accelerates. Our efforts to improve access to and awareness of Omnipod along with our customer-centric approach to innovation are driving continued Omnipod adoption. 05:31 In the U.S., we continue to capture over 80% of our new customers from multiple daily injection and we remain a leader in the Type 2 market based on our form factor, the simplicity of our technology, demonstrated outcomes and broad affordable access through the pharmacy. Type 2 continues to represent between 35% and 40% of our new customers in the U.S. These trends offer significant growth opportunities for Insulet over the long-term, given Omnipod differentiated benefits, as well as our relentless focus on delivering a great customer experience. We expect to continue to drive Omnipod penetration, expand our total addressable market and grow our global market share. 06:17 I will now provide an update on our strategic imperatives, which include expanding access and awareness, delivering consumer focused innovation, growing our global addressable market and driving operational excellence. Expanding access to and awareness of Omnipod is essential to our strategy. Today for more people than ever Omnipod is available through our pay-as-you-go model in the U.S. pharmacy channel. 06:43 The pharmacy provides easier access and lower costs for the majority of our customers. Payers and Omnipod users are not burdened with four-year lock-in period. New technologies like Omnipod 5 can be adopted without upgrade or upfront fees and supplies can be picked up conveniently from a nearby pharmacy. For the payer, this means we assumed the risk through our pay-as-you-go business model, and for the Omnipod user it means easier access and affordability. 07:14 The enhanced experience in the pharmacy is great and is exactly why we are investing to expand access here. The primary driver of our growth over the last two years has been Omnipod DASH, and we have successfully secured broad access to this innovation globally. Almost all of our new customers in 2021 started on Omnipod DASH, and in the U.S., we've now secured almost 90% of covered lives for this product primarily in the pharmacy. 07:42 Essential to access is affordability. The vast majority of our U.S. consumers pay less than $50 each month for Omnipod DASH through the pharmacy, and the average is far less with many customers paying nothing. While the cost to users of Omnipod DASH is on par with multiple daily injections, Omnipod provides improved outcomes and quality of life. We continue to look for ways to reduce cost and the logistical and administrative hurdles for all customers, so they can access and afford Omnipod. 08:17 Our efforts to raise awareness through our direct-to-consumer advertising campaigns is also helping to drive adoption. Our programs across the U.S. and select international markets are ramping and continue to drive a positive response and contribute to our customer growth. In 2022, we planned to expand our DTC efforts to drive increased awareness of Omnipod DASH and now Omnipod 5. Given our success to date, we are excited to see the impact our DTC campaign will have once Omnipod 5 is fully launched. 08:48 Delivering the best customer experience is at the heart of what we do. For 15 years, we've been using our unique form factor to simplify diabetes management. Omnipod 5 takes our innovation to the next level. It is the world's first phone controlled Pod based AID system, and we are confident it will build on our history of improving diabetes management as we leapfrog all other AIG system on the market. 09:17 Full phone control is far beyond what others in the market have been working on. With full phone control, there is no separate controller and there is no traditional pump. The entire experience is on body and on phone. No tubes and no pulling out the pump to dismiss an alarm, change pump settings or prime an infusion set. Full phone control is the next level of simplicity and sophistication, and it is an experience that is only possible with a true wearable form factor like Omnipod. We've redefined the category of insulin delivery. 09:50 In addition to being the first tubeless fully smartphone controlled AID system, Omnipod 5 includes customizable set point our smart adjust algorithm on the pod and a novel bolus calculator. This level of innovation required unusually complex regulatory submission, including three 510(K)s, three lead reviewers at the agency and thousands of pages of data. Our limited market release has already begun and the early customers are over the moon. 10:24 Limited market releases are best practiced with launches of major new innovations and ours is designed to test our customer training and support system, build access and ensure the best possible customer experience upon full market release. In addition to product innovation, we have also transformed how users access Omnipod through the pharmacy. Customers can now enjoy a simple on-boarding process and a modernized customer service platform. 10:54 We can verify pharmacy benefits in seconds, streamline complex paperwork request, enable our field teams to manage their pipelines more efficiently and facilitate a 100% digital pathway to access our products. During 2021, our market access teams contracted strong coverage for Omnipod 5 prior to FDA clearance. And we are now able to move more swiftly to expand coverage further as many payors waited for clearance to established coverage policy. 11:26 We expect to be in limited release for three to nine months and are excited to rollout our system more broadly as the year progresses. We can't wait for everyone to experience the simplicity and improved outcomes enjoyed by our clinical study participants. Omnipod 5 is the most anticipated innovation within the diabetes community and our team is laser-focused on ensuring the system is available to everyone. 11:52 Shortly after clearance, we also delivered our FDA submission to expand Omnipod 5's indication down to age two. This is important as we know the tremendous benefits Omnipod 5 can provide this vulnerable population and their caregivers and we continue to plan for an expanded indication in 2022. We recently completed our Type 2 feasibility study and look forward to sharing results at the ATTV diabetes conference in April. 12:21 We will take the learnings from this study to design our pivotal study with the intent to deliver Omnipod 5 to the Type 2 diabetes. We have proven to be a pioneer in the Type 2 space and expect continued strong adoption given the benefits of Omnipod DASH, our U.S. pharmacy channel access and now Omnipod 5. Even as we launch Omnipod 5, we continue to strategically invest in a robust product pipeline. Omnipod 5 is a platform that you'll see us advance in the coming years. 12:52 Our iOS app development is making terrific progress as is our integration work with both DexCom's G7 and Abbott's FreeStyle Libre. Beyond Omnipod 5, we are focused in three areas. We are working on advancements that will grow our addressable market. We are developing next-generation AID technology, and we are creating digital innovations and data products to make diabetes management easier for our podders. 13:21 Over the last several years, we have built on and enriched our digital platform capabilities. With SIM cards in every Omnipod 5 controller and by better aggregating and analyzing user level data, we can further enhance the customer experience for all stakeholders. With these investments, we can improve outcomes, lessen the burden for both physicians and users by providing actionable insight and develop more advanced future product offering. These innovations will serve as another driver to secure Omnipod as the user preferred brand and strengthen our digital health capabilities. 13:59 We have a sharp focus on our growing intellectual property as we create innovative new technologies and build on our strong existing patent portfolio. In 2021, we filed more new patent applications than in any previous year. This will help ensure we are well positioned to deliver on our mission and provide differentiated and industry leading innovation to people with diabetes for decades to come. 14:24 This past year, we built upon our 2020 expansion efforts and the rollout of Omnipod DASH across our international markets through targeted geographic expansion. We entered the Asia Pacific region through our entry into Australia and also expanded into Turkey. These efforts broadened access to Omnipod and strengthened our foundation for future growth. We expect additional market expansion in 2022 in the Middle East. 14:52 Our efforts to deliver Omnipod 5 to our international markets are underway. We are making great progress and I'm happy to share that we submitted for CE marking in Europe. AID adoption is accelerating, and while it presenting near term headwind, increasing market acceptance, reimbursement pathways and awareness of these technologies bode well for Omnipod 5 once we launch in our international markets. We look forward to Omnipod 5 being the product of choice globally. 15:24 Many additional people around the world would benefit from Omnipod and we are focused on bringing it to them over time. We are building our international teams and advancing our regulatory reimbursement and market development efforts. Diabetes is underserved everywhere in the world and entering new markets represents a critical long-term growth driver for Insulet. 15:47 Investing in our manufacturing operations also remains a strategic priority as we build upon our established global capabilities and scale. We made great progress in 2021, including additional steps to strengthen our global manufacturing operations and to secure uninterrupted access to critical component creating a more resilient supply chain during these unprecedented times. We can produce 10s of millions of Pods a year and are extremely well positioned despite the challenging supply chain environment. 16:20 Our team continues to execute remarkably well successfully mitigating the impact on our business and on our customers. These efforts will support the full commercial release of Omnipod 5. The continued strong global demand we expect for Omnipod DASH and our growing innovation pipeline. Our growth plans in 2022 and the years ahead will not be constrained by capacity. 16:47 In closing, we finished another strong year and are extremely excited about 2022. We expect to fully launch Omnipod 5 this year in the U.S. We are advancing our strategy to bring Omnipod 5 to our international markets and we have an exciting and robust innovation roadmap. Our success is due to our talented team and their unwavering commitment to our mission. We have built an amazing company and an award winning culture. 17:17 This past year, we were named a great place to work in both the U.S. and the UK, while also separately being recognized as one of the Best Workplaces for Women. This past December, Druker's Institute listed Insulet as one of the top managed companies of 2021 based on customer satisfaction, employee engagement, innovation, social responsibility and financial strength. These recognitions in part because they come directly from employee and customer feedback are wonderful reminders of the power of our people and our positive impact on one another in our communities and on our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes. 17:58 I'll now turn the call over to Wayde. Wayde McMillan : 18:01 Thank you, Shacey. Our fourth quarter performance closed out another year of progress for Insulet on many fronts. Our focused investments and consistent execution of our strategic imperatives continue to strengthen our financial profile while driving meaningful value for all of our stakeholders. 18:20 In the fourth quarter, we generated 26% revenue growth finishing above our guidance range with record U.S. and global Omnipod new customer starts. On a reported basis for total revenue, foreign currency was a 70 basis point headwind over the prior year. We delivered U.S. Omnipod revenue growth of 28% also exceeding our guidance range. The trend of record U.S. new customer starts continued through the fourth quarter, a primary reason for our strong U.S. revenue growth. 18:55 Also contributing was our success driving volume growth through the pharmacy channel due to continued Omnipod DASH adoption. Omnipod DASH drove over 80% of our U.S. new customer starts and we increased pharmacy channel volume to almost 55% of our total U.S. volume. In Q4, International Omnipod revenue grew 6%, which was below our guidance range. Our growth was impacted by an estimated $5 million channel inventory reduction due to a European distributor returning to more normalized levels from the higher balanced carried throughout much of the pandemic. This occurred sooner than anticipated and it was not fully factored into our guidance. 19:42 It negatively impacted our Q4 growth rate by approximately 600 basis points. As a reminder, the majority of our revenue is sold through distributors in international regions, and fluctuations in inventory levels can impact our results. We also continue to be affected by increasing AID competition and the compounding impact of the pandemic on our annuity model. 20:07 On a reported basis for international Omnipod, foreign currency was a 180 basis point headwind over prior year. Our estimated global attrition and Pod utilization remained stable during Q4. Drug delivery revenue increased 113% during the fourth quarter finishing above our guidance range due to increased production volume driven by higher-than-expected demand from our partner. 20:34 Gross margin was 69.3% in the fourth quarter, representing a 380 basis point increase or 370 basis points on a constant currency basis. The primary drivers were the mix benefit of growing volume through the U.S. pharmacy channel, product mix in our improved manufacturing operations. These drivers were partially offset by an expected higher mix of costs as we further ramp U.S. manufacturing. 21:05 Our year-end inventory balance includes higher component costs as a result of inflationary pressure in 2021, and this is expected to continue in 2022. This will affect our gross margin in 2022 as we sell the product out of inventory. I will touch on that more in a few minutes. 21:27 Operating expenses were in line with our expectations as we continue to strategically invest in our innovation pipeline, sales and marketing capabilities, global manufacturing operations and international expansion. These investments are designed to fuel sustainable long-term growth and expand our total addressable market while we further advance our mission. Operating margin was 16.2% and adjusted EBITDA margin was 23.7%. Both showed an increase over prior year and were in line with our expectations as we grow profitably, while also investing across our business for long-term growth. 22:10 Turning to full year results, we delivered total Omnipod revenue growth of 19% and total company revenue growth of 20% achieving another record year at 1.1 billion demonstrating the strength and durability of our annuity model. On a reported basis, foreign currency was favorable to 2021 total revenue by 180 basis points. In 2021, we achieved gross margin of 68.4%, up 400 basis points and in line with our expectations. 22: 42 We are benefiting from our growing scale and global manufacturing efficiencies and mix benefit from growing volume through the U.S. pharmacy channel and we also had lower one-time costs associated with the pandemic. These drivers were partially offset by expected higher costs as we further ramp U.S. manufacturing. Operating margin was 11.5% up 580 basis points and adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.6%, up 340 basis points. Both were a significant step up from prior year and consistent with our expectations. 23:24 Turning to cash and liquidity, we ended the year with over $790 million in cash and the full $60 million available under our revolving credit facility. We entered 2022 in a strong financial position with a strategic roadmap to invest in critical areas of our business that will drive our innovation and growth for years to come. This past year, we took a series of steps to strengthen our capital structure and reduce our overall cost of capital. We are well positioned to finance our growth strategy. 24:01 More recently in the current quarter, we finalized the strategic vertical integration acquisition of one of our suppliers, which brings key intellectual property and expertise in-house, allowing us to strengthen our competitive moat, production capabilities and efficiency and drive further operational excellence while mitigating supply chain risks. We have also taken additional steps to strengthen our global manufacturing capabilities. We have optimized operations in China by consolidating production in that region into one location. We also plan to invest in a new international manufacturing location to further diversify globally and increase efficiency consistent with our goal to drive higher gross margins over time. 24:51 Now turning to our outlook for 2022 for the full year, we expect total Omnipod revenue growth of 15% to 20% and total company revenue growth of 12% to 16%, by product line, we expect U.S. Omnipod revenue growth of 18% to 23%. Our growth within Type 1 and Type 2 markets will be driven primarily by Omnipod DASH volume growth and our unique pay-as-you-go model and pharmacy channel access. We will also benefit from the commercial release of Omnipod 5 and we anticipate this latest innovation will begin to contribute to growth this year and even more so over the long term. 25:39 We expect growth to be higher in the second half of the year versus the first half as we gain momentum from the launch of Omnipod 5, begin to move past pandemic headwinds and realize the benefits of other commercial investments. As a reminder, the launch of Omnipod 5 and its adoption ramp will take time due to the nature of our annuity model and given we are in limited market release for a period of time before transitioning to full market release. 26:10 For international Omnipod, we expect full year 2022 revenue growth in the range of 9% to 14%, driven by ongoing DASH adoption, partially offset by the impact of AID competition and pandemic related headwinds. We expect international to remain a long-term strategic growth driver and we will continue investing with a focus to expand our global footprint and to bring Omnipod 5 to our international markets. 26:40 We expect international revenue growth to also be higher in the second half of the year versus the first half resulting from a slightly easier comparison, as well as expected improving conditions related to COVID. For drug delivery, we expect revenue to decline 30% to 35% as levels were elevated during the pandemic. 27:04 Turning to gross margin for full year 2022, we expect to achieve gross margin of 67% to 68% and expect it to be higher in the first half of the year as compared to the second half. We expect the decline from prior year is driven by product mix, including ramping Omnipod 5 volume, higher costs associated with our U.S. manufacturing ramp and higher component and manufacturing costs associated with inflation. 27:36 We expect this to be partially offset by the benefits of our strengthened global manufacturing operations and capabilities and increasing volume in the U.S. pharmacy channel. Looking beyond 2022, we fully expect to continue to expand gross margin over the long term as we begin to see the full benefit of our scale and manufacturing efficiencies. We still see 70% gross margin as a near-to mid-term goal and we are driving toward it. 28:04 During 2022, we expect operating expenses to rise slightly below our revenue growth as we further invest in key areas of our business while progressing our financial profitability. This includes investments in our robust innovation and clinical pipelines, increased direct-to-consumer marketing and further scaling other commercial-related activities. We are also experiencing inflationary pressure within operating expenses. 2022 will be a pivotal year as we launch Omnipod 5 and strengthen our position in a large and rapidly expanding market that remains under-penetrated. We continue to invest heavily in innovation as our team advances Omnipod 5 internationally, our iOS development effort integration with Libre and G7 and much more. 28:57 This year to make the most of our Omnipod 5 launch, we expect the majority of operating expense growth will be within SG&A. Even with our increased investments and pressure from inflation, we continue to target operating margin expansion of approximately 100 basis points each year, which is our goal over the short and mid-term as we invest in long-term strategic growth drivers. 29:23 At the start of 2022, we adopted new accounting guidance that reduces most of the non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible notes to an insignificant amount, cash interest expense remains unchanged at approximately 30 million per year. Finally, we expect capital expenditures in 2022 will grow slightly from 2021 with continued investment throughout our business. 29:50 Turning now to our first quarter 2022 revenue guidance. We expect both total company growth and total Omnipod growth of 13% to 16%. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect growth of 17% to 20%. We expect the core drivers will be the benefits of our recurring revenue model following consistent record setting new customer starts in 2021, an additional Omnipod DASH volume through the U.S. pharmacy channel. 30:25 We expect Q1 international Omnipod growth of 6% to 10% driven by continued Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by AID competition and the compounding impact from lower new customer starts in 2021 largely due to the pandemic. Finally, we expect Q1 drug delivery revenue growth of 20% to 25%. Q1 is expected to be higher than each of the subsequent quarters in the year due to production timing. 30:56 In conclusion, we completed another solid year of growth and strategic progress. The U.S. Omnipod 5 is launched, the preschool expanded indication filing is under active review at the FDA, we are advancing our Type 2 initiatives and our efforts to bring Omnipod 5 to our international markets are progressing. We expect 2022 to be a transformative year as we advance our strategy and build upon our existing competitive advantages to position Insulet for sustainable growth for years to come. 31:28 With that, we will turn the call over to Dalam to open the call for questions. Operator : 31:34 Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Jayson Bedford : 32:07 Hi. Good afternoon and congrats on the approval. I wanted to the start on the international side. If I add back the $5 million to the fourth quarter in terms of the inventory got down, the international is still down quarter-on-quarter, and is it just a function way to -- the inventory build in 2Q and 3Q that just got unwind (ph) within the fourth quarter and I guess just more specifically will be install base on a net basis increase over the last few quarters and then if there has been internet pricing changes in international markets, so it is still kind of related to the same question. Wayde McMillan : 32:50 Sure. Hi, Jason. Thanks for the question. And we certainly are experiencing more tailwinds and momentum in the U.S. business in the international business, as you call out, we had this channel impact, it's something we've been monitoring actually throughout 2020. We had seen a distributor carrying higher inventory balances throughout the pandemic. And we were unexpectedly hit with it at the end of the quarter because in conversations with them, we didn't think they\u2019re going to be taking it down, but they did. So we didn't including guidance, as you said, it takes our growth rate, if you normalize for that up to about 12%. So pretty consistent with the growth that we've had throughout the year, 13% to 14% and so there is nothing really a regular to call out other than just normal order patterns with our distributors. 33:45 Most of our business internationally is through distributors and so it will ebb and flow between the quarters. So overall, our growth for the year ended up quarter-by-quarter over the four quarters between 12% and 14%, so pretty consistent. And as you know, we target low 20% growth to high-teens growth. And we've been off that over the last year for a couple of main reasons. Obviously, the pandemic has persisted longer and then an impact on our new customer starts, as well as the AID competition that we've called out as CGM has got approval in certain countries, AID systems are starting to take off. And as we've said in our prepared remarks, Shacey highlighted that we can't wait to get Omnipod 5 in international markets and participate in the segment of the market that's growing with AID. So that's the run down on our international business. 34:38 It's still strong growth, the base of business is growing. We're still double-digits to mid-to low-teens growth there, and we can't wait to bring more innovation with Omnipod 5 and get back into that targeted range where we think we can sustain that high-teens to low 20s type of growth. Operator : 34:59 Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings from Cowen. Please go ahead. Unidentified Participant : 35:06 Thank you. This is Eric on for Josh. With your announcement today that you've submitted for CE Mark of Omnipod 5. Could you help us understand any milestones or timelines for O5 to receive an approval decision there? Is it safe to assume that an approval could be delivered in the second half of this year? And then I'll ask the follow-up to that now, you said that the U.S. limited launch will be three to five months, should we expect a similar timeline in the EU once you have CE Mark in hands. Shacey Petrovic : 35:33 Great. Thanks, Eric for the question. Yes, we are excited to be under active review for CE Mark. We don't really have a timeline to share beyond that as you may know, this is a new regulatory pathway, the Medical Device Regulation pathway and obviously a complex submission. We know that data looks great and we're very confident in the quality of the submission, but it could take some time for us to secure this approval. So, we haven't given guidance for timing. Just wanted to let everybody know that we are under active review and looking forward to getting that out onto the market. 36:12 In terms of what the limited market release will look like, we are still finalizing that strategy, it's very likely that we would enter into select markets as part of the limited market release and then expand from there, very similar to how we rolled out DASH in our international markets where we started with a handful of markets as part of the limited market release and then expanded from there. Thanks for the question. Operator : 36:39 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Robbie Marcus : 36:45 Great. Thanks for taking the questions. So I was wondering if you could just elaborate on the limited launch and the impact it's having on user buying patterns and new patient starts. U.S. had a good fourth quarter, but I would say first quarter is looking a little below where the Street was thinking for the U.S. and for the full year as well. So would love to just get a sense of what you're seeing in those buying patterns and if patients are waiting. Shacey Petrovic : 37:22 Sure, Robbie. Maybe I'll start and then Wayde can speak to what's factored into the guidance for Q1. But it's just been a few weeks and the limited market release is progressing exactly as planned. I think feedback from those participating in it has been terrific and we're getting the early insights that we are looking for as we had said, what we're looking for is sort of testing our training pathways are onboarding our product experience, all while the team continues to build access. And so, so far so good, although it is early days, but we are encouraged. And as it relates to buying patterns, I think you would look at the fourth quarter in the U.S., which was very strong and ahead of our expectations and it doesn't -- it wouldn't indicate that people are waiting for Omnipod 5 just given how strong the quarter was. I'm sure there are people out there that are waiting for Omnipod 5 to get onto Omnipod, but certainly the performance in the fourth quarter would indicate that. Wayde McMillan : 38:28 Great. And regarding guidance Robbie, one thing we have to keep in mind when we compare Q4 to Q1 is the seasonality, particularly in the U.S. and a couple of years ago, we thought that that may wane somewhat with move up volume into the pharmacy channel, but similar to what we experienced last year from 2020 into '21 and is that there are just inherent built-in behaviors in people start stocking up with more pods in Q4 and driving seasonality higher in Q4. And then, as a result lower in Q1. 39:08 So we're following those similar trends in our guidance, and we'll wait and see if in fact that does wane this year or not, but our expectation is, given the strength of the utilization in Q4 and what we learned last year of just what's built into the marketplace and people buying behavior that we'll still see pretty strong behavior -- pretty strong buying behavior in Q4, even though we've moved good percentage over half of our volume into the pharmacy channel. Operator : 39:39 Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Lawrence Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Lawrence Biegelsen : 39:48 Hi. Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. Shacey, did I hear you say the limited launch would be three to nine months or three to five months. Shacey Petrovic : 39:55 Three to nine. We haven't changed our estimate on that. That's what we've been saying all along. Lawrence Biegelsen : 40:01 And so my question is kind of what gets you to kind of the why such a wide range what would get you to the low end of that versus the high end of that, if you will, the nine months and what is the goal for covered lives, you start exiting 2022. Thanks for taking my question. Shacey Petrovic : 40:19 Yeah. Thanks, Larry. So moving through to full market release is really dependent on just getting the number of days of use across our different customer journeys. So we have MDI users getting onboard, traditional tube pump users getting onboard, people coming from Omnipod and people who are coming from CGM or CGM naive. So we look across each of those and want to confirm the training pathways, we want to confirm the on-boarding pathways and of course, the product experience. So if all of that goes flawlessly, then we'll be at three months. If we learned some things in that that we want to address, then that may push us closer to six or nine months. 41:05 And while we're doing that, we're also working to build access. And so once we've got the customer experience, where we want it, and then we've got access where we want it, which we don't expect really to be a governing factor that's when will move into full market release. We just know there's going to be enthusiastic demand out there and we want to make sure we've got the best possible customer experience in best possible access position. And so I guess three months really would assume that we recruit everybody at the pace that we want to and that the experience is flawless and nine months would assume that we're learning some things that we want to address. Bret Christensen : 41:45 Yeah, Larry. Its Bret. I'll just add that one of the reasons why it's important is, we want to move quickly at the full market release. And so some of the systems that we're testing during the LMR or the ordering process, the onboarding process, both of which provide tremendous amount of self-service for our users. Remember, we don't have a four-year lock-in period with our user base and so there's going to be a tremendous amount of demand from existing podders to move to Omnipod 5. We want them to be able to self-serve, and it\u2019s a self-start on the product and so the reason why those systems need to move go flawlessly as Shacey puts is so we can move really quickly and continue to focus on new starts during the FMR. 42:25 And so what we're testing those two parts of the system along with access as you mentioned, but access is going to be probably not the limiting factor to get to full market release, because we had a head start, we were said that we were ahead -- well ahead of where we were at with DASH before we launched that product. So access will probably be an acceptable level. And once we get comfortable with those two systems, the ordering and on-boarding process that will enable us to move really quickly during FMR. Operator : 42:53 Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Please go ahead. Unidentified Participant : 43:01 Hi. This is Brandon on for Margaret. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to focus on the 2022 guidance. There is a lot of moving pieces. A lot of good and exciting things going on through the year. So I was wondering, if you could just talk about what is and what is not factored into that guidance. And I guess the three maybe things that I would focus on are one what's factored in for the global or let's say a cadence of global launch of Omnipod 5. What are you considering for a mix of Type 2 as a percent of users. And then maybe DTC investments, what are those factored into guidance is kind of ramping up. So, any color around those dynamics and what is and what is not factored in the guidance would be helpful. Wayde McMillan : 43:46 Hi. Sure, Brandon. Its Wayde, I can start that one, and then I'm sure, Bret would like to jump in on a couple of the business drivers that you mentioned. So our 2022 guide for the U.S. 18% to 23%, very strong guide in fact at the high end similar to the growth we had in 2021 off of much higher base and in across all of our high-end guidance product lines U.S. International, we achieved the high end, they will be record setting revenue basis for us again. And so even though the percentages are slightly lower than last year, the dollar growth rates are really what we need to keep an eye on given the size of our existing base from year-to-year and so specific things that are in the guidance, obviously in the U.S. we are including the launch of Omnipod 5. 44:41 What we have scenarios running on and have to watch is just as Shacey and Bret talked about whether we're at the low end three months and where the full market release or if it takes us to nine months. And given the annuity model that we sell-through in the pharmacy channel with our pay-as-you-go model, it is a pretty significant difference to the year whether we get it at the three months or at the nine months, end of the range. And so that's something we'll be monitoring very closely throughout the year. The mix of Type 2 is interesting, again it will be Omnipod 5 dependent. We've been pretty consistent at 35% to 40% of our new customer starts have been Type 2 over the last few quarters and throughout 2021 and so that's what we would expect it to be. However as Omnipod 5 ramps and Omnipod 5 has Type 1 indication as Shacey said in our prepared remarks we're working on Type 2. So we do think that the type 2 mix could be lower as Omnipod 5 ramps, given that it's indicated for Type 1 only at this point in time. 45:43 And then from a DTC standpoint, we have had really good success in driving an increasing awareness for our products. Bret maybe you could talk to where the market stands today on lack of awareness and why we think DTC is still a strong driver for us. Bret Christensen : 46:00 Yeah. Thanks, Wayde. So I think once we get to Omnipod 5 what we really will have the most complete offering. We pointed to the lack of an AID system is being a headwind for us, not just internationally, but the U.S., but we've had these tailwinds of pharmacy Type 2 and DTC and in my mind, when we add AID now to the best form factor in the marketplace in Omnipod awareness becomes the next frontier for us. So we've already made tremendous strides in DTC, TV commercials, our learnings in converting those leads that come in to new starts have been tremendous. 46:40 And I look forward to the improved messaging in the addition of AID to Omnipod. That should be an enhancement to DTC at a better message and should drive even better conversion rates. So it\u2019s something we'll continue to do. We look forward to doing it throughout the year. And you'll see our message evolve as we approach the full market release of Omnipod 5 to include that AID message in those TV commercials. Shacey Petrovic : 47:04 And Brandan just one note, although we are really excited to have them both under active review, the preschool expansion and international Omnipod 5 are not factored into our guidance. Operator : 47:17 Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Baird. Please go ahead. Jeff Johnson : 47:25 Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Shacey you just kind of took my last question there on whether or not Omnipod 5 was in international markets. But let me ask, kind of, I guess maybe a more detailed international question. So I know that MDR pathway is tough to predict. Do we think is six to 12 months a conservative window anyway to put any kind of guide rails on that at all number one, but more importantly, once you do get CE Mark and let's just -- let's say it's July 1 or something like that, if that were to happen, is there another six-month window we have to think about, 12-month window to think about. What's the window that didn't get on reimbursement in some of your largest countries whether that's France or Germany or I think UK something like that, how long would it take to actually get reimbursed for O5 so that it could start contributing more meaningfully to your international revenue? Thanks. Shacey Petrovic : 48:12 Yeah, Jeff. It's such a good question because there is a lot of work in terms of market development and we talk about Europe or international as if it's one thing, but we all know, Europe is 20 for us, 20 plus different countries, different business models, different market registrations and different reimbursement pathways. The good news is we have that work underway. So we have teams who are doing the market development work today, but there will be work, depending on the market, some will go faster and some will go slower in terms of establishing coverage and access for Omnipod 5. So I can't really put a window on MDR. We are one of -- it's still early days for MDR, and so the pathway is just not that established. We're very confident in the submission. And we are under review, but it's one of the reasons why it's not built into guidance this year. It's just -- it's an unpredictable pathway at this point. We will let you know obviously as we make progress there. 49:12 And I would say we will move into a market release that looks -- limited market release that looks fairly similar to what we have in the U.S., just based on the need to do that remaining market development work in terms of establishing access and market registrations, et cetera, once we have CE Mark. Operator : 49:38 Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from Citi. Please go ahead. Joanne Wuensch : 49:45 Good evening and thank you for taking the question. You certainly have a lot going on, but I do want to ask about Libre 3 and G7. And it's a two-part question. How long do you think it takes to integrate it with Omnipod 5 and is that something that needs to be submitted by you buy them or what's the regulatory pathway? Shacey Petrovic : 50:13 Great. Joanne, yeah, it's a very exciting pipeline, we've talked now today about preschoolers and the international launch, and of course, CGM integrations, Type 2 and iOS, so there is a lot going on very exciting. I think everything is progressing well. The work to integrate with G7 and with Libre has been underway for quite some time. And so that is making good progress there. Based on ICGM pathway and clearance for DexCom and G7 there should not be actually a regulatory submission. That's one of the beautiful things about the interoperable pathway. And so that should go relatively straightforward and the long pole in the tent there really is the technical work. 51:04 And right now, Libre may require likely to require a submission, that work is underway as well. We own those submission, so it's our responsibility to work with our partners to do the development work and get the regulatory clinical and technical support that we need and then those submissions would be ours to manage. Operator : 51:28 Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy from SVB Leerink. Please go ahead. Danielle Antalffy : 51:35 Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question and I haven't had a chance to congratulate you on Omnipod 5 approval, very exciting. I have a two-part question. So first internationally, I'm just curious if you could talk a little bit more about why AID's are still much more competitive internationally versus the U.S., I mean you guys have still had very strong growth in the U.S., I appreciate with an AID more competitive. But it feels like the pressure is greater internationally. 52:07 And then the second part of the question is on limited market release and sort of how, what exactly you're looking to learn. Is that how to best train the patients and the clinicians, is it looking for patient feedback, is it about patients selection. We just love a little bit more color about the learnings that come from the limited market release. Thank you so much. Shacey Petrovic : 52:26 Yeah. Thanks, Danielle. And maybe I'll start with a limited market release question and then Brett can give some insight into the international market dynamics around AID. For the limited market release, what we're really looking to understand as Brett said, remember we don't lock our users into four-year agreements. And so that means that everybody who has market access and coverage and has access to Omnipod 5. So that's could be 10s of thousands, if not more than 100,000 users in the United States. And so we certainly want them to be able to get onto product, but we want them to be able to self-serve, so there are training pathways that are purely virtual for these different patient segments. 53:12 So if you are on Omnipod today and DexCom, you should not even need to meet with a clinician or a physician to be able to get onto the product, you need a prescription and to go through our training pathways. So that's an example of something that we want to test that pathway, make sure that everybody is satisfied and having a good experience and good success with the product after the training. And then there are a myriad of other patient pathways, the MDI user will have a different training pathway that does involve for example meeting with a physician and most of this is really focused on the user as opposed to the clinician, the product itself is incredibly simple, it's been designed to be as hands off as possible for the physician's office and to be very simple to use for the patient. So those are the types of things that we are testing and we just need to make sure that we get a good amount of patients across each of those patient pathways. 54:06 And then we have good feedback and confidence in the experience across each of those pathways, and then of course, we're building access in the background. But those are the types of things that we're looking to test. And then I'll ask Brett to take the second part of your question. Bret Christensen : 54:20 Yeah. Hi, Danielle. Its Bret. For AID competition internationally I know it does appear that it's stronger than it was in the U.S., but a couple of things. One, we've had AID competition in the U.S. for about six years now. So it's just been something we've been living with and there are tailwinds in the U.S. that have helped us, it just don't exist to the same extent in our international markets and those are really three things, one is Type 2, remember with 35% to 40% of all of our new starts coming from Type 2 that doesn't exist internationally. And if so, if you were to take that out of the U.S. number you'd see significantly lower results with new starts, that's one. 55:02 The second is really the pharmacy lift. So both the pharmacy experience as well as the premium we get of pricing of Pods in the pharmacy channel, it helps our revenues in the U.S. And the third really is DTC that's been really significant for us over the last few years, it's been a significant spend. It's not really available to all of our markets outside the U.S. So that's something that -- although it's something we've tried in markets like Germany, Canada, it's not something we can do everywhere. And then, yeah, just that the pay-as-you-go models that really is the benefit, the pharmacy in the U.S. is something we're working on in our international markets, but just not to the extent that we have it today. So AID is new in our international markets. So it's a change and something that we're feeling today and we just got to work on those tailwinds, so that we have that list between now and when we launch Omnipod 5 to compete better internationally. Operator : 55:59 Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor from UBS. Please go ahead. Matt Taylor : 56:07 Thank you for taking the question. I saw that you had said in the prepared remarks that you're making progress on the iOS development, Apple development. Could you just give us an update there and talk about next steps and any color on timing that you can give for that. Shacey Petrovic : 56:27 Sure, Matt. Yeah. Thanks for the question. We do -- we have had the iOS work underway for a while and there is no timeline update there, but I can tell you that the work is going well and we certainly are excited about it. Our plan has always been to take the learnings from our limited market release with our phone control on Android and factor those into the submission, and the launch plan for iOS. And so we do want to wait to get through that, before we would end up submitting, but right now, that's not the long pole in the tent, it's likely to be the completion of the technical work. This does require a 510(K) submission. So we are going to wrap up our technical work and then factor in any learnings from our limited market release with Android full phone control and then submit that for 510(K) clearance to the FDA. Operator : 57:24 Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Steve Lichtman from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Steve Lichtman : 57:33 Thank you. Hi, everyone. Just wondering how we should think about the potential for Omnipod 5 to positively impact new patient flow even before the full launch, I think, Shacey, you've talked in the past about given no capital upfront that people who are on Omnipod can switch to 5 once available, does that provide an opportunity for you, even if you're not explicitly building it into 2022 guidance. Shacey Petrovic : 58:06 Yeah. Thanks for the question, Steve. I guess I would point to Q4 as an example or an illustration of the fact that I think people get the business model, right. What we are trying to avoid there is a slowdown before a new innovation launches and just helping educate clinicians and customers that they can get on the product and they'll be able to convert over to Omnipod 5 once their insurer covers the product. And I think the main focus there is to ensure that we don't see a step back as we bring new innovation to market and I think Q4 is illustrative of the fact that people get it and they're not delaying their choice to get on product as we get closer and closer to the launch of Omnipod 5. So I wouldn't necessarily look at it as an upside, but I think it's a great indication of the power of the business model that we don't slow down as we bring new innovation to market and that's very exciting. It's a great thing for patients and it's a great thing for Insulet. Bret Christensen : 59:06 Yeah. Steve, this is Bret. Part of our message to both health care providers and patients is that, the quickest pathways Omnipod 5 is to be on DASH today because there is self-service training component for anybody that's on DASH. So the training doesn't become a bottleneck for anybody that wants to start on Omnipod 5 right away. The best thing they really can't do is start on DASH today go through the training, so that when Omnipod 5 comes out in a full market release fashion they're able to self-serve on that training and more quickly onboard with Omnipod 5. So that's the message that's resonating. Shacey [indiscernible] agree it's not really driving additional new starts, but it is preventing people from waiting, which is what we're trying to do. Wayde McMillan : 59:53 Yeah. And then, Steve, I could just pick up on the guidance part of that question. The way to think about it is, if we're at the shorter three to six months end of the limited market release period that helps push us to the higher end of the guide. If we end up more in that six to nine months\u2019 timeframe, then that's one of the reasons that could push us to the lower end of the guide. And then, obviously depending on how successful we are with Omnipod 5 throughout the year it starts to build into our annuity model and can help us at the end of the year or as we build momentum into 2023. Operator : 60:28 Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Matthew O'Brien: 60:36 Good Afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. So we say six months for the limited market release that gets us to kind of August, early September. I mean it's kind of dovetails off what Steve was just asking about the conversion factor. Are you going to be able to kind of go full bore after new patients with O5 right away or are you reps really going to be spending a lot of time figuring how to convert existing patients to O5? And so they're really not going to able to get after selling Omnipod 5 to new patients until probably more so in 2023. Thanks. Bret Christensen : 61:15 Yeah, Matt. Hi. This is Bret. I can take that one. Our sales reps are compensated on new starts and new to Omnipod starts. So they're going to want to focus on really building our customer base and starting brand new users that are coming from MDI or from a tube pump conversion that are new to Omnipod. Those tools that we talked about both the ordering process and the on-boarding process should allow them to do that to focus solely on new starts. That is our intent. As we think about this pay-as-you-go model, this no upfront fee and patients will always be able to upgrade to the latest Omnipod technology, that's a good thing. And it's one of the reasons why we've been spending years now building these self-service tools in anticipation for the launch of Omnipod 5, so that we can innovate in short cycles and people will always be able to self-serve and upgrade to the latest version of Omnipod. And so that is our intent, it is one of the reasons why we've put this range on the LMR because we've got to test those system, so we've had people on product remember for over a year. We're pretty confident that Omnipod 5 is a fantastic product that people love it. These systems develop ordering and onboarding our new and we're testing this in the LMR because that is our intent, we want the sales and marketing teams to focus on new starts and we want existing partners to really quickly migrate to Omnipod 5 on their own. Operator : 62:35 Thank you. I'm showing our last question in the queue comes from Kyle Rose from Canaccord. Please go ahead. Kyle Rose : 62:44 Great. Good evening, everyone, and thanks for fitting me in. So I wanted to just ask a more of a bigger picture I guess business model question. Wayde, I think you reiterated the comment about future years of leverage being in the ballpark of 100 bps. And I guess I'm just trying to understand if you could unpack that for us just a little bit, when I think about the work you're doing on manufacturing. I think about the some of the investments you're making. I understand that they take investments upfront, but they do appear to be more scalable long-term thinking, things like the pharmacy channel, patient led onboarding, DTC advertising. I guess maybe what additional investments from a fixed cost or an infrastructure perspective, need to be put in place that would kind of constrain that to only 100 bps year-over-year moving forward assuming the topline growth is there. Wayde McMillan : 63:34 Yeah. Good afternoon, Kyle. And this is key to our financial thesis. The summary level is that we see ourselves in a very differentiated position in a leadership position within a very large total available market here both the Type 1 and the Type 2 and a leadership position in it, and so we want to be able to continue to invest to capitalize on that leadership position and so we're going to do that through major areas. Our R&D being one of the largest one of the ones you didn't mentioned, but significant investments in driving innovation for years to come. As Shacey said in our prepared remarks, we've talked publicly about a lot of the projects that we have that now have clinical submission timelines. But of course, behind that, our pipeline is also being invested in for significant advancements in further generations of our current products for TAM expansion, for international expansion. So just a lot coming in the pipeline. So heavy investment in R&D to continue in this -- to continue penetrating in this large available market for us. 64:46 And then as you mentioned manufacturing, I want to make sure capacity stays ahead obviously. You mentioned leveraging the pharmacy channel. You're right, it is a more efficient channel for us. We've got over half of our volume flowing through the pharmacy now and so we are getting benefits from that. But as Brett mentioned earlier, we're also making investments in direct-to-consumer, we see pretty heavy lift to drive awareness and that the majority of the market for Type 2 and almost all the -- pardon me -- for Type 1 and almost all of the market for Type 2 is still more people who are using multiple daily injections, and so we've got a big job to do in developing the market and DTC is one of the areas that we're going to do that, but we're also continuing to invest in our sales force to drive those initiatives in both the Type 1 and Type 2 space. 65:32 And then the other major area of investment is on the international expansion side, which is pretty significant investment, as Shacey highlighted earlier around the regulatory and government affairs, as well as all the capabilities needed to deliver our product in those regions. And so we see ourselves continuing in this heavy investment cycle, but as you mentioned, we also want to continue to strengthen our financial profile. We had a nice step-up in operating margins and EBITDA this year and we did that intentionally to get ourselves to a place where we're much stronger financially and now we're going to build on that, from year-to-year. And we're targeting 100 basis points of improvement each year and we're going to continue to step our way to that stronger financial profile. So that's the plan for us over time, continuing to take advantage of our leadership in differentiated position here. While also building a stronger financial profile for the company. Operator : 66:29 Thank you sir, I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Shacey Petrovic for closing. Shacey Petrovic : 66:36 Thank you, Dalam. I want to take a moment to share some of the unsolicited and wonderful feedback we've received from Omnipod 5 users during what has been just a few weeks of limited market release. Bethany, mother of a one-year-old shared a quote, Omnipod 5 has allowed me to be more present for my son, because I'm not constantly thinking about my own diabetes; and Kevin, father of a 16-year-old is a laided about how Omnipod 5 has changed their lives. He shared a quote today with the third morning in a row my son woke up with perfect blood sugar and no overnight lows. Omnipod 5 is a dream come true. And finally John, who has been on a pump for over two decades shared his lifetime of personal challenges and frustration managing has diabetes. In his words, quote diabetes has taken its toll on me mentally I bottled up and try to stay strong for my wife, my kids and those who love me I am tired. With Omnipod 5 I've slept through the night uninterrupted for the first time in a very long time. Thank you for all your hard work to make this dream a reality. So we cannot wait to bring Omnipod 5 and its unmatched benefits to the broader diabetes community. So that it can help millions of more people just like it's doing for Bethany, Kevin and John and their families. Thanks again for joining us today and have a great evening. Operator *: 68:04 Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participation and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations. Deborah Gordon : Thank you, Dalam. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Insulet's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. With me today are Shacey Petrovic, President and Chief Executive Officer; Wayde McMillan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Hollingshead, member of Insulet's Board of Directors and Insulet's future President and CEO. Shacey and Wayde, along with Bret Christensen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, will be available for the Q&A portion of our call. Both the replay of this call and the press release discussing our 2022 first quarter results and 2022 guidance will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such statements. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely adjusted EBITDA and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth excluding the effect of foreign exchange. These measures align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance, and we believe they are helpful to investors, analysts and other interested parties as measures of our operating performance from period to period. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis with the exception of revenue growth rates, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis. With that, I'll turn the call over to Shacey. Shacey Petrovic : Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we turn to our first quarter results, I'd like to take a moment to talk about this afternoon's announcement that for personal reasons, I will be stepping down from my executive positions at Insulet. After careful consideration over some time, I have made the very difficult decision to reduce my professional obligations in light of medical issues and other circumstances that have been impacting my family and those I care deeply about. Effective June 1, Jim Hollingshead, a member of our Board of Directors since 2019, will succeed me as President and CEO. I am extremely proud of what we have accomplished in my time as CEO. We have made significant strides to improve the lives of people with diabetes while enhancing Insulet's ability to innovate and operate with excellence. Insulet is well positioned for the full U.S. commercial launch of Omnipod 5 and poised for continued growth and impact for shareholders and the diabetes community. I remain profoundly committed to Insulet and the company's long-term success, and I look forward to continuing to serve as a director on Insulet's Board and as an adviser to Jim and the team. I will be working hand-in-hand with Jim to ensure a seamless transition of leadership responsibilities. In recent years, we have made great progress improving the lives of people with diabetes by delivering consumer-focused innovation, growing the company's global addressable market and driving operational excellence. Hundreds of thousands of Podders around the world are leading happier and healthier lives because of our work and dedication. And with Omnipod 5, we will offer significantly improved outcomes and incredibly simplified diabetes management to millions of people across the globe. I have never been more excited or confident about Insulet's future. Insulet has a deep, talented team and is firing on all cylinders and poised for incredible growth. I know Jim well from our service on the Insulet Board together, and I'm delighted that he is the one to step into the role of CEO at this important time. The company will be in great hands under his leadership. He knows our company, our culture and our team and the strong relationships he has fostered with our management team will immediately serve the company well and ensure a smooth transition. His significant experience at the rapidly evolving crossroads of medical technology and digital solutions will also be incredibly valuable to the company. Jim has joined us today, and I'd like to turn the call over to him for a few remarks. Jim Hollingshead : Thank you, Shacey. Shacey and I have built a terrific working relationship, and I'm very pleased that she will continue to serve on Insulet's Board and in addition, serve in an advisory role with the company. Shacey's continued active involvement and oversight will be incredibly valuable. This gives me great confidence that we won't miss a beat. Under Shacey's remarkable leadership, Insulet has delivered tremendous growth. The company has pioneered innovations that deliver on our mission to simplify and improve the lives of people with diabetes, and I will work hard to build on that legacy. On a personal note, I'm excited to spend a lot more time in our company's headquarters. I plan to get a place here and also maintain my residence in Southern California, near Insulet's operations in San Diego and Tijuana. I am also looking forward to getting out on the road over the next several months to meet with Insulet's amazing employees as well as the company's business partners, analysts, investors and other stakeholders. In closing, I am honored to assume the role of President and CEO of Insulet at this important time, and I'm energized by working alongside our excellent leadership team and talented employees to continue advancing our mission and strategic imperatives. We are well positioned to build on Insulet's momentum to drive significant value for shareholders and to continue to execute our mission. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Shacey for commentary on the quarter. Shacey Petrovic : Thanks, Jim. We are off to a great start in 2022 with financial results that finished ahead of expectations as our team continues to execute and build on the momentum in our business. We, once again, had record Q1 U.S. and global new customer starts in the first quarter, building on our success throughout 2021. We have meaningfully advanced our strategic imperatives and are on track for another successful year. Our position in the underserved global diabetes market has never been stronger. We are especially excited about the overwhelmingly positive feedback we have received during our limited market release from users of Omnipod 5, the first tubeless automated insulin delivery system with full compatible smartphone control. The feedback has been nothing short of spectacular. Users love the system and have shared how it greatly simplifies their diabetes management and is truly changing their lives. HCP feedback has been equally strong. Our efforts to bring Omnipod 5 to our international markets are well underway, including our CE mark submission under active review, and we continue to expand our global presence. We also recently shared compelling data from our type 2 feasibility study at the ATTD diabetes conference, which demonstrates the value Omnipod 5 can bring to the type 2 community. Omnipod offers an unmatched option for people living with type 2 diabetes given our pay-as-you-go model, pharmacy access, attractive form factor, growing clinical evidence and unparalleled simplicity. In the first quarter, type 2 users represented approximately 35% of our U.S. new customer starts. Our competitive advantages and exciting innovation pipelines in both the type 1 and type 2 market segments position us to drive long-term revenue growth, increase our market share and total addressable market and expand our margins. Also, last week, we published our 2021 sustainability report to provide all of our stakeholders a view into Insulet's approach to environmental, social and governance programs and the exciting progress we've made across a number of fronts. Just a few examples. In 2021, we reached 60% gender diversity on Insulet's Board, millions of used pods were diverted from landfills globally through product take-back programs and solar panels at our Massachusetts headquarters generated almost 800,000 kilowatt hours of renewable energy. Insulet is committed to the 3 pillars of our sustainability strategy : resilient operations, sustainable product innovation and people and communities. And it is encouraging to see us continue to mature across each of these areas. Now turning to an update on our strategic imperatives, which include expanding access and awareness, delivering consumer-focused innovation, growing our global addressable market and driving operational excellence. Today, we are working to expand access to an awareness of Omnipod given the global diabetes market is underpenetrated and growing. We continue to drive increased adoption through the U.S. pharmacy channel, which makes access to Omnipod easier and more affordable by eliminating lengthy lock-in periods and heavy upfront costs. Our pay-as-you-go model removes risk for payers while also providing a superior and affordable experience for our customers. The cost of Omnipod is consistent with multiple daily injections despite Omnipod's form factor, ease of use and improved outcomes. As a result, we continue to capture over 80% of our new customers from multiple daily injections. Nearly all of our global new customers start on Omnipod DASH. And in the U.S. do so primarily through the pharmacy channel. Once we move into full market release this year, we can't wait to offer Omnipod 5 solely through the pharmacy. We also continue to drive increased awareness of Omnipod through our direct-to-consumer advertising campaign as well as our 30-day free trial. Our DTC investment in the U.S. is ramping in support of Omnipod 5. In addition, we continue to invest in DTC in select international markets, which is helping to drive new customer starts and increase awareness of Omnipod. Brand recognition is strong internationally, and these efforts will further raise awareness for Omnipod DASH in advance of our international launch of Omnipod 5. Our Omnipod 5 U.S. limited market release continues to progress as planned. In March, we made the smartphone app available. And we continue to roll out availability on a growing list of Android phone models, including those most widely used in the U.S. The feedback on full smartphone control has been remarkable and highlights how differentiated an experience Omnipod 5 offers. Consistent with what we've heard to date, I will share feedback from one user who has tried multiple forms of insulin delivery for 35 years, including tubed pumps. He said, he has never been in better control. His fears of lows are almost gone. Having diabetes is no longer at the forefront of his thinking and he has confidence in the algorithm to quickly get him to his customized target. He said, he knew Omnipod 5 was going to be good, but he didn't anticipate just how good. All of this feedback validates the years of hard work our teams have put into the development of Omnipod 5 to deliver the best customer experience. With this launch, we have also created a customer service platform centered on simplifying the Omnipod 5 onboarding process and scaling our ability to train users. As an example, today, if you are a current Omnipod and Dexcom user, you have the ability to adopt Omnipod 5 through a 100% digital pathway without having to meet with a clinician or be trained by a field rep. This makes Omnipod easier to access for our customers. While we continue to test the Omnipod 5 customer journeys, our market access team is successfully securing expanded coverage. We are well on our way to achieving our internal target by full market release. After successful completion of the first phase of our limited market release, we recently expanded the availability of Omnipod 5 through a limited distribution network as planned. Now any doctor can write a prescription for Omnipod 5 and a growing number of people will have access to it. We know Omnipod 5 is going to be a game changer for people with diabetes, and we can't wait to bring it to the broader community. Our Omnipod 5 submission for an expanded indication down to age 2 is under active review with the FDA and progressing well, and we continue to plan for updated labeling this year. We also recently shared compelling data from the initial 8-week phase of our type 2 feasibility study. This was the first prospective AID study of people with type 2 diabetes conducted in the U.S. and included participants with an average age of 61 years who used Omnipod 5 at home. Only one individual had experience with an insulin pump and approximately half had never used a CGM. The study results were impressive. The data demonstrated an overall A1c reduction of 1.3%, along with an additional 4.6 hours a day in normal glycemic range. Participants who were previously on MDI experienced reduced time in hypoglycemia and a 32% reduction in total daily dose of insulin. We believe the benefits that users experience during our study are indicative of how powerful Omnipod 5 can be for people with type 2 diabetes, and we remain committed to continuing to innovate to meet the needs of this important group. We also continue to advance our robust product pipeline, including next generations of our Omnipod 5 platform. This includes our iOS development, which is progressing very well, as is our integration work with Dexcom's G7 and Abbott's FreeStyle Libre. While Omnipod 5 is a priority today, we know competing and winning in the underserved global diabetes market requires a firm commitment to innovation. We have a compelling pipeline that includes next-generation AID technology, robust, data-driven and digital innovations and additional technological advancements designed to expand our total addressable markets. Lastly, we continue to build on our strong patent portfolio. We had a record-setting number of patent filings in 2021 and expect to set another record this year. Our current technology as well as our exciting innovation pipeline are well protected and should further strengthen our global leadership in diabetes technology. Diabetes is a growing epidemic with millions of people diagnosed each year, and Omnipod is already making a difference in 23 countries. We are focused on further penetrating our existing markets, expanding our total addressable market by growing our presence in new regions and launching Omnipod 5 internationally. Our CE mark submission is progressing well, and we are making terrific progress preparing for an Omnipod 5 international launch. We are further building our teams and advancing our regulatory reimbursement and market development efforts. AID and CGM awareness and adoption are increasing globally, helping to unlock reimbursement and access pathways. As a result, we will be well positioned to leapfrog the competition and have Omnipod 5 become the preferred AID system in our global markets. In terms of market expansion, last month, we launched Omnipod DASH in Saudi Arabia and expect to enter the United Arab Emirates shortly. Together, these countries increase our total addressable market by approximately 1 million people. And the overall international opportunity represents a significant long-term growth driver. Our global manufacturing capabilities offer another competitive advantage. And we are taking steps to further strengthen our operations. In addition to focusing on supply chain resiliency and ensuring critical component supply, we are also optimizing our international manufacturing footprint. The current macro, inflationary and supply chain environment is challenging. However, our team has been successful in partially offsetting the inflation impact and has also mitigated supply chain risk to ensure uninterrupted supply to our customers. All of their accomplishments should help ensure we have ample component supply and available capacity to meet the demands of our customers, including our full launch of Omnipod 5. Wayde will discuss our manufacturing operations in more detail. In closing, our first quarter results finished ahead of our expectations, and we are off to a great start in 2022. We are making terrific progress in the limited market release of Omnipod 5. And looking ahead, the balance of the year will include a number of important milestones, including the full commercial release of Omnipod 5, an expanded indication down to age 2 and advancement of our innovation pipeline. 2022 is going to be another exciting year for us as well as our customers across the globe. I'll now turn the call over to Wayde. Wayde McMillan : Thanks, Shacey. Before I get into our first quarter performance, I'd like to take a moment to express my own gratitude towards Shacey and also do so on behalf of all of our employees. Her outstanding leadership and invaluable contributions to both the company and people living with diabetes has set up Insulet for a bright future. She embodies our mission. It has been an honor to learn from her and work alongside the group of leaders she has assembled here. We look forward to working with Shacey in her continued role as a Board member and as a company adviser and continuing to benefit from her insights and guidance. At the same time, I'm excited to welcome Jim into his new position. It has been great working with Jim on the Board of Directors to date, and I echo Shacey's confidence in his deep understanding of our business, our culture and our team. And now on to our results. We started the year off well with strong first quarter results, made notable progress in all of our strategic imperatives and are on a path for another successful year. In the first quarter, we generated 19% revenue growth, finishing above the high end of our guidance range. On a reported basis for total revenue, foreign currency was a 220 basis point headwind over Q1 of last year. We delivered U.S. Omnipod revenue growth of 21%, exceeding our guidance range. Revenue growth was driven by the compounding benefit from strong new customer starts as well as increasing volume growth through the U.S. pharmacy channel. Omnipod DASH drove approximately 90% of our U.S. new customer starts and pharmacy channel volume increased to over 55% of our total U.S. volume. International Omnipod revenue grew 12% and was above our guidance range driven by Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by the impact of the pandemic over the past year and AID competition headwinds. On a reported basis, foreign currency was a 640 basis point headwind over prior year. Our estimated global attrition remains stable. Despite a shift in U.S. volume into the pharmacy channel, global pod utilization also remained consistent with historical seasonality as we typically see a sequential decrease in the first quarter of the year driven by the U.S. Drug delivery revenue increased 36%, exceeding our guidance range due to production timing. Gross margin was 71% and above our expectations, representing a 460 basis point increase or 490 basis points on a constant currency basis. The primary drivers were improved manufacturing operations, growing volume through the U.S. pharmacy channel and product mix. These were partially offset by an expected higher mix of costs as we ramp our U.S. manufacturing operations. As a reminder, our current inventory balance includes higher component costs as a result of inflationary headwinds in 2021 that continue in 2022. This will pressure gross margin sequentially each quarter this year as we sell the product out of inventory. I'll provide more color on our expected 2022 gross margin cadence in a few minutes. Operating expenses were in line with our expectations and reflect ongoing investments in innovation, sales and marketing and international expansion. Our focus to further strengthen these critical areas supports our long-term growth trajectory and expansion of our global addressable market. Operating margin was 12.8%, up 630 basis points and adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.3%, up 740 basis points. Both were above our expectations due to higher-than-anticipated revenue and gross margin improvement and to a lesser extent, timing. Turning to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with over $700 million in cash and the full $60 million available under our revolving credit facility. Our financial position remains strong and provides opportunities to continue to invest across our business. We've taken steps to further strengthen our global manufacturing scale and flexibility, including consolidating our production in China into our newer lower cost facility. We also expect to invest in a new manufacturing facility in Malaysia. These actions are intended to support our international expansion strategy, further ensure product supply and drive margin improvement over time. Now turning to 2022 guidance. We are maintaining our full year revenue range of 12% to 16% and raising the low end for total Omnipod by 100 basis points to 16% to 20%. For U.S. Omnipod, we are raising the low end by 100 basis points to 19% to 23%. Our growth within the type 1 and type 2 markets will be driven primarily by Omnipod DASH volume growth and our unique pay-as-you-go model and pharmacy channel access. The Omnipod 5 launch and adoption ramp will take time given we are in limited market release for part of 2022 and due to our annuity-based business model. For international Omnipod, we are maintaining our full year revenue guidance of 9% to 14%, driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by pandemic impacts and AID competition headwinds. As a reminder, we expect international revenue growth will be higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half due to a slightly easier comparison as well as an anticipated improvement in COVID conditions. Lastly, we continue to expect drug delivery revenue to decline 30% to 35% as 2021 levels were elevated as a result of the pandemic. Turning to 2022 gross margin. Despite increasing inflationary and supply chain pressure, we continue to expect to achieve 67% to 68%. The drivers of the decline from last year remain the same : product mix, including ramping Omnipod 5 volume; higher costs associated with our U.S. manufacturing ramp; and higher component and manufacturing costs associated with inflation. All partially offset by the benefits of our strengthened global manufacturing operations and capabilities and increasing volume in the U.S. pharmacy channel. We expect gross margin to decline sequentially throughout the year due to the various factors discussed as well as higher component costs included in inventory. We were happy to exceed 70% gross margin this quarter. And after working through inflationary impacts for the next couple of years, we still have plans to achieve 70% on a sustained basis over time. We continue to expect operating expenses to rise sequentially in 2022 as we increase investments. Key areas of investments include our expanding innovation pipeline, direct-to-consumer advertising, clinical efforts and the launch of Omnipod 5. As a result of the higher macro and inflationary supply chain and foreign exchange pressures, we now expect operating margin to be flat year-over-year. Despite these headwinds, we are still focused on expanding operating margin over time. For Q2, given both the expected sequential decline in gross margin and the increasing sequential investment to support the Omnipod 5 launch and other initiatives, we expect a sequential decline in operating margin. Lastly, we continue to expect capital expenditures will grow slightly this year as we continue to invest in key areas of our business. Turning to our second quarter 2022 revenue guidance. We expect total company growth of 12% to 15%, including total Omnipod growth of 17% to 20%. Based on current foreign exchange rates, we estimate the unfavorable impact will be approximately 400 basis points on a reported basis. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect to continue to build momentum with growth of 21% to 24%, driven by the benefits of our recurring revenue model and growing Omnipod DASH volume through the U.S. pharmacy channel. As a reminder and as planned, Omnipod 5 is still in limited market release and will not contribute materially to revenue growth in Q2. We expect Q2 international Omnipod growth of 9% to 12%, driven by continued Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by the compounding impact from lower new customer starts in 2021, largely due to the pandemic and competitive AID headwinds. We estimate the unfavorable foreign exchange impact will be approximately 1,100 basis points on a reported basis. Finally, we expect Q2 drug delivery revenue to decline 43% to 37% year-over-year, which is also a significant sequential decline as revenue is normalizing to pre-pandemic trends. There will be choppiness in the remaining quarterly revenue based on our partners requested order patterns and timing of production. In conclusion, we've begun 2022 much like we ended 2021, strong execution against our strategic imperatives that position Insulet well for long-term sustainable growth. While our mission has not changed, our ability to deliver on it only gets stronger. We've never been in a better position to improve the lives of people with diabetes. With that, Dalam, please open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : Congratulations on a nice quarter. And Shacey, congratulations on all the success you've had at Insulet. I know you'll be missed. I'd love to start with a question for Jim. I heard he's on the line. Is that okay? Could you hear me okay? Operator? Operator : Yes. One moment, sir. Shacey Petrovic : Dalam, are you on the line? Operator : Yes. I am on the line. Shacey Petrovic : Okay. We've dialed back in. So you've got the Insulet team back here, Shacey, Wayde, Bret and Deb. Operator : Okay. All right. So go ahead Mr. Biegelsen, could you please repeat your question. Larry Biegelsen : Sure. Well, first, Shacey, congratulations on the nice quarter here, and congratulations on the success you've had at Insulet. I know you'll be missed. I heard that Jim was on. Shacey, is it okay to ask Jim a question? Shacey Petrovic : Sure. Larry Biegelsen : Sure, if Jim is on. So Jim, I think maybe this is the first time many of us are hearing from you, certainly in this role. So Jim, you've been on the Board of Insulet since 2019, so you know the company well. So I'd love to hear what your goals are over the next year? And how are you thinking about Insulet more broadly? Do you see opportunities outside of diabetes? Congratulations on your new role. Jim Hollingshead : Thank you, Larry. I really appreciate the question. Look, I have been on the Insulet Board now for 3 years. And the first thing I would say is, it's such an honor to be entrusted with leadership for our next chapter of growth by Shacey and by the whole Board. I think Shacey's leadership has just been remarkable. It's one of the main reasons I was drawn to join the Board and was so privileged to join the Board. And Shacey has accomplished so many things in her tenure here, 7-year tenure here and 3 years as CEO, we wouldn't have time to list them all. But I will say one of the main things that Shacey has accomplished is she's built this incredible executive team here at Insulet. And so when I think about stepping in, I think we're not going to miss a beat. I think the key thing is that we continue to grow. We continue to succeed with innovation. We're driving opportunities to change the lives of people with diabetes. We're in the middle of a fantastic product launch with a revolutionary product. And couple that with the fact that Shacey is going to stay on the Board, which is, I'm just really excited. She's going to continue to advise us in a formal capacity. I think the key thing is we're just charging straight ahead, and we're not going to miss a beat. Operator : I show our next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Robbie Marcus : Great. Congrats on a nice quarter. And I'll also add, Shacey, we'll miss you, wish you the best. And Jim, welcome, looking forward to working with you. I wanted to ask on new patients here. Maybe you could walk us through what happened in first quarter in terms of new patient adds. Some of your peers faced some difficult times in January, February. Maybe if you could comment on U.S. new patient growth and international new patient growth and what it was for the quarter and how it trended. We're looking and focused more on the exit rate. And I just wanted to clarify the comments you made. Is a full launch still possible in the second quarter? I just wanted to clarify it based on the comments you made. Shacey Petrovic : Sure. Yes. Thanks, Robbie. Maybe I'll just reiterate at a high level, Q1 was a record quarter for us, both globally and in the U.S. It was a record Q1. So a really strong start to the year. Bret, do you want to add some detail there? Bret Christensen : Just, Robbie, we're selling our strength, still the only tubeless form factor in the market, the simplicity of Omnipod. And then we do believe, again, that the message that the fastest pathway to Omnipod 5 is to get DASH, and that seems to be resonating, and we believe there's a little bit of a lift there as well. But all in all, this is another record quarter for new starts, and we're happy with the performance in the U.S. and around the globe. Shacey Petrovic : And to your second question regarding Omnipod 5 and the full market release, we were excited to expand our limited market release. I think Bret and the team did a really smart thing there expanding through specialty and mail-order pharmacies, which is about where 20% of our business goes through today. About 80% of it goes through retail, and we're not yet in retail. But I would just caution anybody from thinking about it as a flip of the switch. So we're going to continue to ramp here towards full market release. And right now, we're going from sort of hundreds of patients to thousands of patients. So of course, I guess, June is still possible, but we have to give ourselves the room to take any learnings that might occur from this move from hundreds of patients to thousands of patients and make sure that we react to those, incorporate those learnings and that we are fully prepared for a full market release and entering into the retail channel when we get there. So hopefully, that gives you good guidance. Operator : I show our next question comes from the line of Travis Steed from Bank of America Securities. Travis Steed : Congrats, Shacey, on all the things you've done at Insulet, going to miss working with you as well, and look forward to working with you, too, Jim. So on the Omnipod 5 rollout, I guess, just give a little more color on some of the initial feedback you've gotten from some of the initial users. And I'm trying to understand the cadence here of the launch, like what's the next step? Are you going to go to the retail channel all at once or step by step? And just a better understanding about kind of the rate limiting factor on the rollout would be great. Bret Christensen : Travis, it's Bret. I can give a little bit more color on the limited market release to full market release. So it's probably helpful to start with the end and how we are defining the full market release. And we do define a full market release as being in the retail channel, which Shacey said is where 80% of our pharmacy business is today. So this next phase is with a limited distribution network and that just means mostly mail-order and a smaller number of distributors. But it does mean that any physician can write a prescription and any patient that has access and reimbursement can get our product. They just have to go through a channel that maybe they're not currently going through in the pharmacy channel. So it won't be a flip of the switch, as Shacey said. We'll continue to progress in that way. What's exciting, I guess, about this next phase is that it does test our scale. So we started with hundreds, a predetermined number of patients in the LMR. Now we're going to start driving prescriptions, scaling the release. And it will continue to scale until we get to the full market release. We'll continue to learn. And a lot of what we're learning today is around the pathway that patients take to get on product. If you remember, we talked about the limited market release in probably hundreds of different pathways, depending on what a user's current experience is with CGM, with MDI, tubed pumps, et cetera, that they could take a unique training pathway for each of them. So some of the things we're learning in LMR is just how to tweak that experience a little bit to maybe set better expectations with some of those patients so that when they start, they know exactly what to expect with Omnipod 5. And we'll continue to learn, but we're right on track to what we said we would do, which is sometime between 3 and 9 months. We're 3 months in now. And we're excited about this next phase. But the next phase really is after this one really is full market release, and we'll just progress until we get there, which is a retail launch. Operator : I show our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Baird. Jeff Johnson : And Shacey, nothing but the best. I just want you to know how much I've appreciated holding you up as such a great example of professional success for my 17-year-old daughter. And let me just ask a question outside the U.S. I know a lot of questions on the U.S. O5 launch. But outside the U.S., have you had any conversations with EU regulatory authorities at this point? Just maybe any updated thoughts on time line to CE mark and how soon you could maybe flip over to commercialization once you do get CE mark? Shacey Petrovic : Sure. Thanks, Jeff. I'll maybe just give you an update on the submission and then Bret can talk a little bit about the market development and market preparation for launch that's underway. So we've had a lot of back and forth with our notified body. And we believe that the submission is progressing very well, no red flags. And we were really well prepared because we had such a comprehensive FDA submission and also because our data was so strong. So we do feel like we're in a really strong position. The only challenge in terms of giving you guidelines or guidance for timing is just that the MDR pathway is just a relatively new pathway, both to us and our notified body. So that's the challenge, but we are making great progress and feel very confident about that happening. It's just hard to give you some particular timing on that. And then there's been a ton of work underway preparing for market launch. So Bret, if you want to provide some color on that? Bret Christensen : Sure. Jeff, we're doing a lot of work now to prepare for the launch of Omnipod 5 outside the U.S. And contrasting it to our DASH launch, if you remember when we got approval for DASH, it was pretty quickly that we rolled out to all of our markets internationally and very quickly got to almost 100% of all new starts on DASH. The difference with Omnipod 5 is probably twofold. One, there's infrastructure with the cloud that's going to be unique by country depending on data privacy and different requirements. The other thing is reimbursement. So the reimbursement pathway for each country is different frankly because this is a new category of product where DASH was simply the same category as our legacy product. So there's different reimbursement pathways, different infrastructure to consider. And so you'll probably see more of a staged launch by country outside the U.S. once we do get clearance. Operator : I show the next question comes from the line of Steve Lichtman from Oppenheimer. Steve Lichtman : Shacey, all the best to you. And good luck, Jim, in your new role. I wanted to also ask on financial, excuse me, on international, saw some nice upside there in 1Q. I guess, one, are you seeing some of the Omnipod 5 excitement starting to build, giving greater visibility that it's coming with the CE mark filing and U.S. approval, so seeing some pull forward as Bret mentioned earlier with U.S. And it would seem that based on the second quarter guidance coming off of this better 1Q that you could be trending towards the high end of your full year range. So overall, how are you feeling about that international business even ahead of Omnipod 5? Bret Christensen : Yes. Steven, I can comment probably on the first part and pass it over to Wayde for any color on guidance. But yes, we're really pleased with how the international markets are performing. Of course, there's a ton of optimism and excitement for Omnipod 5. And it's why we are excited to be under CE mark review, and we're working ambitiously to get it to market. Just like the U.S., we know it will make a difference in new starts, in demand and that there's this desire to have the best form factor paired with an AID system. So of course, there's tons of interest outside the U.S. We're trying to manage that with our current base and expectations with our partners over there, but that's why the work is so important that we get it to market, and we're excited about the CE mark. And again, we'll plan accordingly, but we'll phase the launch depending on the readiness of each market, considering the size and opportunity. And we're so excited to get there. And maybe, Wayde, you can talk a little bit about what that means. Wayde McMillan : Yes. Sounds good. As Bret said, we're doing very well competing with the form factor. And so we've been in this low teens, low double digits range now for a little over a year. And it's good double-digit growth, but we know we could be growing faster if we had our AID system as we've talked about. We just don't participate in that part of the market today. And so that's what's reflected in our Q2 guide as well as you mentioned, Steve, for the full year. And just a reminder, the second half of the year guide is a little stronger because we have a slightly easing comp especially in Q4. And then the impact of the pandemic over the last 4 quarters, just to remind everybody with our annuity model, impacts us. And so even though the pandemic is easing, we're still annualizing those quarters from last year. And so as we do that throughout the year, you'll see our growth rates start to strengthen in the second half. Operator : I show the next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy from SVB Securities. Danielle Antalffy : And Shacey, I can't even tell you how bummed I am to hear that you are leaving and you will definitely be missed. You've been a girl crush of mine for a long time. So don't worry, you'll stay my girl crush. So just a question on primary care physician. We've been doing a lot of work on the diabetes space, and it feels like there's still so much learning to be had on the primary care side of things for pumps and CGMs, which is actually the crux of a lot of the work we've been doing. I'm just curious about how you guys at Insulet are going after the primary care doctor and how it's different versus the endo? And how you think the mix, the prescriber mix will evolve over time? So yes, I'll leave it at that. Shacey Petrovic : Thanks, Danielle. I'm not going anywhere. I do plan to do everything in my power as an adviser and a Board member to continue to support Insulet's success. And I know it's in great hands with Jim and his outstanding team. Maybe, Bret, do you want to comment on the primary care part? Bret Christensen : Yes. Danielle, we spent a lot of time thinking about primary care because as we desire to penetrate the type 2 market, in particular, more vigorously that many of them do reside with primary care. So today, we're getting leads in primary care mainly through our DTC campaigns. We get a lot of patients to see their physician. And so we're sort of reactive for the most part with primary care because we're waiting for a patient to become a lead and then we're reaching out to that particular primary care doc and getting them started on Omnipod DASH. But we also do call on a very small number of primary care physicians, but mainly those that sort of operate like an endocrinologist and write a lot of insulin prescriptions, for instance. We get good information from IQVIA. We know who they are. But we do want to expand more into that segment. I think a couple of things are the challenge with primary care that we have to solve for. One is just their willingness to tackle complexity. And they see pump therapy, in general, has been more complex than something they typically do today. So we have to solve for that. Virtual training is the way we can do that. The simpler we make the product, the easier it is to onboard the pharmacy channel, low co-pays. All those things we're doing will help, for sure. The other thing is just breadth. There's over 200,000 primary care physicians in the U.S. We obviously will have a sales force to tackle that. So we'll look to penetrate primary care in the future through more direct-to-consumer, more digital marketing and then ultimately better solutions and products that more succinctly fit the type 2 segment. But there's a lot of work to do there. Most of the success we're having with type 2 today is within the endocrinology segment, but we know the opportunity is massive and we do get a lot of leads from direct-to-consumer. Operator : I show the next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from Citi. Joanne Wuensch : And may I also say thank you and good luck. And I don't know, anything more than that, I might start crying. So 2 quick questions. What percentage of your new patients were type 2? And the second question has to do with your new patients that are coming on and you expect to see using Omnipod 5. Are those transfer students from your current platform or do you see it pulling more patients from MDI and/or tubed pumps? Shacey Petrovic : Joanne, yes, in my prepared remarks, I mentioned 35% approximately of our new users were type 2. So it's great to see continued really strong growth, particularly in a record Q1. And as it relates to Omnipod 5, we've been pretty limited there. So it's a very small sample at this point relative to our total base. So we said hundreds of patients and they're coming from all segments because we wanted to test every customer journey that we can. So we're in still process of testing all those customer journeys, so we've got people coming on from MDI, from existing Omnipod users and also from tubed pumps and AID pumps and managing to get really good insights across each of those customer journeys. As we look ahead, we've talked about the fact that today, we get 80% of our new users from multiple daily injections. And it will be really interesting to see what happens with that segment. I think we believe that Omnipod 5 has the power to continue to grow the overall market and bring great better outcomes, better quality of life to people who are relying on multiple daily injections. But we also know that this is a more competitive offering for those people who were choosing AID over form factor and now they can have both. So we're pretty excited to see what that means for our percentages and our ratios and whether or not we have transfer students or new students as we look forward. Operator : I show the next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien from Piper Sandler. Matthew O\u2019Brien: And Shacey, I hope everything is okay, manageable and best of luck to you going forward. Just to follow up a little bit on Joanne's question, the comment about maybe I think Bret mentioned a little bit of a push on the DASH side this quarter. And then I think you said type 2s are 35% this quarter. And I don't want to make too big a deal with this, but 35% to 40% is what you said last quarter. So what I'm really getting at is, are you seeing more type 1 patients coming on, getting access through DASH to get access to Omnipod 5? Shacey Petrovic : Sure. Great question. And I think we likely are. And that was Bret's point that, in fact, the fastest way to get on to Omnipod 5, which we know today is indicated for the type 1 user is through Omnipod DASH. So we do believe that part of that is what's driving our record new customer starts and also probably driving a slight shift in percentages there. But I don't want to dismiss the fact that 35% of our new users are type 2. The product Omnipod DASH is still doing tremendous things for that segment, bringing better outcomes and still obviously an incredibly appealing product that's driving great growth there. Operator : I show the next question comes from the line of Jayson Bedford. Jayson Bedford : And Shacey, I wish you the best. I hope everything works out. Just so I understand the current phase of the limited market release and it was kind of touched on before, but any physician can write a script, but the user has to access the technology in the specialty channel, kind of the non-retail pharmacy channel. I'm just wondering, is this due to capacity on your part? Is it more of a reflection of your discussion with payers? Just wondering what you need to see before you broaden the launch. Bret Christensen : Jayson, it's Bret. I can give a little bit of color around that. So yes, any physician can write a prescription. You're right. And any patient that has access to the product, they just can't, for instance, pick up a prescription and walk down the street to their Walgreens or CVS and expect to get Omnipod at that retail location for now. There's a couple of reasons why we would do this and use this limited distributor network for the LMR and the expanded phase of the LMR. One, as you know, we just get better visibility to who's starting. Once you start to ship product to the retail channel, it's out there. And so we don't have as much visibility and that doesn't help us with our goal of really monitoring people that are coming on, monitoring their experience and having the ability to quickly reach out to them if necessary. So this keeps us closer to the patient. It keeps us closer to the process. We get more feedback on their onboarding pathway. And it just gets us more comfortable with finally shipping product to the retail channel, which is, again, how we'll define full market release. So it's a good step. We think it does broadly open up access. But at the same time, helps us meet our goals of measuring and monitoring as we expand to the retail launch. Operator : I show our next question comes from the line of Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Brandon Vazquez : This is Brandon on for Margaret. I'd like to just echo the sentiment from the rest of the sell-side community and thanking Shacey for all her work, and congrats on building a great organization here. I wanted to focus my question on the type 2 pathway as well. We obviously saw really encouraging data with Omnipod 5 at ATTD. So that was both in MDI and basal. What are the next steps here for you to kind of keep moving forward, getting an Omnipod 5 type 2 label? Do you need to make any software or hardware changes? Do you need an additional trial to kind of understand the market or can you kind of just roll into a pivotal? So any color you can give around there just to understand at least the pathway if we can't get a time line on that. Shacey Petrovic : Sure. Thanks, Brandon. Yes, the data was really strong. It was really great to see. Our feasibility study included type 2 users that were at a pretty low baseline of control. So I mentioned many who had not used the CGM and only one who had used a pump. So really representative of that broad type 2 population out there. Baselines were at 32% time in range for basal-only and 46% time in range for MDI. And depending on that cohort, we saw a 30% to 50% increase in time in range, so quite extraordinary performance there. So I think overall, we feel like we're in a, the feasibility data accomplished what it did or what we set out to do, which is demonstrate that this technology has probably enormous value in the type 2 population. So this supports our discussions. This data supports our discussions with the FDA to determine the right size and design for our pivotal study. This is really the, probably the wrap-up of our feasibility study and then we will move into a pivotal. We believe that pivotal study is likely to look very similar based on our early discussions, very similar to the type 1 pivotal, so hundreds of patients over 3 months looking at similar endpoints. But we need to finalize those discussions. We're in discussions with the FDA on a number of fronts regarding type 2 diabetes. And once we finalize that design and then start recruiting for the pivotal, you guys will be the first to know. And I guess I'd just emphasize that in the meantime, we have this great product with DASH that's making a difference for people with type 2. That will continue to drive value for us. And it also continues to help us learn more and more about the clinician population and the patient population that we're serving with type 2. Operator : I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Shacey Petrovic. Shacey Petrovic : Thanks, Dalam. So I think you all know that it has been the honor of my career to lead the remarkable team at Insulet. And I know the company is in great hands with Jim leading the organization into its next chapter. As you heard today, Insulet is delivering terrific results and is poised for even greater growth and value creation for our shareholders and people with diabetes across the globe as we progress toward the full U.S. commercial launch of Omnipod 5. I am really excited to continue supporting and contributing to our success as a director and adviser. Insulet is just getting started, and our future is very bright. Thanks for your support, your comments today and taking the time to join the call. Have a great afternoon. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct the question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President of Investor Relations. Deborah Gordon : Thank you, Dilem. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Insulet\u2019s second quarter 2022 earnings call. With me today are; Jim Hollingshead, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Wayde McMillan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Bret Christensen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, is also with us today for the Q&A portion of our call. Both the replay of this call and the press release discussing our 2022 second quarter results and 2022 guidance will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking, and could materially differ from current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such statements. We\u2019ll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely adjusted operating margin, adjusted EBITDA and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. These measures align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance, and we believe they are helpful to investors, analysts and other interested parties as measures of our operating performance from period to period. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis with the exception of revenue growth rate, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim. Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. I\u2019m excited to be here with you today on my first earnings call as CEO of Insulet. This past quarter, we exceeded our revenue expectations resulting from sustained momentum across our business. We are halfway through the year and the entire Insulet team is executing at a high level. We increased our full year outlook for US Omnipod, delivered record US and global new customer starts, had our second highest new customer starts quarter internationally and meaningfully advanced each of our strategic imperatives. Accomplishing this was no easy task, given the challenging global macro environment that we and other companies are facing. We are incredibly excited to have recently entered full market release for Omnipod 5. And now our differentiated transformative technology is available broadly through retail pharmacies. The results to-date have been amazing. Omnipod 5 is proving to be the game changer we thought it would be. Customer and healthcare provider feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, and our teams are doing a remarkable job executing the launch. Our CE Mark submission review is progressing very well, and we are in the final stretch toward approval. This represents a key milestone in our plan to bring Omnipod 5 to people with diabetes around the world. This approval is one step in our strategy to participate in the international AID market, which is being driven largely by CGM reimbursement. We have also advanced our clinical efforts. Our FDA submission for an expanded indication for Omnipod 5 in the US down to age two is progressing very well, and we are confident in the near-term clearance. The value that Omnipod 5 can deliver to young children and their families is abundantly clear, and we\u2019re thrilled to soon bring Omnipod 5 to this highly vulnerable population. We shared compelling data at ADA, demonstrating how powerful Omnipod 5 can be for the Type 2 insulin requirement population, a market segment that is further adopting Omnipod due to our unique value proposition. And in the Type 1 population, we are currently enrolling for a 200-patient 3-months randomized controlled trial in France and the US to demonstrate superior efficacy for Omnipod 5 compared to non-AID pumps and CGM alone. Lastly, we broke ground at our future Malaysian manufacturing facility, which will strengthen our global manufacturing capabilities and redundancy, as well as support our international expansion strategy. Before moving into a broader view of the quarter on our progress, I want to take a step back and reflect on my first two months as CEO. I was aware of the strength and commitment of the entire Insulet team from my three years on the Board of Directors. Now that I\u2019m CEO, I\u2019m even more impressed. Our global teams are exceptional. The shared commitment to our mission of improving the lives of people with diabetes is inspiring and is pervasive throughout our organization. Diabetes is a growing global epidemic and Insulet\u2019s ability to serve unmet needs and provide improved outcomes has never been more important. It is clear that we have the team, the product portfolio, the innovation roadmap, and most importantly, the passion to improve millions of lives, and I\u2019m excited and privileged to lead Insulet on that journey. Expanding access and awareness are keys to driving our business forward. Despite improvements over the last few years, only a small percentage of people with Type 1 diabetes globally benefit from insulin delivery technology. Access and awareness are important levers that will significantly drive increased penetration over the coming years. We are making terrific progress building awareness and securing coverage globally, including broad coverage for Omnipod 5 in the US. We\u2019ve built a unique leadership position in the US pharmacy channel, which improves functional access for both the Type 1 and Type 2 populations. The vast majority of our US customers continue to pay less than $50 each month through the pharmacy for Omnipod DASH and now Omnipod 5, with many paid nothing. We\u2019ve eliminated lengthy lock-in periods and upfront costs that are common in the DME channel, and our pay-as-you-go model provides easier and more affordable access for our customers and removes risk for payers. And we are delivering this easier access, combined with lower costs, while also delivering an improved customer experience and better outcomes. That\u2019s a winning combination and one that resonates with people using multiple daily injections, a population from which we continue to capture approximately 80% of our new customers. Our pharmacy channel and pay-as-you-go business models also connect with people with Type 2 diabetes. We are acutely focused on making access simple and more affordable, providing an unmatched form factor and generating clinical evidence that supports what Omnipod can do for the Type 2 population. Because the Omnipod offering is so compelling, during the second quarter, Type 2 users represented almost 30% of our US new customer starts. As expected, this is a percentage reduction from prior quarters, because Omnipod 5 is indicated for use with people with Type 1 diabetes, as is the case with all AID systems. Therefore, we expect the mix percentage of new customers to change as more people with Type 1 adopt Omnipod 5. We saw this begin in Q2 and we\u2019re excited to see it continue now that we are in full market release. Nevertheless, we continue to see a strong number of new customers with Type 2 adopting Omnipod DASH, and we remain confident in our ability to further penetrate this underserved population. A major component of our awareness efforts is our direct-to-consumer advertising campaign. We ramped our DTC program ahead of the full market release of Omnipod 5 and have since accelerated our spend. This has resulted in more people wanting to learn about Omnipod 5 and the impact it can have on their lives and those they care about. We expect our DTC efforts for Omnipod 5 will be even more effective than what we have experienced for Omnipod DASH. We are also using DTC to drive awareness for Omnipod in select international markets. Customers love Omnipod 5. That\u2019s because of the number of firsts it brings to the market. It\u2019s the first pod-based AID system, the first fully compatible phone controlled AID system, the first system no one has to plug in to access data and the first with a smart bolus calculator to directly incorporate trends. We\u2019ve heard humbling and inspiring stories from countless customers and we\u2019re just getting started. I want to share a couple of stories we\u2019ve heard from individuals adopting Omnipod 5 and how impactful it\u2019s been for their lives. An individual who had been using an insulin pump for over a decade and recently switched to Omnipod 5, told us that after 10 years of worrying about visible tubes, getting caught on door knobs and dealing with the nuisances of being tethered to his pump. He now spends more time focusing on life. His outcomes have improved, including his overnight blood sugar, and he no longer has to live his life with diabetes top of mind. We also heard from a physician who has lived with Type 1 diabetes for 43 years. He noted that during that time, he\u2019s seen treatment options evolve and change, but Omnipod 5 is the largest leap in improvement he has ever seen. This very experienced physician called our system \"remarkable\". These two stories are just a small representation of the amazing testimonials we continue to receive from Omnipod 5 users. There\u2019s a common thread that connects all the stories we hear from users. Omnipod 5 is redefining how people manage their disease and it\u2019s making their lives simpler. The impact Omnipod 5 is having is clear and it\u2019s powerful. In Q2, the first full quarter of limited market release, Omnipod 5 already represented over 25% of our US new customer starts. We expect that percentage to accelerate with the US full market release as we now sell through a broader distribution channel, including all of our wholesalers that supply products to approximately 88,000 retail pharmacies. We are also having outstanding success securing coverage for Omnipod 5. Today, we have over 55% covered lives for Omnipod 5, which is well ahead of where we were when launching Omnipod DASH, and represents a significant increase from Q1. Our team has done an amazing job, and we expect to make meaningful progress the rest of this year and into the next. Omnipod 5 is now fully available through retail, specialty and mail order pharmacies to anyone with a prescription and coverage in line with our expected timing. Our limited market release provided key learnings about how healthcare professionals and customers interact with our product on board and virtually trained, all of which are dramatically easier than ever before. Already, the small improvements we have implemented are resonating with users, especially those coming from a tubed pump who transition to a more simplified experience. In fact, one of the key learnings is that, physicians and patients can rely on the automation of the system to do the work for them during the first few days. Omnipod 5 works with the first pod out of the box and then it learns and adapts to personalized care for each individual user, typically within the first or second pod change. This ability to automatically personalize therapy clearly differentiates Omnipod 5 from all other systems on the market. Quite simply, Omnipod 5 eliminates significant burden and shared work between patients and their physicians. Although our target market continues to be MDI, not surprisingly, many of our Omnipod 5 new customers come from competitive pumps and people are loving the experience. The clinical benefits from Omnipod 5 were clearly demonstrated by the Preschool Pivotal Extension Data we shared at ADA that built on the strong results we saw during the study\u2019s initial phase, which were recently published in the peer-reviewed journal, Diabetes Care. During the first three-month phase of the study as well as through the end of the extension phase, patients achieved an average A1c of 6.9% compared to 7.4% at baseline. The data clearly demonstrated these individuals maintained their improved levels through the extension phase. Time in range and percent time in hypoglycemia also showed sustained improvements during the extension phase, demonstrating the durability and power of Omnipod 5 for this critical population. We look forward to receiving our preschool indication for Omnipod 5 this year. The engagement around Omnipod 5 at ADA was really something to see. We met with hundreds of attendees at our booth and held a product theater that was standing room only. It was here where we shared patient case studies and the real-world experience of HCPs who have had remarkable success with Omnipod 5. The overwhelming feedback was that Omnipod 5 clearly stood out as the most robust AID offering. And many of the MDI and tubed pump users in attendance have since adopted our technology. Overall, ADA marked another opportunity to highlight our products and clinical accomplishments that demonstrate how Omnipod can change the lives of people with diabetes around the globe and how important and meaningful our mission is. We are also advancing our innovation pipeline. We\u2019re developing the next generations of Omnipod 5, furthering our iOS development and working closely with our CGM partners, Dexcom and Abbott. Our innovation priorities are focused on growing our addressable market, building our next-generation AID technology, and creating digital and data-driven products to make diabetes management easier for our customers and their physicians. Moving on to our international operations. Our Omnipod 5 CE Mark submission is moving swiftly through review, and we expect approval over the next couple of months. This is an important milestone for our international business as we work to bring Omnipod 5 to people around the world. CE Mark clears the way for us to focus on completing a cloud-based infrastructure that is compatible with local data protection regulations, developing country-specific launch plans, channel and customer experience approaches and seeking reimbursement. Omnipod 5 is a transformative platform, and we look forward to entering our first international markets in mid-2023. We will take a staged approach to entering markets so we can ensure successful launches in each country in which we operate. In addition to bringing Omnipod 5 to global markets, we continue working to enter new markets and recently launched Omnipod DASH in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Omnipod is now available in 24 countries, and we\u2019re building local teams and advancing our regulatory and reimbursement goals. These efforts will serve us well as we bring Omnipod 5 to our international markets and strengthen our competitive position. Lastly, the global supply chain and inflation, each presents significant challenges to Insulet as they do for most manufacturers across a range of industries. However, we continue to navigate these headwinds and increase our resiliency, ensuring ample product supply, including supporting the Omnipod 5 launch and the needs of our growing global customer base. We are mitigating supply risks by securing components well ahead of our capacity needs. While this comes at an increased cost that will have a near-term impact on margins, we are taking the appropriate steps in these turbulent times to ensure uninterrupted supply for our current and future customers. The footprint of our global manufacturing operations is one of our many competitive advantages, and we advanced our efforts to further strengthen our capabilities. We recently broke ground at a new manufacturing location in Malaysia, the future facility located in Johor Bahru represents an investment of approximately $200 million over the next five years, will provide approximately 400,000 square feet of manufacturing space and house more than 500 full-time employees at capacity. Our regional sourcing strategy includes the use of local suppliers for components and we have already outlined our plans to utilize environmentally responsible and resource-efficient materials in our building design. We expect to begin production at this new facility by the end of 2024. This facility supports our operational strategy to increase our global manufacturing redundancy, build our global talent base and support future international market expansion efforts. In closing, the second quarter marked a number of financial, commercial and operational milestones. Our entire Insulet team continues to execute with an unwavering commitment to our mission and to our customers. We are proud of all the work and accomplishments we achieved this quarter, and now we are setting the stage for sustainable long-term growth. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Wayde. Wayde McMillan : Thanks, Jim. We\u2019ve made great progress in Q2 as we delivered another quarter of record US and global new customer starts and achieved a number of notable milestones, including the US full commercial launch of Omnipod 5 within the time range we expected. We are advancing each of our strategic imperatives, navigating supply chain and inflation challenges and maintaining our focus on fulfilling our mission. We generated 18% revenue growth in the second quarter, finishing above the high end of our guidance range. On a reported basis, for total revenue, foreign currency was a 390 basis point headwind compared to Q2 of last year. US Omnipod revenue growth was 31%, exceeding our guidance range. Revenue growth continues to be driven by the compounding benefit from record new customer starts and increasing volume through the US pharmacy channel, including initial contributions from Omnipod 5. Q2 revenue included an estimated $7 million of net channel inventory build, which consisted of Omnipod 5 inventory build, partially offset by a reduction of classic Omnipod and Omnipod DASH inventory at our distributors. Additionally, as a reminder, Q2 of the prior year included a favorable comparison for an approximate $2 million catch-up in rebates from earlier periods. Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH new customer starts combined, were up sequentially to over 90% of our total US new customer starts, comprised of Omnipod DASH at approximately 65% and Omnipod 5, over 25%. In addition, pharmacy channel volume increased to approximately 65% of our total US volume. International Omnipod revenue increased 9% at the low end of our guidance range, driven by Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by AID competition headwinds and the pandemic\u2019s compounding impact over the past year. On a reported basis, foreign currency was a 1,130 basis point headwind over prior year. During Q2, both our estimated global attrition and pod utilization remain consistent. Drug Delivery revenue declined 36%, in line with our guidance range. Gross margin was 63.6%, representing a 580 basis point decrease or 640 basis points on a constant currency basis. The primary drivers were the expected higher mix of costs and manufacturing inefficiencies as we ramp our US manufacturing operations, a higher warranty accrual for costs related to Omnipod DASH PDMs for battery lives as they age, as well as higher costs given the mix impact of Omnipod 5 ramping, all partially offset by growing volume through the US pharmacy channel. As a reminder, the higher mix of volume at our US manufacturing facility, growing Omnipod 5 volume and the higher component costs included in our inventory balance will continue to pressure gross margin for the remainder of this year as we sell the product out of inventory. Operating expenses were above our expectations due to $27.3 million of legal costs as well as $3.4 million of costs associated with the Retirement and Advisory Services of the former CEO. Excluding these charges, operating expenses were higher than Q2 of last year, due to continued investments in sales and marketing, such as our Omnipod 5 launch efforts, international expansion, continued investments in innovation and scaling our global business to support our growth. Adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA in Q2, which exclude the legal and CEO transition costs, were 1.3% and 9.2%, respectively. Both were impacted by the gross margin pressures and increase in operating expenses and unfavorable foreign currency. Turning to cash and liquidity. During the quarter, we secured an additional $10 million of availability under our revolving credit facility. We ended the quarter with over $700 million in cash and the full $70 million available under our credit facility. Overall, our financial position is strong and provides flexibility to invest across our business to fuel sustainable long-term growth. Now, turning to 2022 guidance. We are raising full year revenue to a range of 14% to 17%. For US Omnipod, we are increasing our revenue range to 23% to 26%. Revenue growth will be driven primarily by increased Omnipod DASH volume through the pharmacy channel, the benefit of our pay-as-you-go model, which should expand both our Type 1 and Type 2 customer base, and increasing volume for Omnipod 5, following our full market release. As a reminder, significant revenue from the Omnipod 5 launch and adoption ramp will take time given our annuity-based business model. For international Omnipod, we are reducing our full year revenue guidance to 9% to 12%, related to the impact of AID competition in our international markets. Revenue growth will be driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption, which is sold in all of our markets. We expect international revenue growth will be the highest in the fourth quarter of the year \u2013 due to an easier comparison as well as an expected improvement in COVID conditions. Lastly, for our drug delivery revenue range, we are lowering full year guidance to a decline of 35% to 40%. As a reminder, 2021 levels were elevated as a result of the pandemic. Turning to 2022 gross margin. We now expect a range of 65% to 66%, representing a decline of 200 basis points from our previous expectation as we continue to encounter higher costs associated with ramping US manufacturing and Omnipod 5 volumes, higher warranty costs, and the ongoing inflationary and supply chain pressures in the broader macro environment. We continue to execute strategies to partially offset these headwinds, while also ensuring we have more than enough capacity to meet expected demand. On a year-over-year basis, our gross margin will be impacted by product line mix from lower drug delivery revenue, higher costs associated with our US manufacturing ramp, product mix, including ramping Omnipod 5, manufacturing components due to inflation and warranty costs. We expect these headwinds to be partially offset by the benefit of increasing volume in the US pharmacy channel. We expect unfavorable product mix, the US manufacturing ramp, as well as inflation and supply chain macro-related headwinds to continue to impact our results for the next couple of years. We expect operating expenses to rise year-over-year, driven by ongoing investments in our sales and marketing efforts, including the launch of Omnipod 5, and increasing DTC advertising, as well as expanding our innovation pipeline and clinical efforts and scaling our support functions. Excluding the legal and CEO transition costs, we now expect operating margin to be in the high single-digits as a result of the gross margin reduction and the macro environment creating inflationary and foreign exchange pressures. Lastly, we continue to expect capital expenditures to increase slightly due to ongoing investments in key areas of our business. Turning to our third quarter 2022 revenue guidance. We expect total company growth of 17% to 20%, including Omnipod growth of 18% to 21%. Based on current foreign currency exchange rates, we estimate the impact will be approximately 500 basis points on a reported basis for total revenue. For US Omnipod, we expect growth of 24% to 27%, driven by the benefits of our recurring revenue model, growing Omnipod DASH volume through the US pharmacy channel and ramping contributions from Omnipod 5. We expect Q3 international Omnipod growth of 7% to 10%, driven by the ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by competitive AID headwinds and the compounding impact on new customer starts in 2021 and into 2022, largely due to the pandemic. We estimate the unfavorable foreign exchange impact will be approximately 1,300 basis points on a reported basis. Finally, we expect Q3 drug delivery revenue to decline 14% to 5% as revenue is normalizing to pre-pandemic levels. In conclusion, we\u2019ve achieved a number of critical milestones that further position Insulet for growth. While there continues to be macro-related challenges, these are exciting times with the full market release of Omnipod 5, now fully available through retail pharmacies, and soon, CE Mark approval for Omnipod 5 internationally. We\u2019re on track to deliver another strong year of revenue growth and new customer growth, while also investing in key areas throughout our global business, in order to drive future growth and sustain long-term value creation. With that, Dilem, please open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] I show our first question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Larry Biegelsen : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on a nice quarter and you know the full market release of Omnipod 5. Wayde, I actually wanted to start with the margins, given that that was you know a pretty big change here. So, I\u2019m totally understandable what\u2019s happening this year to the gross margin and the OpEx. I\u2019d love some color you know on how you\u2019re thinking about you know gross margin and operating margin in Q3 and Q4. And when do you think you can get back to that 70% gross margin that you recently had? And how are you thinking about leverage beyond 2022? Thanks for taking the question. Wayde McMillan : Hi, Larry. So for our margins, as you mentioned, we stepped them down this quarter for both some micro and macro issues. You know I think as has been well publicized across many companies, the macro environment is tough, both from an inflationary and foreign exchange, and we\u2019ve felt that as well. We also have a couple of things that impacted us in the quarter. You saw us talk about our warranty increase on our PDMs as well as some of the volume that we\u2019re increasing in our Acton facility. And then just a highlight for folks. You saw us take down our gross margin guidance for drug delivery. That\u2019s a higher margin product line. And so when we reduce revenue guidance there, that\u2019s a headwind for us. And then we\u2019ve increased our volume for Omnipod 5. Our expectations for Omnipod 5 are growing even above what we originally thought. And cost of goods sold are slightly higher for Omnipod 5 as well. So, although that\u2019s a good thing that we\u2019re growing volumes with Omnipod 5, it is a headwind to our cost of goods sold. So that creates about a 2% impact to gross margins, and that really is what drops through to operating margins. We also have other inflationary headwinds throughout operating expenses, given the wage environment as well as services and other increased costs out there that most companies are dealing with. So that\u2019s the reason that we changed our guidance. It\u2019s a little too early to tell what expectations will be beyond 2022, we have to monitor closely the macro environment here. What we do know is that, we are paying higher cost for inputs, raw materials and components to build capacity. And you can see it in our inventory as we continue to grow inventory, our operations teams are doing a great job of identifying capacity and growing inventory in this environment, but it is coming at a higher cost. And with the inventory that we\u2019ve built, a lot of that is deferred over a six-month period of time. And so that\u2019s already starting to impact what our gross margins will be next year. So, although we\u2019re very happy to be building inventory and developing extra capacity, it does come at a higher cost. And so that\u2019s going to impact us for some time. But we\u2019re not going to look out beyond that at this point, Larry. I think we\u2019ve got to monitor the macro environment and see what it looks like. What we are going to commit to is that over time, we will continue to expand gross margins and operating margins, that\u2019s a key focus for us. It may not be in any particular year, especially with the macro headwinds that we\u2019re dealing with today. But you can count on us to continue to expand margins over time. Larry Biegelsen : Thank you. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Robert Marcus from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Robbie Marcus : Great. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a nice quarter. As it relates to the US new patient starts, I\u2019m surprised, Omnipod 5 was already over 25%. I would imagine the exit rate is even higher than that. Maybe you could just talk about the types of patients you\u2019re seeing? Are these new to therapy? Are these switching from other therapies? How high a percentage of new patient mix do you think Omnipod 5 will settle out as? And is this in the short-term at all changing your Type 1 and Type 2 mix? Thanks a lot. Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Robbie. Thanks for the congratulations, too. I think it\u2019s a little bit early to say about how the rates are going to settle out. We\u2019re very happy with adoption of Omnipod 5 across the board. As we said, you know more than 80% of our new customer starts are patients coming from MDI, and so \u2013 you know that\u2019s our target market. We are seeing a high percentage of patients converting from Omnipod DASH. And you know to me, that\u2019s a great sign of demand, because what it shows is that, patients who are already on the Omnipod experience, we know they\u2019ve been waiting for Omnipod 5. And so we\u2019re actually, I think, getting a somewhat higher percentage of conversions already. And if you remember, during limited market release, what we\u2019ve been telling the market is the fastest way to get an Omnipod 5 is to get an Omnipod DASH and then convert. So we\u2019re seeing that very well. And we are seeing conversions from other tubed pump offerings. And so we\u2019re getting a mix across the board, and we\u2019re really happy with that. Bret Christensen : Hey, Robbie, it\u2019s Bret. Just to draft in here a little bit. You asked about the exit rate. So yeah, good pickup there. 25% was our mix for the entire quarter. So remember, we just entered a full market release. And so as you can imagine, the ramp throughout the quarter, really the exit rate was quite a bit higher than 25%. So, we\u2019re in a great spot going into Q3, you should expect that Q3 is going to be a much higher mix of our new starts as Omnipod 5. The other thing to remember is, I know many of you look at IQVIA data to sort of understand what new starts are, there\u2019s a component there called NRx, which is usually a really good way to take a look at new prescriptions on a product. For Omnipod 5, it\u2019s pretty high. And there\u2019s just some things to keep in mind there. One, Jim called out the percent of conversion. So we have a very large percentage of new to Omnipod 5 that are conversions from our legacy products. The other thing to remember is that, Omnipod 5 requires two prescriptions. So it requires a prescription for a starter kit and a refill of pods. And so, as you look at the IQVIA data, you\u2019re just going to want to make sure that you\u2019re only viewing one of those. And that you remember that, the majority of new to Omnipod is conversions. But we\u2019re thrilled to be in full market release, and the team is excited to just be \u2013 in full promotion mode starting Q3. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Travis Steed from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Travis Steed : Hey. Congrats and thanks for taking the question. Wayde, I was looking at the guidance for US Omnipod growth specifically in the US and the first half was about 26%, and the guide for the full year 23% to 26%. So it seems a little bit of a step down in the second half, but you do have the COVID comps going away and Omnipod 5 launching. So I wanted to get some color on the second half specifically. And then on the $7 million of stocking, our inventory build with Omnipod 5 this quarter. How much of that was assumed in the Q2 guidance? Thank you. Wayde McMillan : Yeah. Hi, Travis, it\u2019s glad you asked this question, we get to provide a little more color here. So first of all, you called out the $7 million of channel inventory build, and that\u2019s something that you have to factor into the first half, second half as you\u2019re thinking about the guidance. The other thing to normalize for is, we had an incredibly strong Q4 last year, and so that creates a tough comp for us. So if you include normalization for the channel build, and think about the tough comp, the second half is actually a stronger percentage growth rate and certainly on an absolute dollar basis, a much higher than the first half. So we\u2019ve got a really strong US guide into the second half of the year. And on the channel inventory build, we don\u2019t factor in any major channel build into our guidance. You know we do factor some trends and some normal order patterns and some normal stocking. But whenever we see a large material or significant channel build or channel destock, we call them out, just like we have in the past. And so as we talked about in the prepared remarks here, we\u2019re going to continue to see Omnipod 5 inventory ramp. That will be offset by reductions of our classic Omnipod and Omnipod DASH at our distributors. And depending on how that matches up or is mismatched, it could result in an inventory channel build. And so again, when we see it material, we\u2019ll factor that in and let you guys know in our prepared remarks. But from here, we typically don\u2019t build in large stocking or destocking into our guidance. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Steve Lichtman from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Steve Lichtman : Thank you. Hi, guys. Just on your clinical programs, what is the latest outlook for a Type 2 pivotal study? And on the clinical study you mentioned versus non-AID, are you hoping to use that for enhanced reimbursement? Have you received feedback from payers that that is possible? Thanks a lot. Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Steve. On the Type 2 program, we\u2019ve launched \u2013 obviously, we have first [technical difficulty] 2 patients very successfully with Omnipod DASH, where we have an indication for use. And as we said in our prepared comments, we had roughly 30% of our new customer starts where people with Type 2 diabetes, and we continue to grow that year-over-year. So we\u2019re very confident that we have a great experience for people with Type 2 diabetes already, fantastic form factor, great pay-as-you-go model and access to the pharmacy, all of which are differentiated. But we are working on Type 2 pipeline. And as you know, we published fantastic feasibility data with Omnipod 5 for patients with Type 2. We published that earlier in the year at ATTD in Barcelona. And based on that study, we\u2019re in conversation with the FDA about the protocol for a pivotal trial. And as we get closer on that, we\u2019ll tell the market more about it. And I\u2019m going to turn to Deb to talk about the randomized controlled trial. Deborah Gordon : Yeah. Hi, how are you? We\u2019re excited about the randomized controlled trial. And you\u2019re right, we are doing that in order to grow our clinical body of evidence, but also it\u2019s really focused on driving access and reimbursement in our international markets. You know as you\u2019re aware, we\u2019re \u2013 we consider ourselves our own category with the tubeless AID system. And what we want to do is, chart out reimbursement specific for our offering that we know will be well received internationally, and it will help, we believe, with the strength of the data from the RCT should help us with negotiating pricing and setting reimbursement in countries where that either is not reimbursement today with AID or certainly, we want to get higher reimbursement for our offering. So, really excited about doing the study. We are in the United States and France, because they\u2019re two of our largest markets. And in fact, we actually very early on in the enrollment process, but we already have almost 50 people enrolled in seven sites in our US market, and we\u2019ll be soon enrolling our new first patients in press. So really excited. It\u2019s just one of the many levers that we are pulling in order to get ourselves ready to launch next year in our international markets with Omnipod 5. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale from Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Chris Pasquale : Thanks and congrats on the quarter guys. Wade, I want to circle back on margins. You talked about a lot of the puts and takes on gross margin, but SG&A was up meaningfully year-over-year, even if you back out some of the one-time stuff. Just curious, was there anything to call out there? And how do you think about that moving forward? And then one just detail on O 5. Are you getting a price premium there versus DASH? Some of the prescription data suggests that it might be priced a little higher. Thank you. Wayde McMillan : Hey, Chris, I\u2019ll start it, and I\u2019ll pass it over to Bret on the questions on Omnipod 5. So regarding SG&A, you may have caught it in the prepared remarks, we talked about increasing our investment in direct-to-consumer advertising on the front end of Omnipod 5, and we certainly have a lot of investment for Omnipod 5, both here in the US as we prepared for the full market release and worked our way through the limited market release. And then internationally, we\u2019ve got a significant amount of work going across many functions, marketing, and in particular, in IT, and we\u2019ve got a significant amount of work to do country-by-country from the infrastructure that needs to be built to support our cloud infrastructure and what we have you know to bring with our Omnipod 5 system is really this differentiated system that works in the cloud and brings a lot of benefits to both the HCPs and the customers. And so we\u2019re working on that. It\u2019s different in every country outside the US. We have to be aware of the privacy laws and other things. So, a lot of investment there, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing show up in our SG&A today. And I\u2019ll pass it over to Bret on Omnipod 5. Bret Christensen : Yeah. Hi, Chris. The pricing of Omnipod 5 versus DASH, remember, we said we would price it at parity to DASH, and we\u2019re sticking to that. So we are offering payers the exact same rebates for Omnipod 5 that we offered for DASH. The exception to that \u2013 and the reason you might see some discrepancies in pricing are mainly around mix. And remember, Omnipod 5 is a pharmacy-only product. So we did have a few payers that were in DME that we are not offering Omnipod 5 in DME and so they do have to move to the pharmacy channel. So that will cause you know a little bit of price lift, frankly, in the pharmacy channel for the average pod pricing, but per payer, there\u2019s pricing at parity with just a few exceptions. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from Citi. Please go ahead. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you for taking the question and nice quarter. As you prepare for the international launch of Omnipod 5, what have you learned so far in the limited version here in the US that you can take over there? And should we think of a limited launch in the international market arena also? Thanks. Bret Christensen : Yeah, Joanne, this is Bret. Yeah, you know most of the learnings from the US, we can translate to a European launch. And so remember, there\u2019s a lot to learn from Omnipod 5. It\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s self-service, there\u2019s different training. We\u2019ve learned a lot with training and support in coordination with Dexcom, our CGM partner. So all of those will serve us well when we launch in Europe. There\u2019s still work to do. And Jim mentioned, you know we are well on our way to CE Mark in Europe. And we\u2019ve still got work to do even after CE Mark. So, you know we are targeting middle of \u201823 for the first markets in Europe to come on board, and that will \u2013 that effort will move into \u201824, because they are going to be staggered launches. So there\u2019s work to do with the cloud. And remember, we\u2019re pioneering here. You know, we are going to be the first company that\u2019s getting real-time data on every single user. So we\u2019re putting a SIM card in PDMs. We\u2019re building a cloud that meets the requirements of every country. And then we\u2019re assessing the reimbursement environment. We\u2019ve got to establish reimbursement for an AID system that is Omnipod, and we\u2019re looking at the potential for different pricing in those markets. So, all-in-all, there\u2019s work to be done even after CE Mark, and you can expect those launches to come in a staggered fashion starting in the middle of \u201823. Jim Hollingshead : I\u2019ll just tag on the back of that, Bret, that one thing to bear in mind is, you know as we launch Omnipod 5 and we go market-by-market, with all of that work we\u2019re doing to pioneer the cloud-based offerings, we\u2019re also digging a huge moat. We\u2019re going to do it sequentially. We\u2019re going to do it right and we\u2019re going to do it to win. It will be very difficult for anybody to follow. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Cecilia Furlong from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Cecilia Furlong : Hey, good afternoon and thank you for taking the question. I wanted to ask if you could just provide a bit more color just in terms of takeaways from your limited distribution period, what was incorporated or adjustments that you made as you transition to full market launch? And then kind of on the heels of that, too, just your free trial period with Omnipod 5, that really the rationale shifting from 30-days to 10-days? And thank you for taking the question. Bret Christensen : Yeah, Cecilia, this is Bret. So you know the list is long of what we learned in the LMR. And you know we\u2019re thrilled again to be moving to full market release. But we commented on some of what we\u2019ve learned. A lot has to do with the onboarding experience. We adjusted the trading protocols, some of the self-service options, some of the expectation setting for those that might be coming from an AID system versus MDI, there\u2019s a lot to learn there, and we got really comfortable with that, which is why we\u2019re moving to full market release. Jim Hollingshead : And the second part was, I think are on the free trials. Bret Christensen : The free trials. Certainly, yes. So, the 10-days is a great question, because we are committed to free trial with Omnipod 5, and you know it was a 30-day free trial with DASH. And while we wanted to do that same trial with Omnipod 5, Omnipod 5 is a system that includes the Dexcom, CGM. So, that was really in coordination with our partner there and Dexcom, as they offer a free 10-day trial, we want to make sure that we\u2019re not offering a trial that doesn\u2019t include a CGM. So a lot of work there and a lot of coordination that went into that, but we\u2019re committed to doing free trials for Omnipod 5, and it\u2019s something you will see us continue to offer. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Please go ahead. Margaret Kaczor : Hey, good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the question. So I wanted to follow-up a little bit on the inventory build and kind of what that means for domestic patient adds. Just as I was playing with our model quickly, you know even if you take out that $7 million, it still seems like those domestic patient adds grew at a faster clip than expected. So you know can you give us any sense of whether new patient adds domestically, for example, grew faster than overall domestic revenue growth or you know that\u2019s too strong to say? And then you know on the inventory side, were you able to talk to distributors in terms of why they wanted to build up so much demand? You know is it because they\u2019re seeing it, if you\u2019re around lack of supply? Or they\u2019re hearing from patients already that they need to be ready? Thanks. Wayde McMillan : Sure. Hey, Margaret, it\u2019s Wayde. Why don\u2019t I start with the inventory and maybe a little on the new product adds, I\u2019ll pass it over to Bret, because he\u2019s got the insights from the team. So on the inventory build, you know some of this is just timing and the way it happened you know as we shifted from limited market release into full market release. And you know limited market release, as you recall, we stepped into it by adding in mail order pharmacies, specialty pharmacies, but held back on the large you know bolus of retail pharmacies. And when we then move to the retail pharmacies, that\u2019s when we had significant inventory to move into the channel so that those wholesalers and distributors can feed as Jim said in his prepared remarks, the 88,000 retail pharmacies across the country. And so that\u2019s just timing. And we\u2019ll continue to build inventory with Omnipod 5, and it just depends on the end of the quarter where we\u2019re at with the reductions on the DASH and classic, if we have more inventory builds in the future. But you\u2019re right, it does speak to the excitement out there and the demand that\u2019s building out there, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re trying to get as much channel inventory out there as soon as we can now, because of the access as Jim mentioned as well in his prepared remarks, we\u2019re well ahead on access. That was one of the other major metrics that we were managing in order to go to full market release. And now that we\u2019re over 50% access out there, there are many people that can get prescriptions and now get Omnipod 5. So it\u2019s pretty exciting to see the inventory stocking in the channel and all the pharmacies across the country that people be able to access the product in. And from a domestic adds standpoint, you\u2019re right, that is one of the reasons that we exceeded the high end of our guidance this quarter. We don\u2019t get a significant amount of revenue from new customer starts in any particular quarter, just because of the annuity-based model that we\u2019re in that I know you\u2019re familiar with. But, Bret, any color you want to add on the domestic adds? Bret Christensen : Yeah. Margaret, I mean, it\u2019s \u2013 you know this inventory build is almost something that\u2019s just unavoidable with a product launch like Omnipod 5. I mean, ideally, you\u2019d love to see the DASH inventory drop at the same rate that Omnipod 5 is going up. But look, we try to project this as well as we can and communicate with our distributors. And I think it\u2019s fair to say demand just exceeded our expectations here, you know especially with conversions. So the one thing we have to point to was when we launched DASH, we did see conversions from our legacy product, but demand for Omnipod 5 is just much different. And we have podders who have been waiting for Omnipod 5 for a long time. And that is \u2013 you know we just saw a lot more conversions, a lot more demand, and that resulted in a little bit of inventory build. But again, it\u2019s healthy, and we try to keep it to a minimum. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Jayson Bedford : Good afternoon and congrats on the progress. Jim, you\u2019ve said \u2013 I embark for yourself with the quarter here, at least in the US. I wanted to ask on the international, it was down quarter-on-quarter, the model typically doesn\u2019t lend itself to sequential declines. And I realized FX was probably a bit of a factor here. But why was 2Q international revenue down quarter-on-quarter? And it looks like the implied 3Q was kind of flat to down slightly as well? So a little detail there. Thanks. Wayde McMillan : Sure, Jayson, it\u2019s Wayde. I can take that one. And this is what we\u2019ve seen historically as well. So we do get this question from time to time. It\u2019s typically when we see that sequential down. And it\u2019s certainly an understandable question, because it\u2019s an annuity model. But what we see happening across our international business, and this is the case in prior years as well. Because we sell a lot of our revenue through the distribution channel, we have ebbs and flows in the distributor inventory patterns and order patterns and depends at the end and beginning of quarters where we\u2019re at and fulfilling those orders. So, it lends itself to be a little bit more difficult to understand, because it is an annuity model. But that\u2019s it. You\u2019ve also seen us call out internationally, whenever we\u2019ve had stocking or destocking of a material nature, you\u2019ve seen us call that out as well. So when we don\u2019t, and we see a couple of million dollar swings between the quarters, it\u2019s really just an order trend and nothing that we\u2019re concerned about or I think we should be calling out as well. And as we move into the second half of the year, you\u2019re right, Q3 goes up, but we typically see a seasonal decline in Q4 as well. And that\u2019s some of the distributors, I think, managing their inventory at the calendar year end. And so, really nothing to talk about here, Jayson, other than just some normal inventory trends. And you know again, we\u2019ll call it out when we see anything material. Operator : Thank you. And I show next question comes from the line of Joshua Jennings from Cowen. Please go ahead. Brian Kennedy : This is Brian for Josh. Thank you for taking my question. On the cost of therapy, a competitor cited patients delaying pump purchases, specifically because of the upfront cost. How big of a factor do you judge cost to be as a driver for Omnipod 5 adoption? And do you have an ability to or, I guess, an interest in lowering current co-pays further should pump manufacturers introduce payment plans that match the typical co-pay? Bret Christensen : Hi, Josh, it\u2019s Bret, Brian, sorry. We think cost is very important. And it\u2019s one of the reasons why years ago, we decided to move to the pharmacy channel, more importantly, move to a pay-as-you-go model, because it is \u2013 the upfront fee is very disruptive and very difficult for patients, especially if they have not met their deductibles. So you know for us, we don\u2019t see these type of headwinds and these fluctuations, because the co-pays in the pharmacy are predictable and they\u2019re low. And remember, the majority \u2013 the vast majority of our patients pay something less than $50. So the average is much lower than that. And as Jim said, many pay zero. So you know the pay-as-you-go model is really important. We topped that off with free trial, you know and you can try Omnipod for free, if you want to. And then, I think the final part of your question is about lowering co-pays, and that\u2019s just an effort we\u2019re always making. And we talk about that as functional access. So we want to do a few things. We want to remove prior offs. We want to remove high co-pays. And in some cases, we\u2019re willing to give up a little bit on the rebate percentage with payers if we can get that accomplished, because we want to remove every obstacle we can to get it on Omnipod. Operator : Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Matthew O\u2019Brien from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Matthew O\u2019Brien: Hey, afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. So, Wayde, I think you kind of started talking about this. But if you adjust for that inventory build in Q2, you know you grew on a stack two-year basis you know low 20% you know in Q2, low 20% in Q1. Now you\u2019re expecting this big bump in Q3, Q4, kind of the more of the mid-20s on a two-year stack basis. So, where is that growth specifically expected to come from? Is it an acceleration in the Type 1 patient population? Is it more conversion from existing pump users? I mean, where is that really coming from here in the US? Thanks. Wayde McMillan : Yeah, Matt. I\u2019m not sure I quite followed all that math. But I think if I followed you right, what you\u2019re saying is you know first half, you know strong growth rates. And if you do normalize for that $7 million channel inventory build, we have about a 26% growth rate in the US in Q2. And so, then you take that and you look at the second half guide, where, as you said, we\u2019re in the mid-20s, and that\u2019s a strong guide for us, especially given that tough competitive comp we have in Q4 of last year was such a strong quarter. And then, where is the growth going to come from? It\u2019s all the above, Matt. It\u2019s pretty exciting. As you know, all of the drivers that we\u2019ve had in the business before Omnipod 5 are really what are continuing to drive the business here. The pay-as-you-go model, the DASH product itself, all the economic benefits that Bret just mentioned. And so, as well as the differentiated opportunity we have in Type 2 in the pharmacy channel. So, a lot of drivers, and that is going to be what continues to drive the business. And then Omnipod 5 at 25% of the new customer starts here in Q2 will continue to be a driver as that continues to ramp. So, you know we\u2019ve got a lot of growth momentum in the US, and I think the guidance reflects that. Operator : Thank you. And I show our last question comes from the line of Dane Reinhardt from Baird. Please go ahead. Jeff Johnson : Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. This is actually Jeff on for Dane. I apologize on having some phone issues today. But two questions, I guess. One, Wayde, just clarifying, we keep talking about the $7 million stocking tailwind in the second quarter. I thought you said some of that was netted out between old Omnipod 5 inventory coming out. Should we be thinking about that as a one-timer of $7 million? Or is it a little less than that? And then, Jim, just wanted to ask you, you know this is your first full quarter now as CEO or first quarter as CEO, spending is going way up. Is this conceptually how we should think about you, you\u2019re a revenue guy, you\u2019re going to drive revenue and cost be damned or at least cost don\u2019t matter in the near-term, we are going to push the top line in the competitive mode as much as possible. Just trying to understand your style here, maybe. Thanks. Wayde McMillan : Sure. Hey, Jeff, I was a little disappointed actually if you weren\u2019t going to be on. So it was great to hear your voice. And I\u2019ll just answer the first part really quickly. The $7 million is net. So that is the net impact of Omnipod 5 inventory ramping and classic Omnipod and DASH coming down. Jim Hollingshead : Jeff, thanks for your question. And I actually love your question. And it\u2019s \u2013 by the way, it\u2019s great to be here on my first quarter, and I\u2019m loving this, and we have a great team and a great strategy, and we have incredibly talented people and so much passion. But an answer to your question, I don\u2019t think you should think of me as somebody who\u2019s going to you know, cost be damned. We have massive growth opportunities in front of us. You know our investment thesis remains the same, which is, we\u2019re going to drive Omnipod 5. We\u2019re going to drive successful launch and successful growth with Omnipod 5. We\u2019re going to continue to drive international growth with DASH. We\u2019re going to continue to drive Type 2 growth with DASH. And we\u2019re going to fund all of our great innovations that are coming to market, but we\u2019re going to be very prudent with cost and how we do that. You know, we\u2019re obviously in a macro environment that presents a lot of challenges. We are not immune to that. You know that\u2019s happening across industries, it\u2019s happening in our industry. So we\u2019re going to be very prudent with costs and we\u2019re very mindful of that. But we have fantastic growth in front of us, and we\u2019re going to capture it. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our Q&A session. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Jim Hollingshead, President and CEO for closing remarks. Please go ahead, sir. Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Dilem, and thanks, everyone for joining us today. We\u2019ve made terrific progress in the second quarter, and we\u2019re on track for another successful year, despite having to navigate through the challenging macro environment. The full market release of Omnipod 5 is an exciting milestone, and we\u2019re really thrilled to be in full market release with that offering. And our goal is to drive that growth and to finish the year strong and sustain our growth for the long-term. I\u2019ve been really inspired \u2013 just on a personal note, I\u2019ve been truly inspired in my first two months here as CEO. We\u2019re making great progress. We are changing people\u2019s lives. We\u2019ve got great and talented people. We have one of the best management teams in MedTech, and we\u2019ve got phenomenal offerings. Insulet has never been in a better position to deliver on our mission to simplify and improve the lives of people at diabetes. Thanks, everyone, and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct the question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President of Investor Relations. Deborah Gordon : Thank you, Dilem. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Insulet's third quarter 2022 earnings call. With me today are; Jim Hollingshead, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Wayde McMillan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Bret Christensen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, is also with us today for the Q&A portion of our call. Both the replay of this call and the press release discussing our 2022 third quarter results and 2022 guidance will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking, and could materially differ from current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such statements. We\u2019ll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely adjusted operating margin, adjusted EBITDA and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. These measures align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance, and we believe they are helpful to investors, analysts and other interested parties as measures of our operating performance from period to period. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis with the exception of revenue growth rate, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim. Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. The third quarter marked a continuation of our strong revenue performance, new customer growth and strategic progress. We increased our full year revenue outlook and the entire Insulet team continues to execute at a high level and advance our mission. We're focused on finishing the year strong and carrying sustained momentum into 2023. In Q3, we achieved several notable milestones. We once again delivered record U.S. and global new customer starts which helped us achieve a remarkable 42% year-over-year growth in the U.S., our highest U.S. revenue growth rate in at least a decade. This was driven in large part by an incredible start for our U.S. full market release for our revolutionary Omnipod 5 automated insulin delivery system. The feedback on Omnipod 5 from our Podders and their caregivers continues to be fantastic. And of course, we are far from finished. We continue to work to expand access to Omnipod 5 as well as increase the total addressable market for our Omnipod platform. During the quarter, we expanded Omnipod 5's indication down to H2 and secured CE Mark. We also continue to drive growth with Omnipod DASH, both in our international markets and in the U.S., especially in the type 2 diabetes market. Building on that, we are incredibly excited to announce that we have developed and will soon submit a 510(k) for a new basal-only PODD to accelerate our future growth in type 2. It's a clear indication of our commitment to further innovate for people with diabetes and expand our addressable market, and I'll share more about this in a few moments. We could not be more excited about what's yet to come for insulin and our customers. The market enthusiasm for Omnipod 5 is greater than even we anticipated. Demand is coming from all across the market. Our core target market of MDI users is growing ahead of our own forecast and continues to be the greatest source of new customers for us. But we are also seeing significant increases in customer conversions. Current Omnipod users are converting to Omnipod 5 at a much higher rate than we saw with previous product launches, demonstrating that even current Podders see Omnipod 5 as a breakthrough offering. In addition to those coming from MDI, we are seeing significant volumes of customers converting from tubed pump technologies. And in many cases, we are winning back customers who had once been Podders. Thousands of people returning to us and adopting Omnipod 5. And this strong demand also comes from all age groups. We achieved record new customer starts with both adult and pediatric users. In Q3, after only two months of its full market release, Omnipod 5 represented over 80% of U.S. new customer starts compared to over 25% in Q2. This validates the power of Omnipod 5 and the competitive advantages it offers. It is the only tubeless AID system with an adaptive algorithm that works as designed right out of the box, delivering high time and range. The algorithm then learns from each patient's specific usage and automatically personalizes care over the first 2 or 3 pods. Because of that personalization, we are seeing consistent reports of increased time and range, reduction in A1c and markedly low hypoglycemia. It is the combination of clinical effectiveness and our unique Omnipod platform that is fueling our success. As a result, our historical 80-20 mix of those coming from MDI and traditional tubed pumps is changing. In Q3, we saw an estimated 60-40 split due to significantly more competitive takeaways. We're excited by our early progress and are gratified to see how Omnipod 5 is transforming diabetes management. We have long believed that superior innovation, offering simplicity, discretion and improved outcomes, will drive adoption in our large underpenetrated markets. Omnipod 5 is demonstrating this to be true. Omnipod 5 offers more than any other AID system on the market, including a number of market firsts. It's the first pod-based AID system, the first fully compatible phone-controlled AID system the first system that no one has to plug in to access data and the first AID system with a predictive algorithm, our smart bolus calculator, that directly incorporates not just blood glucose levels, but also blood glucose trends. And the stories are inspiring. We recently heard from a health care practitioner who has patients on Omnipod 5, several of whom called her related about the dramatic improvements in their diabetes management. This HCP said she and her patients are amazed with our system. And for the first time, they have been in range 100% of the time. They called their experience \"life-changing\". It's clear Omnipod 5 is making it easier for our customers and their caregivers to manage diabetes, and it's simplifying the interaction between patients and their HCPs. We expect Omnipod 5's contribution to further accelerate growth as we gain additional market traction and increased commercial coverage. To that end, we've made significant strides with access. And by the end of Q3, we secured coverage for over 80% of U.S. covered lives for Omnipod 5, well ahead of our initial expectations. We have also experienced a few challenges that we are hitting head on. The incredible market response has placed pressure on our onboarding capabilities, particularly incoming call volumes. Additionally, the voluntary medical device correction we initiated last month for our Omnipod DASH personal diabetes managers in response to the battery issue we identified also slightly elevated call volumes. Given this, we are in the process of carefully reviewing the early field data on the Omnipod 5 controller to ensure it meets our high expectations for safety and user satisfaction. We have received a few inbound calls highlighting a potential issue related to charging the controller. Our work is ongoing and if we ultimately decide to take a particular action, you can expect it to be swift and transparent. Every single aspect of the Omnipod 5 experience is important to us. We are investing to increase our onboarding and call center resources, and are already seeing significantly improved response times. We're driving customer growth through our access and awareness efforts. We have a differentiated business model and a unique leadership position in the U.S. pharmacy channel. Both make access to our technology extremely simple, efficient and affordable, which further differentiates Omnipod during challenging economic times. We have long focused on improving functional access for our customers. As a result, the vast majority of our U.S. customers continue to pay less than $50 a month through the pharmacy channel for both Omnipod DASH and Omnipod 5, and the average co-pay is less than $50. Consistent with our commitment to drive expanded access, we are proud to offer our technology at a similar cost to multiple daily injections, while also delivering improved outcomes and quality of life. We also remain focused on the benefits our model provides to physicians and payers. Our pay-as-you-go model makes access easier and more affordable for customers while also eliminating lengthy lock-in periods. At the same time, it provides a superior value proposition and is less expensive for payers. We eliminate the large upfront costs that are common in the durable medical equipment channel with traditional tube pumps, which make those offerings far more expensive, especially since individuals in the U.S. change insurance plans every couple of years on average. In addition to growing our strong position in the type 1 market, our initiatives are also key drivers of our leadership in the type two space. People with type 2 diabetes are becoming increasingly comfortable with an on-body tubeless device, and we offer an unmatched user experience with Omnipod DASH and classic Omnipod. We were pleased with the recent local coverage determination proposal that would provide CGM coverage for basal insulin patients. This proposal, if approved, increases access to CGMs. At the same time, CGM awareness is rising, and we are well positioned to capitalize on this market expansion opportunity. Today, we're a leader in the type 2 space, and now we are taking this a step further with another novel innovation. We have developed a version of Omnipod specifically designed to treat type 2 patients on basal-only therapy, which we plan to submit to the FDA in a few days. It should greatly improve both the user experience and adherence by completely removing the use of needles. It is the perfect product for people with needle phobia and others who may struggle with adherence to daily or weekly injections. The total addressable market for our basal-only pod is estimated to be approximately three million people in the U.S. alone. It leverages our unique Omnipod platform, including auto insertion, comfortable wear and affordable access through the U.S. pharmacy channel, creating a winning first-of-its-kind product for this population. The basal-only pod is incredibly simple to use and requires no controller or phone application to deliver a fixed rate of rapid-acting insulin for 72 continuous hours. This new innovation allows early entry into the type 2 treatment pathway, gets patients comfortable with Pod Therapy and creates a clear pathway for them to adopt other Omnipod product offerings as their insulin needs evolve. Pending regulatory clearance, we plan to begin U.S. commercialization in 2024. Our basal-only pod is expected to drive TAM expansion and revenue growth for years to come while further improving the lives of people with diabetes. This innovation builds upon our leadership position in the type 2 market. During the third quarter, individuals with type 2 represented an estimated 15% to 20% of our U.S. new customer starts. As expected, this percentage is declining given our success driving Omnipod 5 adoption in the type 1 market. However, we remain confident that the simplicity of our Omnipod 5 platform represents a significant competitive advantage that will allow us to expand our customer base in both the type 1 and type 2 populations. As a reminder, like all AID systems, Omnipod 5 is currently indicated for use only for people with type 1 diabetes. However, the number of individuals with type 2 adopting Omnipod DASH remains very strong. Serving the type 2 population is a priority for us, and we are confident the combination of our form factor, access model and innovative product portfolio will continue to drive customer adoption. Another area of focus is advancing our clinical efforts. Our Omnipod 5 randomized controlled trial is progressing well. We're on track to complete enrollment of 120 participants in the U.S. and expect to soon begin enrollment of up to 80 participants in France. We believe the results will demonstrate Omnipod 5's benefits compared to non-AID pump use with CGM. We are confident this will strengthen our position to secure broad reimbursement and pricing for Omnipod 5 in our international markets. As I mentioned, we were excited to receive our expanded indication down to age two for Omnipod 5. We are a leader in the pediatric segment and are confident Omnipod 5 will truly change the lives of these young children and their families. Based on our positive Omnipod 5 type 2 feasibility study results, I'm happy to share that we expect to begin a type 2 pivotal trial for Omnipod 5 in 2023. We continue to advance our robust innovation pipeline with a focus on future AID offerings as well as building our digital and data capabilities. Our iOS integration work is ongoing as is our development work to integrate Omnipod 5 with DexCom's G7 and Abbott's CGMs. We remain committed to building on our product offering and also providing CGM of choice to our customers. Our investments in R&D and innovation are a strategic priority that we fully expect will drive sustainable long-term growth and continued value creation. Our priorities in this area are clear : complete integration with our CGM partners, grow our global addressable markets and create digital and data-driven products to simplify diabetes management for both customers and caregivers. One especially important feature Omnipod 5 offers is real-time usage data feeds. This simplifies diabetes management for patients and their physicians. Looking ahead, we will be in a strong position to use that data to further enhance the patient experience, improve workflows for physicians and build on our competitive advantages. Moving to our international operations. We were pleased to receive CE Mark for Omnipod 5 in September. This represents a major step in our path to deliver Omnipod 5 to people globally. We remain focused on building the necessary cloud-based infrastructure needed to deliver the Omnipod 5 experience while ensuring compliance with local data protection regulations. At the same time, we're developing country-specific launch plans and continuing our work to drive premium reimbursement. We expect to enter our first international market in mid-2023. Given our planned stage approach, we will roll out Omnipod 5 more broadly throughout 2024. Lastly, our global manufacturing capabilities support our long-term growth trajectory and serve as another competitive moat. Global supply chain and macro-related headwinds remain, but we are addressing the needs of our expanding global customer base and supporting the adoption ramp of Omnipod 5. Our team has secured components and built product ahead of our forecasted capacity needs. While this results in increased cost that impact margins, they are necessary to deliver uninterrupted products for our customers. Although our U.S. manufacturing will continue to be a headwind to gross margin given the higher production costs, over the long term, we are confident all of our sites combined will continue to deliver the highest quality product and gross margin expansion. Our U.S. manufacturing has allowed us to build redundancy, capabilities and gain key learnings that are driving efficiency, quality and productivity improvements across all our facilities. In closing, we once again achieved notable financial, commercial and operational milestones and are focused on finishing year strong. With our customers at the center of everything we do, our entire Insulet team is executing our global mission and strengthening our foundation for sustainable long-term growth. I will now turn the call over to Wayde. Wayde McMillan : Thanks, Jim. Q3 marked another record-breaking quarter. Our global team continues to execute at a high level. And Omnipod 5 is proving to be a life-changing new option for people with diabetes. We're focused on finishing the year strong and entering 2023 with momentum. We generated 29% revenue growth in the third quarter finishing above the high end of our guidance range, driven by total Omnipod growth of 30%. On a reported basis, for total revenue, foreign currency was a 480 basis point headwind compared to Q3 of last year. U.S. Omnipod revenue growth was 42%, exceeding our guidance range. Revenue growth continues to be driven by the compounding benefit from record new customer starts and increasing volume through the U.S. pharmacy channel. This includes a growing contribution from Omnipod 5 and a premium for the pod given we provide the PDM at no charge in the pharmacy channel. Growth in the quarter included an estimated $16 million benefit associated with the initial quarter of Omnipod 5 volume ramp. This was primarily driven by conversions from Omnipod DASH and Classic Omnipod, where we benefited from some customers getting both their starter kits and first refills in the quarter as well as some initial stocking in retail pharmacies. Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH new customer starts combined were over 95% of our total U.S. new customer starts, comprised of Omnipod 5 at over 80% and an Omnipod DASH at almost 15%. In addition, pharmacy channel volume increased to almost 75% of our total U.S. volume. International Omnipod revenue increased 9%, within our guidance range, driven by Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by ongoing AID competition. On a reported basis, foreign currency was a 1,440 basis point headwind over the prior year, which was approximately 140 basis points unfavorable versus our prior guide. During Q3, our estimated global attrition remained consistent and utilization was higher, driven by the Omnipod 5 ramp benefit mentioned. Drug Delivery revenue declined 4% and at the high end of our guidance range. Gross margin was 55.3%, representing an approximate 1,300 basis point decrease including a favorable foreign currency impact of approximately 70 basis points. Cost of revenue included a $37 million charge or approximately 1,100 basis points related to the voluntary medical device correction. The aggregate $37 million charge in Q3 primarily reflects the estimated replacement units, shipping and reclaim costs of the PDMs for global Omnipod DASH users. This charge is within the estimated $35 million to $45 million we included in our October 8-K filing. We no longer expect any material additional operating expenses to be recorded in Q4 of this year or in 2023, as we previously had estimated. Excluding the Q3 medical device correction charge, adjusted gross margin was 66.1%, representing a 240 basis point decrease. The primary drivers were the expected higher mix of costs as we ramp our U.S. manufacturing operations, higher manufacturing costs associated with Drug Delivery and higher mix of costs given Omnipod 5 ramping. These costs were partially offset by growing volume in the U.S. pharmacy channel, including the associated premium. Operating expenses were slightly higher than our expectations to support higher demand for Omnipod 5 and were higher than Q3 of last year due to continued investments in sales and marketing, such as our Omnipod 5 launch efforts, development work to advance our innovation pipeline and costs to scale our business to support our growth. Adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA in Q3, which exclude the voluntary medical device correction, were 11.6% and 18.4%, respectively. Both metrics were impacted year-over-year by gross margin pressures and an increase in operating expenses. Turning to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with over $720 million in cash and the full $70 million available under our credit facility. Our financial position remains strong and offers us the flexibility to strategically invest in our business, further strengthen our innovation pipeline and deliver growth for years to come. Now turning to 2022 guidance. We are raising our total company full year revenue growth to a range of 18% to 19%, including total Omnipod growth of 23% to 24%. For U.S. Omnipod, we are increasing our revenue range to 30% to 31%. We expect revenue growth to be driven primarily by strong Omnipod 5 new customer starts and conversions to Omnipod 5 from both Omnipod DASH and Classic Omnipod as well as increasing Omnipod DASH volume and the benefits of our pay-as-you-go business model. For international Omnipod, we are raising the low end of our full year guidance and now expect a range of 11% to 12%. On a reported basis, we estimate an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 1,200 basis points. Growth is mainly driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption partially offset by AID competitive headwinds. Lastly, for Drug Delivery, we are raising the low end of our full year guidance range and now expect a decline of 37% to 35%. As a reminder, 2021 levels were elevated as a result of the pandemic. Turning to 2022 gross margin. Excluding the impact of the voluntary medical device correction, we continue to expect a gross margin range of 65% to 66%. On a year-over-year basis, we expect our gross margin will be impacted by higher costs associated with our U.S. manufacturing ramp, product line mix due to ramping Omnipod 5 and lower drug delivery revenue. These headwinds will be partially offset by the benefit of increasing volume in the U.S. pharmacy channel. As we previously stated, we expect many of these factors to impact our results for the next couple of years. And as a result, we expect 2023 gross margin to be similar to this year. Excluding certain legal and CEO transition costs, we continue to expect operating expenses to rise year-over-year due to the investments in our sales and marketing efforts, including the launch of Omnipod 5 as well as expanding our innovation pipeline and clinical efforts and scaling our support functions. We continue to expect adjusted operating margin to be in the high single digits. And for 2023, given the expectation for gross margin and the continued investments to launch Omnipod 5 in the U.S. and international markets as well as ongoing innovation, clinical, commercial and support functions to scale the business and costs associated with our implementing a new enterprise reporting system, we expect operating margins to be similar to 2022. Our commitment to margin expansion continues, and we expect to begin to leverage this bolus of investments in 2024 and beyond. Lastly, we now expect capital expenditures to be relatively level with prior year versus our previous expectation of a slight increase. Turning to our fourth quarter 2022 revenue guidance. We expect total company growth of 11% to 14%, including total Omnipod growth of 23% to 26%. On a reported basis, we estimate an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 500 basis points. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect growth of 27% to 30%. For international Omnipod, we expect growth of 15% to 18%. On a reported basis, we estimate an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 1,600 basis points. Finally, we expect Q4 Drug Delivery revenue to be nominal as the majority of our orders for the year have already been fulfilled. In conclusion, we are delivering solid financial performance achieving critical milestones and further positioning Insulet for long-term sustainable growth. These are exciting times, given the full market release of Omnipod 5, the recent milestones we've achieved and the progress we've made advancing our innovation pipeline. We're focused on continuing to execute at a high level and delivering on our mission. With that, Dalam, please open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And I show our first question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Baird. Jeff Johnson : All right. Great, Jim. Yes, congratulations on the quarter. I guess a lot of big numbers and a lot of good numbers that we could focus on. But let me ask a question that maybe it doesn't focus on those things, and that's the charging issue you brought up maybe on Omnipod 5 that you might be seeing some early signs on. Obviously, I would think technologically, you can fix that, you can figure that out and maybe it doesn't even grow up to be any kind of real issue. But is there any risk at all, especially that your stock is going to be up tomorrow, expectations are high, given how good 05 seems to be going here. Any expectations we should have or concerns we should have that maybe 05 -- new Rxs have to pause for a little bit because of this charging issue, you have to come back and say, \"Hey, maybe 3 months from now, we'll have a fix or 2 months from now and then we can start up this 05 momentum again. Just help us understand kind of the level of risk in this charging issue. Jim Hollingshead : Sure. Thanks, Jeff. It's really early days. So let me start first and foremost with for us, patient safety is absolutely the top priority, right? And in terms of the complaints we're seeing on the charging of the Omnipod 5, it's a small number of complaints. At this point, we're looking at like a couple of dozen complaints, but we're looking at it really closely. And we don't yet have enough data to be able to understand exactly what's going on and what the risk levels are. And so we're looking at it. We're going to fully investigate it. And if we have to take any kind of action we're going to be -- as I said in the prepared comments, we're going to be really fast. We're going to be completely transparent with our customers, completely transparent with investors and obviously with the FDA, right? So I think it's too early to say, and we're looking at it really closely. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Travis Steed from Bank of America Securities. Travis Steed : Congrats on a really great quarter. I guess just to focus on -- a lot of things to ask, but to focus on the dynamic if you're talking about more to pump patients coming your way, I think you even said the word thousands. We'll have a little more color there. Do you think this is like a onetime bolus where you think people are just waiting for Omnipod 5? Or do you think this is a more sustainable trend where the 60-40 can hold? And then how that carries over to 2023. I think the Street's modeling 20% growth. I would think the U.S. could do a little better than that and OUS may be below that? Jim Hollingshead : Travis, I'll start on that, and then I'll ask the team to maybe add some color. I'll just say that Omnipod 5 is such an appealing offer. And I think the general market has been waiting for Omnipod 5. It's revolutionary. You guys all know the value prop, but wearable disposable tubeless patch pump, we competed on that form factor for a long time very successfully. Now we've added automated insulin delivery. So patients no longer have to make the choice between a patch pump and an AID pump. And that -- and you couple that with all of the access to the channel, the reimbursement access and the economics. I don't think that value prop is going to be any less appealing in Q4 or in 2023 than it is today. But I'll ask the team if they want to add color. Bret Christensen : Travis, it's Bret. So as you know, for years, we've talked about this 80-20 split where 80% of all of our new starts come from MDI. That has been our focus. It will continue to be a focus. But as Jim said, we don't have to -- or patients don't have to make that choice now between the superior form factor of Omnipod and an AID system, so they can get it all. And so it's not surprising to us the split changed from 80/20. We'll see where it settles in. We don't know yet if that -- if there's a bolus of to pump users that wanted to try Omnipod or if it's going to settle in there, it's likely to settle in somewhere different than 80-20, but we're excited to finally be offering a choice to those that chose an AID system, but really preferred the form factor of Omnipod. So we'll see where it settles in, in the coming quarters. But again, it's really an exciting development that we're getting these two pump conversions. Wayde McMillan : That's great. If I could just pick up on the question around 2023 revenue growth. And it is really, as Jim, Bret said, AID is the difference maker and that shows up in the different growth rates between the regions. For U.S., we've got a lot of momentum. Obviously, as Jim and Bret just said, and we had in the prepared remarks, we're seeing increased demand with MDI as well as conversions from our existing customers, legacy product and then the competitive switches here. So a lot of momentum in the U.S. I think the way to think about 2023 -- we'll just give some color here. We're not going to provide guidance. We'll do that in our Q4 call in February. But some color to think about at this point is U.S. carrying a lot of momentum. We should see larger dollar growth in 2023. Need to normalize that for a couple of the volume benefits we've seen here in Q2 and Q3. And that should settle us out to start right now in that low 20% growth range for the U.S. And then as you said, OUS without AID, we're thinking about really consistent. We think we'll continue to grow really well with DASH in the markets that we're in. We are bringing Omnipod 5 midyear or to start to bring it to our international markets. That rollout will continue through 2024. But where that puts us for international is high single digits, low double digits range. I think it would be a good place to start for now. And of course, both those regions we'll be monitoring here throughout Q4 and getting more confidence in some of these really dynamic metrics, as Bret just highlighted. So we get a lot of things changing pretty dynamically with Omnipod 5. So we'll monitor those see where they shake out and put our guidance in place for 2023. And then Drug Delivery, just to hit that as well. At this point, we would expect drug delivery to do about the same decline next year as it did this year. So that will put us in kind of that mid-$20 million range, about a $25 million to $30 million reduction year-over-year. That's what we're experiencing this year, and we would think about the same next year. So that sets us up for some color on 2023. But as I said, we'll provide the official guide when we get to February next year. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Robert Marcus : Yes. And congrats on a great quarter. And Wayde, thanks for the very nonspecific guide for next year. I think that will help get models in a good place. As we think about some of your competitors, they talked about lots of macro headwinds and upfront cost to the patient, and you clearly have a very different business model. But I was hoping you could just give us the latest on what you think the actual out-of-pocket is on average for patients for Omnipod in the U.S. versus MDI and basal? I don't know if it's a different price point yet and what you've disclosed there or willing to disclose. And the average monthly cost for a basal patient. And is it materially different outside the U.S. just as we think about some of the macro headwinds and headwinds some of your competitors are facing? Bret Christensen : Robbie, I can take that one. This is Bret. So as far as the macro trends in the field, we're not feeling it. We're in the midst of an Omnipod 5 launch, demand is incredibly high. The team is excited and patients are wanting to started out 2.5. I can't say that we're feeling any of the effects of a lingering COVID or any sort of macro inflationary recession-type concerns. But as you mentioned, our business model is different. And we've spent years planning a scalable, affordable business model that would allow for patients to upgrade from existing Omnipod products and start. And so we've got very low co-pays that remained below $50 on average, with the vast majority of all co-pays in the pharmacy channel being less than $5. We've said that with DASH and really the Omnipod 5 co-pays almost mirror DASH exactly where we price Omnipod 5 at parity. You've got added to the contracts with payers and pricing is very similar as far as out-of-pocket goes for our users. As far as basal-only pod, I don't know if that's the question you're asking about out-of-pocket and co-pays. We're not there yet. We'll be building reimbursement and having discussions with payers now that we've mentioned this basal-only pod. But we do have some basal usage with our existing products, primarily DASH is type 2 axis. It's very good for DASH, and they'll take DASH, they'll customize it and use it as a basal-only pump. And that reimbursement is the exact same for type 1s and type 2s for basal and for insulin intensive. So more to come on the commercialization plans of our basal-only pod, but we'll be building reimbursement next year with that product. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Margaret Kaczor : I wanted to follow up, I guess, in more detail even on that basal specific pump. What are the features that we're going to look for there? Is this a mechanical pump? Is this a smart pump? Is it going to have the closed-loop features? Is this going to be maybe in the pivotal Type 2 trial or not? Or is it going to be a separate trial together? Bret Christensen : Margaret, it's Bret. So we're excited to start to share more about the basal-only pod. Jim mentioned at the beginning of the call some of what we're excited about. And that is although we've got access today and some basal-only users will use a product like DASH, it was not built for basal-only usage. And there's a lot of complexity in pumps, and we want to take that complexity away for anybody that wants to start on a basal-only pod. So as Jim mentioned, it won't have a controller. That's very key because a lot of the complexity with pumps is around settings. There are no settings with a basal-only pod. So it's going to be designed and for the basal-only user, whether that's in endocrinology, primary care, it's focused on simplicity. And so we'll start to share more about what its form factor looks like. As Jim mentioned, we'll be submitting this product to the FDA in the coming days. And we're just excited to start educating you on what it's all about, and we'll do that in the future. But do want to highlight how excited we are to capture patients at the moment they need insulin, the moment they need an injection so they can avoid ejections altogether throughout their life on Omnipod-like products as they progress in their type 2 diabetes. Jim Hollingshead : Yes. In fact, I'll just tag on to Bret's comments. That's a key thing for us in terms of growing the TAM. We obviously -- we have the leading offer right now for patients with type 2 diabetes with Omnipod DASH, as Bret just referred to. But with the basal-only pod, we'll be getting much earlier and much further upstream into the journey of patients. And because it will be the same core Omnipod platform as a product, patients will get used to using our Omnipod product. And then as their insulin needs change, it creates the pathway for them on to our other offerings. So it's a great experience for patients. We're going to dramatically simplify the use of basal insulin for those type 2 patients. And then those customers as they progress in their therapy will have a natural pathway and/or other offerings. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : I'll echo my congratulations on a really strong quarter here. Wayde, I wanted to focus on the U.S., the $60 million, I think, in onetime items in Q3, do you expect more in. And I'm trying to reconcile, if I back that out, we, I get to about 33% growth in Q3, ex onetime items, why are you guiding to 27% to 30%, for Q4 a little bit slower. And how do we put that into the context of the 2023 color you gave, if I heard you correctly, low 20% range for U.S. Omnipod growth next year, given the Q4 guidance that you've given? Wayde McMillan : Yes. You bet, Larry. So just starting with this volume that we got -- additional volume we got around Omnipod 5. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, is some of it is timing because we only had Omnipod 5 in full market release for 2 months out of the quarter. And when people -- when some people start on Omnipod 5, as it turns out a good percentage of them ended up getting their starter kits as well as their first refill order in the quarter. So that gave us some additional volume. And then we also had some retail pharmacy stocking that is going to happen over time as more and more retail channels start to stock the product. So those are the 2 drivers of additional volume in the quarter. Your question on whether we think that will continue in Q4. We're going to monitor it very closely. We've got a lot of scenarios here of how this could play out. What we're anticipating in the guide, and that could push us either to the high end or the low end is how many of these people either wait a month to get their next script. Some people may order in the middle of the month or some people may immediately just get their next script. And so we're going to have to watch some of these dynamics and see if this volume can continue into Q4. And so just a lot to monitor, a lot of changing dynamics with Omnipod 5. We're very happy to get the volume here. At the end of the day, we are a volume business in the pharmacy channel. We're doing a lot to drive volume, both increasing access as well as all the things we're doing around innovation and awareness as well as the clinical work we're doing. You saw us announce this quarter down to H2, doing a lot of things to drive volumes here. And so we're really excited at the front end to be in the first -- just the first 2 months, and we're going to monitor this. We do think we'll get the benefit in Q4 as well. But should be somewhat offset by those people in Q3 that either take a little bit longer or take a whole month to place their next order. And then, Larry, you talked a little bit more about the Q4 guide. If you normalize for these volume benefits, then you're right, we are in about low 30s growth rate here on a normalized basis for Q2. And then as you look forward to Q4, we certainly have a much tougher comp. We had a significantly very strong quarter in Q4 last year. So we have to keep that in mind. And then, of course, we're at the front end of Omnipod 5. And so we don't want to get out in front of that. We're going to continue to monitor it, but we're really excited to see what can happen in Q4. And then as I mentioned, the key for 2023 is law of large numbers. We're planning for growing the dollar growth of the business in 2023, and that settles us out in that low 20s. And I think that's a good place to start. Again, we're not guiding. We're just trying to give some color, and we'll give our official guidance in February next year, which will give us another whole quarter here in Q4 and the start of Q1 to really understand some of these changing dynamics. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Caitlyn Cronin from Canaccord Genuity. Caitlyn Cronin : This is actually Kyle on here. The one question I wanted to talk about was specifically moving into more of a type 2 focus. I mean, obviously, you have a business now. We've seen some of your other diabetes technology partners when they've gone more meaningfully into the basal market, they made some commercial changes or a commercial shift in focus, adding salespeople, things of that sort. Just Bret, I wondered how we should think about the state of the sales force now with respect to the type 2 market and maybe the investments you'll need to make over the course of the next 12 to 24 months when you bring the basal-only and then eventually an AID for type 2? Bret Christensen : Kyle, thanks for the question. So we've got a really strong type 2 offering today, as you know, with access that mirrors type 1 in the pharmacy channel. So start there. Got a really good product with DASH. It's got an indication for all insulin requiring patients, great coverage. We're going to add to that offering with getting an indication for Omnipod 5 as we've started that trial, that clinical. And we're going to add the basal-only pod in 2024. And we think what that does for us is it does allow us to capture patients at the moment they need insulin. It's too early to say what the commercial model will look like for that product. But we know we can capture some of it today with just the existing sales force and team that we have as many of those patients do reside in endocrinology and we do call on a small number of primary care physicians with the existing sales teams. So more to come there. I think it does just depend on how quickly we can build reimbursement, how quickly that launch goes and then how we start to think about primary care and capturing patients where they reside. But we'll talk more about that probably later in 2023. There's a lot to consider there. It's really exciting. It more than doubles our TAM, with more than 3 million patients in the U.S. that are basal-only. So we're excited about it, and there's a lot to consider as far as how we commercialize it in 2024. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. Jayson Bedford : Just 2 questions that require quick answers. On the '23 guidance, just kidding, Wayde. I know it's not guidance, but just what's the expected FX impact on revenue? And then second, on the basal-only pod, you mentioned submitting in the next few days, but I think your commercialization not until '24. So one, I just want to know, is it a 510(k)? And second, why the big gap between selling and commercialization? Wayde McMillan : Eric, you bet. Happy to talk about the '23 color that we're providing to help everyone here before we get the guidance, Jayson, that's on a constant currency basis. And so obviously, not going to be factoring in where we think FX is going to go at this point. So just think about the color there on a constant currency basis and then I don't know if you want to talk to Basel, to Jim Hollingshead : So on Basel, yes, it is a 510(k). we were submitting it imminently. Just a couple o. We don't want to get out in front of time lines on approvals. So we don't want -- don't want do that publicly. We'll let you guys know as we get approval and what we're going to do. And then as Bret was saying, there's work to be done on the commercialization plan. And I think the reason for that is it's a new-to-world offer. It's not a new pod. It's an Omnipod platform built on our core offering. But the patient set is new, the channel might be new. The call points might include new call points. There's just a lot to consider in the commercial offering that we need to work through. And so we don't want to jump the gun on talking about these things until we have more certainty. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Steve Lichtman from Oppenheimer. Steve Lichtman : Just a couple of quick follow-ups. One, can you give any more color on timing of iOS? And two, relative to basal-only, I apologize if you mentioned this, but do you anticipate that being a lower COGS device given maybe a different price point as you go into that channel? Jim Hollingshead : So we'll start with IOS, the iOS, that work is proceeding, as we said last quarter, we're really confident in what we're building there. Our teams have tested it. We've had it out of testing on sample customers. And we'll give you more update as we get closer. That's another one I don't want to jump the gun on and it's our practice to not talk about those dates until they're right in our hands. And so but we're very confident that our iOS offering is going to be very strong, And we want to get it to market as quickly as we can. On the basal pod, I'll just say that -- maybe you can -- maybe the guys can remind me of the question Wayde McMillan : Sure. On the pricing and pricing, which we're not. Jim Hollingshead : We're not ready to talk about pricing. I will say about the basal pod is that because it's based on our core Omnipod platform, it has all the same IP wrapped into it all the same IP protection. What's different about it is that it's basal-only. And so it doesn't take a controller. It has a basal rate built into it. It makes it really simple for -- just to give you some color to what we're picturing here. It's because it's the Omnipod with the auto insertion, it's really easy to put on anybody has a needle phobia. Look, I'm needle phobic, right? And I warn the Omnipod, I can't fill go in. And that's what we're going for here. Is anybody that is on basal-only therapy and has to do daily or with the injections who has needle phobia doesn't really want to do that. And the beauty of this basal-only pod is it's going to make that insertion really easy and then allow the customer to get their basal rate on a continuous basis over 72 hours. It's very disruptive -- and it's -- we think it's going to be an extremely simple experience and really change and potentially lift should have a huge benefit to their care and a huge potential benefit to payers. But there's a lot to be worked through. So we're not going to talk about pricing. We're not going to talk about COGS and those things. We'll give you guys more detail as we get closer. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale from Nephron Research. Chris Pasquale : Couple of more questions about the basal pod. It sounds like a very exciting opportunity. First, what percentage of basal patients have reimbursement coverage for Omnipod today? Are you going to be able to piggyback on that or you have to start from scratch with the new product? And then second, there's obviously a lot of focus on CGM adoption in this population. Is there any potential benefit to having the Pod and the CGM sensor talk to each other in this population, these patients need to titrate insulin rates as their disease progresses or anything like that? Because it sounds like what you're talking about here is more the B featured offering. Bret Christensen : Yes. Chris, great question. The reimbursement today for basal-only patients, the answer to that is there really is no difference between insulin-intensive type 2 patients and basal patients as far as reimbursement goes. However, Omnipod was not built with basal only in mind. And so while there are some patients using it for basal only, just wasn't really built that way. And again, there's complexity with PDMs, there's complexities with settings. And so if you're going to use a product like DASH today, although it's reimbursed, you effectively have to kind of program DASH to say, look, we're going to get rid of all the mealtime features, a lot of the features and just use it as a basal-only product. So not ideal for basal-only wasn't built that way. It does seem complex some to like a primary care physician, that simply wants to write a prescription, which is what they would do with basal-only pod. And so while the reimbursement is there, we plan on changing it because it will be a different code. And so it will be a different reimbursed rate at a different price. We just haven't -- we're just not ready to talk about that. We've got work to do before we get confident in talking about what that will be, what we'll contract for. As far as the CGM goes, that's a lift for us because, as you know, CGMs provide the user with tremendous information that requires them to act. It shows physicians' time and range. And that's going to be really valuable for driving demand for a product like basal-only pod, but our initial thinking is we really don't want those 2 products to speak to each other because it does add complexity as you mentioned. And so the thought on basal-only pod to keep it as simple as possible as featured as possible. We want a position to write a prescription and that really is it. And so that means no communication with no reports, no settings. That's what we're thinking about today. And we think that's the best way to go broad and capture that marketplace. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien from Piper Sandler. I show our next question comes from the line of Marie Thibault from BTIG. Marie Thibault : In your comments, you mentioned that current Omnipod users are converting to Omnipod 5 at a much higher than previous launches. I'm just curious what portion of that installed base has converted at this point? And what portion you think could eventually convert over time? And congrats on the great quarter. Wayde McMillan : Marie, it's Wayde. I can start that one, and then I'm sure Bret or Jim might want to jump in. So given that we're just in the first couple of months of our full market release, we are just getting started here. So we have seen -- just like in all the channels, we mentioned the competitive switches as well as MDI conversions of existing Omnipodders has also been incredibly strong even just in the first few months and tracking them through their journey coming to Omnipod 5. So the way we're thinking about this right now is if we continue to see accelerated rates of conversion -- converting customers, it will probably last throughout 2023. And the majority of them should be through in 2023. But again, in the first couple of months here, we're going to be watching this as we are with many of these different dynamics to these really strong converting trends continue after the first couple of months or do they ebb and flow over the next few years. But if we continue with these trends, we should have most customers converted by the end of 2023. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien from Piper Sandler. Matthew O'Brien: Okay. Great. So I would love to kind of follow up a little bit on, I think what Marie was talking about as well, but more on the competitive pump side of things because that was really new information and the shift so quickly is kind of startling. So is it a function of the more legacy provider in the space that you're really being successful? Is it both of the big players there? And then can you talk about how that momentum has built or built throughout the quarter? And your thoughts on continuing to drive into a competitive pump share over the next several quarters and years. . Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Matt. Look, I think as we said earlier in the call, customers no longer need to choose. So a number of customers have forever been drawn to the great simplicity and elegance and ease of use of the pod form factor. And with Omnipod 5, we're offering a fantastic AID algorithm. And so to get AID therapy and the preferred form factor, to get into the channel they want, to get it with the economics they want. And so it's actually not surprising to us to see a number of people switch from tubed pump offerings. The offering is just so easy to use and it delivers great clinical outcomes, incredible ease of use and great economics. And so we've had -- we were pleased to see the rate of switching in the quarter. In terms of forward look, I think we're going to have to wait and see how it plays out. But as I said earlier, I don't think that this -- the Omnipod 5 offering will become any less appealing either to customers coming from MDI or to customers who might be using the tooth pump who went there because they wanted an AID offer. So we're very confident in the robustness of the offer. Operator : And I show our next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor from Jefferies. Unidentified Analyst : I guess there's been a lot of questions on the U.S., which is looking great. I wanted to ask an international one. You mentioned a few catalysts there, obviously, the CE Mark, but some evidence development that's going on there as well to expand coverage. I was just hoping you could kind of frame how you expect those kind of things to help your international growth next year and going forward? Jim Hollingshead : So on international, there's a number of things going on. We're very pleased to get the CE Mark. So that's no longer a hurdle we have to get over. We have CE Mark, and that's good to go for Omnipod 5. As we've said before, what we're working on now in terms of Omnipod 5 launch is making sure that we have the right cloud infrastructure that delivers the right. If you think about the Omnipod 5 offering, it's a very holistic offering for customers. So we want to make sure that we're delivering the full Omnipod 5 experience in the markets where we launch. And we also obviously have to be comporting both with European and with any local market data privacy and security regulations. And so that's work that's being built. We don't need the RCT that we talk about to do that. So we'll be -- if I could just go back for a second to Omnipod 5 ex U.S., as we've said, we'll be launching in Europe in the middle of '23 and then we'll stage those launches to make sure that we have the right launch plan for each market as we cascade the second half of '23 into '24 and launch those markets. The randomized controlled trial is designed to make sure that we have the right kind of clinical evidence to position Omnipod 5 appropriately in ex U.S. markets. And so we're confident that we're going to be able to demonstrate benefit of our AID algorithm and the pod form factor against non-AID pumps and CGM alone. And that's where we're building evidence, which is a huge effort for us or a huge -- it's a huge emphasis for us to continue to build evidence for Omnipod 5. Operator : And I show our last question in the queue comes from the line of Matt Miksic from Barclays. Matt Miksic : And congrats on a really strong quarter. Just maybe a couple of comments -- questions around color on sort of tubeless and [indiscernible]. If you could maybe elaborate on your expectations for what percentage of people with diabetes in the U.S. historically had been selecting tubeless pump -- your pump essentially in the past? And if you think that's changing and why? And then maybe just some color as to if the mix of your patient is changing in terms of age or folks coming in as staying or returning after leaving that kind of color would be super helpful. And congrats again. Bret Christensen : Matt, thanks for the question. So as we sort of highlighted, we are the leader in driving penetration from MDI, and that has always been our focus. So the bulk of our new starts. And for us, a new start is the first time you start on an Omnipod product. We don't count renewals. We don't count other shipments. If you start on Omnipod, new start once in your lifetime. And our focus has always been MDI, and that's where the 80-20 number has come from, where 80% of those new starts have come from MDI. This quarter, we did see that shift where only 60% came from MDI because we had a bolus of people coming from 2 pumps that we hope continues. And the other -- we've also been the leader in pediatrics. I think you're kind of asking about where our customers come from. Pediatrics has always been our strength. If you think about the form factor of Omnipod 5, very attractive to parents and to children. We lost a little bit with the lack of an AID system where parents were actually forced again to make that decision between the form factor that's perfect for pediatrics and an AID system. Now they don't have to make that. So we did see a lift, a significant lift in pediatrics as a percentage of our new starts this past quarter. We're excited about that. Those are patients that are newly diagnosed that we want to start on Omnipod and want them to use our products for life. So excited about that trend, excited to be beginning to get competitive to pump users. And I think you asked sort of about people coming back. And as Jim highlighted at the beginning of the call, we did see thousands of people this past quarter have come back to Omnipod. So they left us for a reason. Likely that was an AID reason and the lack of. And so with Omnipod 5, they're coming back to that product. We've seen attrition be very stable, and we're excited about what Omnipod 5 does to strengthen retention with our existing users. Operator : Thank you. I'm showing no further questions in the queue. This concludes our Q&A session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to Jim Hollingshead, President and Chief Executive Officer, for closing remarks. Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Dalam, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. These are incredibly exciting times at Insulet as Omnipod 5 is out in the market transforming diabetes management for thousands of people, and that number keeps growing. And we could not be more excited to further expand our addressable market with our new innovation in Type 2 for the type 2 community with our basal-only pod. We've got an incredible team, and with significant momentum and to continue to execute on our mission. Thank you, and have a great evening. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Insulet Corporation Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations. Deborah Gordon : Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Insulet's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Call. With me today are Jim Hollingshead, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Wayde McMillan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bret Christensen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, is also with us for the Q&A portion of our call. Both the replay of this call and the press release discussing our 2022 fourth quarter and full year results and 2023 guidance will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Before we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such statements. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating margin, adjusted EBITDA and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. These measures align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance, and we believe they are helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties as measures of our operating performance from period to period. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis with the exception of revenue growth rates, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim. Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. In Q4, the global Insulet team delivered another record quarter of growth, which was a strong end cap to a remarkable 2022. We exceeded our expectations once again, achieving revenue growth of 45% in the U.S. and over 35% for total Omnipod and our U.S. and global new customer starts were at record levels. And 2022 marked our seventh consecutive year of 20-plus percent revenue growth. This past year, we not only drove consistently strong financial performance, we also achieved a number of critical milestones. We now have roughly 360,000 active global customers on the Omnipod platform, including more than 100,000 customers on Omnipod 5. In fact, during Q4, Omnipod 5 represented over 90% of our U.S. new customer starts. This transformative technology is the leading offer in the market and is proving to be the obvious choice for consumers. The 2022 full market release of our Omnipod 5 automated insulin delivery system was a huge achievement. This is the product our company was founded to make. And we continue to build on that momentum throughout the year, adding CE Mark approval and quickly extending our label in the U.S. to include pediatric customers down to age 2 for Omnipod 5, as well as completing the 510(k) submission for our type 2 basal-only pod. During 2022, we also further strengthened our intellectual property mode representing a culmination of work throughout the year that should protect our innovation capabilities and opportunities for years to come. And we made notable advancements in our clinical efforts, including the recent publication of our first look at real-world evidence for Omnipod 5. I'll speak in more detail about the highlights of these accomplishments in a few minutes. I could not be more proud of everything the Insulet team has achieved in advancing our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes. And on top of everything we've achieved during 2022, I am confident our best is yet to come. Omnipod 5 is truly unmatched as an AID system. With Omnipod 5, we have delivered a number of market firsts -- it's the only tubeless waterproof pod-based AID system and the first to offer full compatible smartphone control with constant cloud-based connectivity -- this means doctors don't have to wait for data to be uploaded when or if a patient visits a physician. With Omnipod 5, customers no longer need to plug in their devices to access their data. Our smart bolus calculator helps patients manage their blood glucose levels and trends, and there are no other AID systems that include the adaptive algorithm that Omnipod 5 has. It works right out of the box and learns each customer's specific usage and then predict their trends and automatically personalizes their care. These all are competitive advantages that significantly improve and simplify diabetes management. Omnipod 5 continues to drive customer adoption from all market segments. MDI users are growing at the high end of our forecast as are those switching from competitive tube pumps. And the number of current Omnipod customer conversions are exceeding our expectations. In Q4, the percentage of customers coming from MDI and traditional tube pumps was an estimated 65-35 split compared to our historical 80-20 mix due to significantly more competitive switches. This again speaks to the value Omnipod 5 brings to MDI and traditional tube pump users. We also continue to win back thousands of customers who had once been potters and returned to us in Q4 to adopt Omnipod 5. Adopters are coming from all age groups. Due to higher-than-expected demand for Omnipod 5, we increased investments in our support capabilities, primarily within our call centers. These investments have helped drive our customer and product support experience back to historical levels of excellence. This has included taking quick action to address certain complaints regarding the Omnipod DASH and Omnipod 5 handheld devices. We previously announced the medical device correction for Omnipod 5 due to an issue with the controller charging port in cable. The FDA subsequently classified this as a Class 2 correction, and we are in the process of providing replacements to our customers upon request. With respect to the previously announced Omnipod DASH MDC, we expect to complete the replacement of personal diabetes managers within the coming months. I am proud of our global team's focus to ensure these corrective actions were executed with a sense of urgency and care. Consumer-focused innovation is central to everything we do. Omnipod 5 was designed with the user 100% in mind, and the results and feedback we receive speak to our shared success. One recent story from a mother of an 8-year-old with diabetes was particularly touching. She said, \" Omnipod 5 has given me my life back. I sleep through the night. I feel like me again. Diabetes has moved from the foreground to the background in our daily lives. This speaks to the power of Omnipod 5 and supports why we designed the product and the customer experience the way we did.  A critical element to our continued strong Omnipod growth is an unwavering commitment to expand access and awareness, and we're doing this through multiple initiatives. First is through our growing presence in the U.S. pharmacy channel. With low co-pays and broad coverage, access to Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH is affordable and simpler, which helps drive adoption and makes Omnipod more attractive and accessible, especially during challenging economic times. Second, we priced Omnipod 5 at parity with Omnipod DASH, resulting in our ability to meaningfully expand commercial coverage for Omnipod 5. By year-end, coverage approached 90% of U.S. lives. Additionally, because the vast majority of our U.S. customers pay less than $50 a month through the pharmacy channel, the cost is similar to multiple daily injections, even though our technology offers improved outcomes, glycemic control and quality of life. Our annuity business model and pharmacy access also benefit physicians and payers.  We have eliminated large upfront costs and lengthy lock-in periods. This offers real value to payers compared to traditional tubed pumps sold through the durable medical equipment channel. This is especially true when you consider that on average, individuals in the U.S. change insurance plans every couple of years. I also want to share that we recently notified U.S. classic Omnipod customers about our plans to phase out that technology by the end of this year since the vast majority of our customer base no longer is on our legacy product. We value every classic Omnipod customer and will help them through their transition to either Omnipod 5 or Omnipod DASH. 2022 also was another exciting year for Insulet in terms of advancing our clinical efforts, and that momentum is carrying into 2023. We recently finalized our type 2 pivotal study protocol with the FDA and received IDE approval. We plan to begin enrollment in the 3-month study in the coming weeks. This will be the largest clinical study we've conducted to date and rolling up to 350 people with type 2 diabetes from 20 sites across the U.S. There will be a targeted focus to recruit diverse and underserved populations to demonstrate safety and efficacy of Omnipod 5. Omnipod 5 also opens up new avenues for clinical evidence. Yesterday, at ATTD, we shared the first release of real-world evidence for Omnipod 5 with data from more than 31,000 people using the system for at least 3 months. This kind of data is unmatched by competitors and gives us valuable insights into how people use the product and the outcomes they're achieving. We're able to see which device settings contribute to maximum time in range and minimal hypoglycemia. The data demonstrated glycemic results in line with those observed in our pivotal trials and also reinforced the benefits of our customizable target glucose settings. These are some of the reasons why Omnipod 5 will be a market leader for years to come. Our enthusiasm is shared by a health care practitioner who recently said the Omnipod 5 real-world data set is striking and that it includes all users since everyone is connected to the cloud-based system. With this large sample and limited selection bias, we see strong time in target range and minimal time below range exceeding glycemic targets on average. This is extremely promising for long-term benefit in the real world. Our real-world data for Omnipod 5 will be incredibly powerful over time since every user is cloud connected. For patients, this means we can continue to personalize and improve the overall experience. For physicians, this means we will be able to streamline their workflows. Over time, our intention is to tie that usage data to claims data to further drive Omnipod 5 adoption as well as build a host of other enhancements such as population-based health management for payers. Nobody else in diabetes therapy can create evidence from data that includes all patients on therapy. This means that we will have unprecedented insights into actual population level usage patterns, which will allow us to constantly improve our offerings and build on our already market-leading product differentiation. While we are thrilled with the market response to Omnipod 5, winning in the global diabetes market requires a commitment to innovation. Today, we have a strong innovation pipeline that includes our type 2 basal-only pod, future AID offerings and digital and data capabilities. Today, our unique form factor and access model are helping us win in the type 2 population in addition to type 1. We deliver a market-leading experience. And as a result, in Q4, individuals with type 2 represented an estimated 15% to 20% of our new U.S. customer starts. We expect to build on our leading competitive position in this market as well as expand our total addressable market with the planned 2024 commercialization of our new basal-only pod. This will be a unique product for the type 2 market and will provide us with early entry into the treatment experience and help patients become comfortable with the Omnipod on-body experience. We believe this innovation will offer users a clear pathway to adopt Omnipod 5 as their insulin needs progress. We estimate the total addressable market for our basal-only pod is approximately 3 million people in the U.S. alone, doubling our U.S. TAM. We are also making great headway in our development work to integrate Omnipod 5 with DexCom's G7 and Abbott's Libre systems, and our iOS integration efforts continue to progress very well. We offer the best AID system on the market today and our future generations of technology, including CGM of choice, will continue to strengthen our leading value proposition. To continue to deliver our unique and leading technologies, a key priority for us is our intellectual property. We have significantly expanded our patent portfolio over the last few years. And in this past year, we more than doubled it both organically and through record patent filings and an acquisition. We acquired the pump and AID patent portfolio of Bigfoot Biomedical, including approximately 400 patents and a large number of global patent applications. Over many years, Big Food has developed a strong patent library covering areas such as closed loop technology, smartphone control, secure communications and improved user experience innovations. Our acquisition of these patent assets add significant strength to our overall intellectual property portfolio. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, we entered into a mutual agreement with Medtronic not to assert our patents at each other for certain diabetes technologies. With certain exclusions, this agreement applies to both companies' existing products as well as new products commercialized over the next 7 years and does not permit cloning each other's products. The agreement replaces an earlier one and provides more certainty around covered products and the agreement's duration. Through these efforts, we have created a broad and deep IP moat that positions us incredibly well to build upon our current leading innovative platform and continue to grow our expanding innovation pipeline. Moving on to our international operations. We had a solid year of double-digit revenue growth, even with the ongoing impact of AID competition. We expect to begin to offset those headwinds in 2023 with the launch of Omnipod 5 in the U.K. midyear and in Germany towards the end of this year, marking the beginning of our staged international rollout. We plan to launch Omnipod 5 more broadly internationally during 2024. Lastly, our global manufacturing capabilities continue to support our long-term growth trajectory and serve as another competitive moat. While macro conditions remain challenging, we continue to support our growing global customer base and the strong demand for Omnipod 5. Our operations team has worked tirelessly to secure components and build products ahead of our forecasted demand. We remain committed to providing uninterrupted supply and the highest quality product to all our global customers. In closing, the fourth quarter marked a terrific end to a remarkable year of strong financial performance and operational achievements. We have so many exciting opportunities in the years ahead, and the entire Insulet team remains committed to executing our mission and strengthening our long-term growth trajectory.  I will now turn the call over to Wayde. Wayde McMillan : Thanks, Jim. 2022 was an exciting year with the U.S. launch of Omnipod 5 and the fourth quarter was no exception. We once again delivered strong financial results while advancing our mission. In Q4, we generated 23% revenue growth, fishing above the high end of our guidance range, driven by total Omnipod growth of 36%.  On a reported basis, for total revenue, foreign currency was a 250 basis point headwind compared to Q4 of last year. U.S. Omnipod revenue growth was 45%, exceeding our guidance range. Revenue growth continues to be driven by our annuity-based model with cumulative record new customer starts and growing U.S. pharmacy volume. This includes an increasing contribution from Omnipod 5 and a premium for the Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH pods. Growth in the quarter included an estimated $15 million net volume benefit associated with the Omnipod 5 volume ramp. This was driven primarily by new Omnipod 5 customers including conversions from Omnipod DASH and Classic Omnipod, where we again benefited from some customers simultaneously getting both their starter kits and first order of refills as well as some initial stocking in retail pharmacies. This benefit was partially offset by some Omnipod 5 customers skipping a refill as a result of this dynamic. This volume benefit primarily from conversions will create a tougher comparison in future years as we expect most existing customers to switch to Omnipod 5 in 2023. During Q4, Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH new customer starts combined were 100% of our total U.S. new customer starts. This is an important milestone in our transition to pharmacy as all Omnipod 5 coverage is through the pharmacy channel and is the majority -- as is the majority of Omnipod DASH. As a result, our pharmacy channel volume increased to approximately 80% of our total U.S. volume in the fourth quarter. International Omnipod revenue increased 19% in Q4, above our guidance range driven by Omnipod DASH adoption. On a reported basis, foreign currency was a 13-point headwind over the prior year, which was approximately 3 points favorable versus our guide. As a reminder, our revenue in Q4 of the prior year was impacted by an unfavorable $5 million channel inventory reduction creating an easier comparison. During Q4, our estimated global attrition and utilization trends remain consistent with prior years with higher utilization in Q4. Note, we estimated higher utilization in Q3 above historic trends with the volume benefit of the initial Omnipod 5 ramp. Historically, our U.S. utilization has been highest in the fourth quarter of the year. Drug Delivery revenue declined 90% and slightly better than our guidance range. Gross margin was 58.8%, representing an approximate 10-point decrease, including a favorable foreign currency impact of approximately 50 basis points. Cost of revenue included a $21 million net charge or approximately 570 basis points associated with the voluntary medical device correction. This net charge was comprised of $27 million related to our previously announced Omnipod 5 MDC, partially offset by a $6 million benefit due to a revised estimated costs associated with the Omnipod DASH MDC. Excluding the Q4 MDC net charge, adjusted gross margin was 64.5%, representing a 480 basis point decrease in line with our expectations. Our growing volume in the U.S. pharmacy channel including the associated premium positively contributed to gross margin. This was more than offset by expected higher mix of costs due to the ramping of Omnipod 5 and our U.S. manufacturing operations as well as unfavorable mix from lower drug delivery revenue and a charge associated with the phaseout of classic Omnipod. Operating expenses were above our expectations to support continued higher sales performance and were higher than Q4 of last year as we further invest in our business. Adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA and in Q4 were 11.5% and 19.3%, respectively. Both exclude the voluntary medical device correction net charge and a $2 million benefit related to a legal settlement adjustment. Both metrics were impacted year-over-year by gross margin pressures and an increase in operating expenses. Turning to full year results. We delivered total Omnipod revenue growth of 27% and total company revenue growth of 22%, which reflects the incredible demand for Omnipod 5 ongoing contribution from Omnipod DASH throughout our global markets and the benefit of our annuity-based business model. On a reported basis, foreign currency was unfavorable over the prior year by 360 basis points. In 2022, we achieved adjusted gross margin of 66.2%, down 220 basis points and in line with our expectations. Adjusted operating margin was 9.5%, down 200 basis points. and adjusted EBITDA margin was 17.2%, down 240 basis points. Both metrics were impacted year-over-year by gross margin pressures and an increase in operating expenses and were slightly higher than our expectations due to our revenue outperformance. Turning to cash and liquidity. We ended the year with $675 million in cash. In addition, during Q4, we further strengthened our financial position by increasing our available borrowings under our credit agreement to $100 million. We remain in a solid position to continue investing in our business. Now turning to our 2023 outlook. For the full year, we expect total Omnipod revenue growth of 17% to 22% and total company revenue growth of 14% to 19%. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect revenue growth of 21% to 26%, driven by strong Omnipod 5 adoption coming from both new customer starts, and conversions from another Omnipod product as well as the continued adoption of Omnipod DASH and the benefits of our pay-as-you-go business model. We currently expect the cadence of our revenue growth to be more weighted to the first half of the year, given a tougher comparison in the second half of the year, resulting from the Omnipod 5 full market release in the U.S. in August of 2022. This includes the related volume benefit from the accelerated pace of customer conversions in the second half of 2022. For international Omnipod, we expect revenue growth of 6% to 10%. On a reported basis, we estimate a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of approximately 100 basis points. Growth is mainly driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by AID competitive headwinds. We -- while we're excited to introduce Omnipod 5 to our first international markets later this year, given our annuity model, we are not expecting a material contribution to growth in our international markets for Omnipod 5 in 2023. Lastly, for drug delivery in 2023, we expect a decline of 55% to 45%, representing a $1 decline similar to what we experienced in 2022. Turning to 2023 gross margin. We expect a gross margin range of 65% to 66%, consistent with 2022 at the high end. We expect a favorable impact from the benefit of increasing volume in the U.S. pharmacy channel and favorable geographical sales mix. These tailwinds are expected to be more than offset by inflation higher costs associated with our U.S. manufacturing ramp and product line mix due to increasing Omnipod 5 volume. As we previously stated, we expect many of these factors to impact our results into 2024. We expect gross margin in the first half of the year to be near the lower end of the range and the second half of the year to be closer to the high end of the range. This improvement will be driven by increasing sales volume, improving manufacturing performance, and timing of the additional costs associated with the Omnipod DASH and Omnipod 5 medical device corrections. We expect operating expenses to rise due to investments in our sales and marketing efforts including the phased launch of Omnipod 5 in our international markets as well as expanding our innovation pipeline and clinical efforts and scaling our support functions. We expect operating margin to be in the high single digits, similar to 2022 levels with significant improvement in the second half of the year over the first half due to timing of investments and improved second half gross margins. We remain committed to margin expansion, and we expect to begin to leverage this bolus of investments in 2024 and beyond. For capital expenditures, we expect a lower level than 2022 as we begin to leverage our investments, building capacity to date. Turning to our first quarter 2023 revenue guidance. We expect total Omnipod growth of 22% to 25% and total company growth of 11% to 14%. On a reported basis, we estimate an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 200 basis points. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect growth of 33% to 36%. We expect the core drivers of growth to be the ongoing adoption of Omnipod 5, including the benefits of the U.S. pharmacy channel and our consistent record new customer starts as well as our annuity model. For international Omnipod, we expect growth of 4% to 7%, driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by AID competitive headwinds and and estimated order timing. On a reported basis, we estimate an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 600 basis points. Finally, we expect Q1 drug delivery revenue to be nominal based on the current production schedule. In conclusion, we delivered a strong finish in the fourth quarter and another year of solid financial performance. We achieved many milestones and entered 2023 with a clear strategic focus and momentum in our business. We're incredibly excited about the year ahead and what is to come for our customers and our shareholders as we further execute our global mission.  With that, operator, please open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robbie Marcus from JP Morgan. Robbie Marcus : Great. Well, first off, congrats on a really nice quarter, impressive work. Maybe for my question, I'll ask on new patient growth. By my math, it looks like you're somewhere in the low 30% year-over-year with a much better second half versus first half. It's great to see that competitive switches are becoming part of the equation. All age groups, 100% in pharmacy. It's you're basically taking off all the right boxes. I guess the question is, how sustainable do you think this trend is? Do you think it's a bit of early adopters or new converters? Or do you think this is the start of a longer duration, multiyear trend where Insulet can start to shift towards market leader in terms of new patients and overall market share? Jim Hollingshead : I'll start with that, Robbie, it's Jim. Thanks for your congrats, by the way. I'll start and then either way or Brent might want to add color -- we're very bullish on Omnipod 5. There's -- obviously, we're so strong out of the gate here. And as Wayde talked about in his prepared remarks, and we talked about last quarter, there are some things going on here with starter kits, and so it's hard for us to get a quantitative trend. But in terms of the nature of demand, we think it's really strong, and we're really bullish. Omnipod 5 is going to be such a revolutionary offer -- it's such a great experience for customers is delivering such great results that we think demand will continue to persist for the long -- not just through '23, but for the long haul. But I'll invite Bret or way Bret and Wayde to comment. Wayde McMillan : Sure, Jim. I can jump in. Robbie, it is, as Jim said, a really strong start here in our first 5 reported months with Omnipod 5 in this new platform. And so we think it's very sustainable. As Jim said, we have a significant innovation pipeline to come yet. We'll be bringing, as you know, iOS integration with G7, Libre. We just got the type 2 indication -- pardon me, the Type 2 trial finalized with the FDA, and so we'll be pursuing an indication for type 2 for Omnipod 5 as well. So we're just going to layer in a lot more innovations over time. So that gives us confidence that the platform will continue to grow. Having said that, as Jim called out in our prepared remarks, a big driver of our current growth rate is our converting customers, moving from the DME into the pharmacy channel. So that's what we called out in the prepared remarks that will create a bit of a tougher comp for us next year. So the new converters, obviously, as our current customers, classic Omnipod and DASH customers convert Omnipod 5, and we're assuming most of them will be done by the end of 2023. That's the piece that won't be as sustainable because once they convert, they're done. But the rest of the business just doing incredibly well. record new customer starts, as Jim said, from MDI from competitive switches. And so we do think we're at the front edge of a very long multiyear growth cycle. Bret Christensen : Ravi, I'll just pile on to since you asked about new starts. MDI is probably the biggest indicator of it. So is waiting Jim Bill said record MDI, record competitive conversions, record overall new starts. The MDIs, we think, is absolutely sustainable. But also, remember, we were still optimizing things in Q4. There were some speed bumps with the onboarding process. access was not maximized, but did get to 90%, which mirrored our our new starts for the quarter. And then we are just really starting to promote Omnipod 5 in earnest, and you'll see some DTC rolling out. So from my standpoint, I think MDI growth can absolutely sustain throughout the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Baird. Jeff Johnson : Congratulations on the quarter. Just wanted to ask a question, I guess, on the international launch of Omnipod 5. Obviously, we've now got a couple of markets that we know is coming into here in the second half of this year. Jim, maybe you can just level set us again. I know there's some stricter restrictions on the warranty periods in some of these markets. You're going to have to pursue reimbursement in some of these markets. There's cloud-based data regulations, you're waiting their way through. But I'm going to tell you, I mean over here at ATTD, it was helpable yesterday, the interest in 05 to the point that I was a little worried for Dr. Li with some of the feedback from some of the doctors just on how much they were battling to get her to commit to launching 05 sooner in a lot of these countries in that. I mean there is true interest as you guys, I'm sure, well know. So how fast can new patients start MDI win competitive converts, those kind of things ramp in the international markets relative to what we've seen so strong here out of the gate in the U.S. Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Jeff. We know there's a lot of pent demand for Omnipod 5 and just tons of interest. And actually, we talked to Train we knew -- we heard a little bit about the pressure she was under in the session. And obviously, we want to get Omnipod 5 into every market we can as fast as we can. It's both because it's a great growth opportunity for us, but really because it's such a benefit to customers. And -- we know just the things we see here in the U.S. feedback we're getting from customers; it's changing people's lives. It's such a great experience. It's so simple to use. So we want to move just as fast as we can, first thing. We have announced that we're going to do the U.K. in the middle of the year in Germany by the end of the year. There's a bunch of reasons for that. They're both obviously large and important markets. There are some things we can do to execute there a little more quickly we're working really hard in the background to be able to -- to continue to get into markets as quickly as we can. And we want to be able to reach all those patients. And obviously, it's in our interest to do it, but it's really -- we need to get to those patients and help them. It's really exciting. Every market, I think specific to your question, every market has a little bit of a different set of regulations around once people have been put on a pump or when can they switch and that sort of thing. I think as a general rule, with the caveat that every market is a little different. As a general rule, it won't be as easy to get on to Omnipod 5 for an existing tube pump user as it is in the U.S. because in the U.S., obviously, we have the pharmacy channel benefit. We're in a different category of reimbursement, so people can switch over to pharmacy reimbursement and get on Omnipod 5, they can use our free trial. That ability to switch has been a huge growth driver for us in the U.S. And in a lot of the European markets, it will be a little bit stickier. But those markets are still really under-penetrated. And the standard patient in all of those European markets is still an MDI. And so there are a bunch of people who are self-injecting who are waiting for the innovation to come. And it's just really exciting for us. We want to move as fast as we can. And when we get into market, as Wayde said, we have to guide a little bit. We have to be a little bit cautious about how we got on things like revenue because our model is somebody converts to Omnipod 5. And then as you know, there's an annuity ramp. So the revenue builds as people get on product and then they use pods. And so we have to be a little bit mindful of how we guide on the revenue impact, but we think there's really important underpenetrated markets across all of the markets we're in. and we're moving just as fast as we can to meet that need. Operator : Our next question comes from Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. Jayson Bedford : Congrats. Maybe just a simple question here, just looking at the volume and the revenue growth. Volume through the pharmacy, is there a ceiling to that number? Where can that go? Bret Christensen : Jayson, I'll take that one. This is Bret. It's -- there could be, but it's not in the same way that you might see with other companies because remember, we do have a Part D indication from CMS, which means all of our Medicare business goes through the pharmacy channel. Medicaid business goes through the pharmacy channel. All Omnipod 5 business goes to the pharmacy channel. So really, there's not a ceiling, except for the fact that we do still have DME contracts with our legacy product which, of course, we announced we will phase out at the end of the year and then a little bit with DASH. But outside of that, if you just look past those products with Omnipod 5 and beyond, there really is not a ceiling to the volume that we get it in the pharmacy channel is all of Omnipod 5 will go through the pharmacy channel and all Medicare, Medicaid. So we're going to be much higher than I think most companies in diabetes don't know if we'll ever get to 100%, but don't see a ceiling that prevents us from getting there. Operator : Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : Congratulations on a really strong quarter here. I wanted to shift gears and ask about the basal-only pod. You've submitted the 510(k). When do you expect approval, mid-'23? Is that reasonable? How quickly do you expect to commercialize it do you expect a similar kind of LMR to what we saw with Omnipod 5? And what kind of contribution are you expecting this year and next year? And just lastly -- I'm sorry for all the questions. Who is the sweet spot for this product, which patients do you think are ideal Thanks, Larry. I'll start -- I'm going to start with the back end of your question and ask Bret to comment on the front end of your questions. We think the sweet spot customer is a person with type 2 diabetes who is currently doing daily injections or it has not started daily injections. And so because they've been putting it off because they have a needle phobia or the Cetin convenience are trying to do it or they are on daily injections, but they're missing their daily injections because they don't like doing it. I mean so what basal only does is it gets upstream in the patient progression for people with type 2 diabetes. And people with type 2 diabetes as a general rule, have a lot going on. They have a lot to manage. And so we think there's real power with that customer at that stage of transitioning into or having just casting into insulin usage where we can really radically simplify their experience, make sure they get their daily insulin with high convenience, ease of use, no felt needles. We think there's a lot of power in it. The research we've done shows that there's power in it, and we expect it to really need a need in that part of the market.  And then importantly, those customers will use Omnipod, the Omnipod platform, they'll get used to the on-body experience. Almost every person with type 2 diabetes who needs insulin, progresses in their needs for insulin and they need -- they go from they go from, say, once-daily basal to intensive insulin need, which is a basal-bolus which is Omnipod 5. And so we're moving upstream with an offer that genuinely simplifies the experience for those people. But then gets them ready to transition as their needs transition on Omnipod 5. And Bret, you might -- if you could get the other part of Larry's question, that would be great. Bret Christensen : Yes, absolutely. So Larry, the first part of your question, around timing and clearance of course, we won't comment on that except that we have said it is with the FDA. And so we're happy with that. We won't speculate on when we'll get approval. We did say we'd start commercialization likely in 2024 we wil surely launch in a limited fashion, just as we did with Omnipod 5, we just think that's the best practice. There's a lot we want to learn. We want to scale manufacturing; we want to refine the commercial model. We've got to build access remember, with this product. So we're having conversations today with payers, and those are going well. You should expect that we'll launch in a limited fashion. We'll probably start in the call point where we exist today, which is mostly endocrinology and some of the high-riding primary care physicians. And then we'll figure out how we tackle this population as they do reside with primary care, family practice doctors, some with endocrinology as well. We're excited about the product. We think it fills a clear need -- and it's going to be really exciting, but we're refining the commercial model and the launch plans right now. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from Jefferies. Matt Taylor : Congrats on a good result. So I wanted to ask you kind of a conceptual question investors have accessed this and I'm curious to hear your answer. Just with all of the new diabetes drugs and the loss drugs. I think in the most extreme form of this argument, people would say, \"Oh, use you're going to cure diabetes and potentially have an impact on your market and demand for pumps. So I guess, what would you say to investors who have that question about whether the whole classes of new drugs can actually impact the market? Does it curb your opportunity at all? Or do you think that it's just sort of a side show? Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Matt. I'll start with that. The first thing is we're thrilled to see innovation in the diabetes space. That's why we get out of bed every day -- we want to help people with diabetes -- we want to make sure they get the care they need. We want to simplify their lives, we want to improve their outcomes. And so to see a lot of companies innovating in this space, whether it's drug companies, device companies, data companies. We're really happy to see that kind of innovation for the same people we're trying to help. And so that's all a positive. In terms of all the -- all these new drugs, it's early days to see. I mean, there's been -- obviously, there have been a lot of noise and results in the market around it. I think it's early days to know how they will impact the progression, really, they're aimed at people with type 2 diabetes and they may or may not impact the progression of disease. I think if you look at some of the clinical studies, what you see is, in many cases, the people in the clinicals for those drugs were actually also insulin users, which is an interesting dynamic. But what I keep coming back to is there are 0.5 billion people on the planet with diabetes. Most of them have type 2 diabetes, -- everywhere the Western diet goes, type 2 diabetes follows. And so it's a massive unmet global medical need. And I don't think it's going to have a material impact on our business. There's so many people for us to help. It's a massively underpenetrated market. And as happy as we are to see people get helped with new innovations, our goal is to continue to innovate our platform, and we think there will be more than enough people for us to sustain quite a lot of growth as we help them. Bret Christensen : And Jim said it, the value proposition of our basal-only pod is not -- is not to compete with the GLP-1s, and these great drugs that are out now like Epiduo we think that it's a complement to those. And Jim said it many of those patients in those clinical studies were on insulin. We know and we hear from physicians all the time. that patients do not get on insulin soon enough. And so that's the goal here with the basal-only pod is to remove the needle phobia, to improve adherence and to complement in many cases, these drugs that are already helping people with type 2 diabetes, and we think there's a clear spot for it. But again, we'll learn all of that in our limited release and as we launch the product. Operator : Our next question comes from Travis Steve from Bank of America. I did want to ask about the patents. -- been 11 movements in the patents on your side lately in the last few weeks. So is that more about protecting the current portfolio? Or is it more about building a pipeline -- are you expecting the space to get more litigious over the course of the next 2 years? And then I also wanted to ask about the -- I think you heard you leverage in leverageable investments, and I know that how you thought about kind of margin kind of beyond 2023, if you can get back to the kind of normal couple of hundred basis points of margin expansion. Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Travis, and thanks for your congrats. I'll start with the IP stuff and then I'll ask Wayde to comment on the margin side. It's a little bit of both. We're really bullish on our IP, and we've been working all year actually for months before that, but we've had a concerted effort this year to make sure that we are not just showing up our IP position but growing our IP position. And we've done that, as I said in the prepared comments, we've done that through a number of avenues, including organically, we filed a record number of patents this year. And then we made some settlements, we made the settlement with Medtronic to shore up our position and pay some certainty. And then the acquisition of patents. And as you know, with IP, it's both end, right? And so the more IP you have, the better position you are in terms of playing defense, but also the better position you are in terms of commercializing sort of ideating creating new offerings and commercializing them. So we think it's put us in a great position on both of those. And specific to Bigfoot Biomedical, they had a very rich very rich set of intellectual property patents and filed patents, granite patents and filed patents that we find really interesting from an innovation point of view. But it's both and in terms of offense and defense. Wayde McMillan : Jim, I could pick up on the margin piece of the question. And so Travis, as you said, we've been committed to margin expansion. -- and we've had to hit pause here for a couple of years, and that's mainly driven by the macroeconomic pressures that many businesses have felt. And from an investment strategy standpoint, we had a choice to make, and we decided that instead of reducing our investment in commercial expansion and research and development, that we would continue to invest through this inflationary cycle -- and even though we're paying higher cost for components and it's putting pressure on our gross margins, in addition to some of the business model challenges like with Omnipod 5 at a slightly higher cost and our U.S. manufacturing facility taking some time to hit an inflection point and still a higher cost facility for us. We decided to continue to invest heavily in our leadership position, and that is just because of this large market opportunity that Jim just referenced. And we've got a really strong leadership position to build on here. and we want to make sure that we're as best positioned as possible. And then you're right, Travis, we included in our prepared remarks, that continued commitment. And we think that given the investments that we're making up till now and through 2023 will put us in a position to start to leverage gross margins and operating margins again starting in 2024. We haven't put a number on it yet or given guidance yet. We're just confident that we're in a good position with the investments we're making now, both in the U.S. and internationally and across our operations to start to leverage again in 2024. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Jennings from Cowen. Thanks very much. Wanted to ask about the type 2 opportunity in the U.S. or just the current business. The 15% to 20% of new patient starts -- are you seeing the DASH conversions to 05 in that segment? Or are you seeing of that 15% to 20% of the patient starts '05 accounting for Haripaccounting for a big slug of that? And how are you thinking about -- or what's making the guidance for Omnipod 5 and Type 2 before we have clinical data and on label or an on-label decision by the FDA. Bret Christensen : Josh, I'll take the first part of that question and I can let Wayde comment on guidance. So the 15% to 20% that we referenced, -- that's a percentage of all new starts. So new starts for us are new to brand, never been on Omnipod. And those are -- so those are truly coming from either MDI or a competitive to pump, and that's the percent of all new starts that were type 2 for us. So historically, that's been as high as 40%. It's a lower percentage today, but only because the Omnipod 5 numbers are so high. And for the second half of this past year, we've been spending a lot of time in the field speaking to physicians about Omnipod 5, educating the staff, explaining the algorithm, helping patients get on board.  And so a good portion of our field time has been devoted to the launch of that new product. But the raw numbers type 2 patients new to Omnipod are really not that different. It's just the percentages are down. We think the offering is fantastic. We look forward to this year where now that physicians are comfortable with Omnipod 5 or writing prescriptions that we can start to have a portfolio sell in the field and start to talk about the type 2 offering with DASH and the value that Omnipod firing. So it's still a fantastic opportunity for us that is really, really underpenetrated and we're excited about. Operator : Our next question comes from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Margaret Kaczor : I wanted to maybe talk a little bit about the volume benefits that you guys have had and part of it is the retail pharmacy part is a just the upgrade from older generation Omnipod. So if we take those 2 individually, you've got 80,000 retail pharmacies in the U.S. should all of them have 05 as of what you've seen to date, which ones do? And I guess, how is throughput there? And then similarly, in terms of the volume benefits of upgrades, where are we right now within that process if you guys could us kind of even a rough percentage and whether or not that should impact the '23 numbers at all or guidance? Jim Hollingshead : Sure. Margaret, I can start with the conversion insights and the volume and then Bret, probably best positioned to talk about the expansion because those are 2 of the major drivers, which, as you know, Margaret, we called out in the prepared remarks. Just to confirm for everyone, we call conversions, our existing Omni podders, whether classic Omnipod or DASH, who convert over to Omnipod 5, which is a little different than the 2 pump market, I think, which cause them upgrades.  And to be clear, we do not call conversions or upgrades, new customers. Those are not factored into our new customer totals because for us, it's an annuity model. And so as people move from older products to new generations, we don't call them new shipments or upgrades or whatever others in the market call them. For us, it's just customers converting to the latest technology. And where we're at in that is making great progress. In fact, as Jim had in his prepared remarks, overwhelmingly success here with a lot of our existing customers wanting to move on to Omnipod 5 and frankly, put some of the stress on the system in the first couple of months. And so significant conversions. And we think, Margaret, that we'll be through most of them by the end of 2023. But just as a reminder, until we get a type 2 indication for Omnipod 5 and maybe even after DASH is still the product for type 2 customers.  And so we'll still have quite a few DASH customers on type 2 and those won't be converting over to Omnipod 5. So those are the major drivers of the volume benefit. Obviously, the single largest driver for us is new customer starts, and we've had record new customer start quarters for some time in the U.S. So that's the major driver of the volume benefit. And then also, as you mentioned, retail pharmacies, that is also a smaller component of the $5 million ramp benefit we called out here in the quarter as we start to stock retail pharmacies. Bret, do you want to pick up with that one? Bret Christensen : Yes, Margaret. We have talked about the 85,000 or so retail pharmacies in the U.S. And we don't report out on how many of those pharmacies have distributed Omnipod, but we do get that information from IQVIA is obviously it's substantial. But the reason is -- I don't think it's that important because what's really important to me is how many pharmacies have access to 75 and can dispense Omnipod 5? And the answer to that is really almost all of them because we've done a really good job building the channel out. We've got product with all the major wholesalers and those wholesalers supply Omnipod 5 to the pharmacy. So -- as far as the 85,000 retail pharmacies as far as the are there and how much Omnipod is on the shelf, it's really not that much because when a physician sends a prescription to a pharmacy, it's about 24 hours that a wholesaler will send Omnipod to that retail pharmacy.  In most cases, that's how it's happening. In some cases, those retail pharmacies do stock Omnipod when they know they've got regular Omnipod customers picking up their product every month. But the channel is really strong. And the reality is that most of those pharmacies have the ability to distribute Omnipod. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Pasquale from Nephron. Chris Pasquale : I was Hoping you could provide some more detail on when you think you could have G7 integration. Is that something we should expect in the second quarter -- and then the lack of an iOS app has really been sort of an afterthought in not successful the 05 launch has been, but you've been working on it for a while now. Is that something we should expect in the next quarter or in '23? Any clarity there would be great. Thanks. Jim Hollingshead : Chris, for your question. I\u2019ll start. We\u2019re working really closely with our partners, both Dexcom and Abbott on CGM integration and working really hard on \u2013 as you know, we don\u2019t give advanced notice of time lines that we expect or anything like that. I\u2019ll just say that we\u2019re working really hard, and we see them both is extremely important \u2013 and we\u2019re very bullish on completing integrations across the ICGM space as those CGMs become available. On iOS, that work continues to go really well. Same answer. We don\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re not reporting on time lines. But that app is, I think, progressing really, really nicely. And as we have more news, we\u2019ll give it to you. Operator : Our next question comes from Kyle Rose from Canaccord Genuity. This is Caitlin on for Kyle. What's the full impact of pricing in 2023, including the upgrades of everyone to DASH and '05? And can you break that out from a volume mix perspective? Wayde McMillan : Calin, it's Wayde. That's not a metric that we break out. But as you highlight, we do benefit from the premium in the pharmacy channel. And that's largely driven by the conversions we have from the DME channel as well as new customers coming on through the pharmacy channel. I'll just remind everybody that part of the headwind that we have in gross margin is because we give the PDM for no charge. And so as we're significantly ramping up new customers here, that's one of the impacts that the Omnipod 5 product cost impacts our gross margins. But having said that, pricing is a smaller component of our revenue growth. The far larger components are volume, including the initial volume ramp here with Omnipod 5 and this 2-script benefit that we're getting at the early stages here in the first couple of quarters -- and so we don't break out that metric for you, but it's something that's been positive for us, and we think it will continue to be positive for us in the pharmacy channel. Operator : And we have time for one more question. It will come from Matthew O'Brien from Piper Sandler. Matthew O'Brien : Great. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just -- and this question might be for Wayde. But Wayde, when I look at the U.S., the absolute dollars in the U.S. from -- over the last couple of years here. I know there's an adjustment for the stocking that we saw in '22 about -- I think it was around $80 million. you're up from '21 to '22 about $150 million. When you net that out at $80 million out, you're $800 million up to about bilo1.1 billion in '23. So you're up almost $300 million year-over-year when you make those again, those adjustments for stocking.  So what I'm trying to figure out is, I know Q2 was a monster as far as patient ASCO or Q1 is going to be the same thing. But just what does that imply as far as new patient adds on the MDI side, and you're clearly expanding the market, what does that imply as far as market growth goes? And what does that imply in terms of competitive share conversion as well? Because it seems like there's an acceleration implied there as well to get there. And then from an infrastructure perspective, do you have everything in place, manufacturing customer service to support this almost doubling of U.S. Omnipod revenue over a couple of year period? Wayde McMillan : I didn't leave a lot on the bone there, Matt. That's a broad question with a lot of areas to answer. I think -- and I got to be honest, I didn't follow the stocking math that you were doing there that we don't have anything that we track in the order of magnitude that you were talking about there. So let me try to get at, I think what the question is getting at, which is how are we continuing to grow the business and in particular, in the U.S. And because we don't have any hundreds of millions, normalization items that you're talking about. From time to time, we will call out increases or decreases in the channel. And so just to confirm, for 2022, -- we had nothing in Q1.  In Q2, we had $7 million channel increase as we started to roll out Omnipod 5. And then here in the third and fourth quarter, we've called out this additional script benefit, $16 million in Q3 and $15 -- so when you normalize for those, we're talking about a 4% impact in the U.S. And so not to the orders of magnitude you were getting at, but something that we certainly want to be aware of because most of that volume benefit is being driven by converting customers. And just so everybody is aware of what this dynamic is that we keep talking about. It's -- as we launch Omnipod 5, the new customer will get a starter kit, which is their personal diabetes manager as well as their initial order of pods. And if they also get their first pharmacy script order, they will get, say, for example, 2 months in September. So September, they get their initial starter kit and they get their first order. What we're curious to see is how that would impact our second quarter of Omnipod 5. And what we did see is a good percentage of customers actually skip an order and use up those pods. And so we did see a benefit as well, again, for people getting 2 scripts in Q4. And when you net the 2 of those out, it was approximately $15 million. And so that was our estimate. If you -- again, if you normalize for those, we're talking about a 4% impact and that's why we're calling it out. If you go to the share -- part of your question then, Matt, was, are we taking share? Absolutely. There's no question that we're growing at accelerated rates in the United States, way above market growth. And as Bret and Jim highlighted earlier in the call, we had a record number of competitive switches, which means, in the past, we used to get about 20% of our customers from competitive switches, 80% from multiple daily injection. You see in the metrics we provided here, that's now 65% MDI, 35% competitive switches. Both of those are record numbers, record number of competitive switches, record number of MDs coming new customers, new to pump therapy coming on to our products. So we do think that we'll be a share taker for some time to come. We've talked about a lot of the things on the call today that we think are continued drivers of our business that keep us in the leadership position. So I'll probably leave it there, Matt. I look forward to catching up with you after the call and see if we can clear any other parts of your question. Operator : And we have a question from Steve Lichtman from Oppenheimer & Company. Steve Lichtman : Congrats, everyone. You mentioned on DTC that you'll be putting the foot down here near term. Can you talk a little bit about what your plans are there? What form will it take? When are you planning on kicking that off? And do you see that as a particular opportunity once you get a type 2 label for Omnipod 5? Bret Christensen : Steve, yes, it's Bret. Thanks for the question. I don't know if we're putting the foot down, but we are starting to use DTC for Omnipod 5, and you'll start to see that via TV. We've always been strong with social media, digital advertising and now we'll start TV with Omnipod 5 this quarter if you haven't seen it already. So you'll start to see a little bit of that we'll see how it goes. And then as far as the type 2 opportunity goes, we know there's an opportunity to create awareness for sure with type 2. But we'll see how that goes with the launch of Basel pod. Have done for type 2 with a focus on Medicare free trial, things like that in the past with the DASH product. So you won't see anything with pot of course, until we get a label, I won't see anything with Basel pod. -- and the focus this quarter will be DTC for Omnipod 5. Operator : This will conclude today's Q&A section. I would like to turn the conference back to Jim Hollingshead for closing remarks. Deborah Gordon : Jim, sorry about that. This is Deb. Just before you close, I just want to let everybody know that call to your attention that there was an error in the earnings release, it was in the appendix in the adjusted earnings per share reconciliation. One of the EPS adjustments should have been a reduction to EPS, not in addition. And therefore, I just want to let everybody know that non-GAAP adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.49 instead of the $0.55 that's shown, and we'll be issuing an update shortly. Just note also, there is no change to adjusted EPS for the full year. It's correct as shown.  Sorry, Jim, go ahead. Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Deb. That's a real-time catch everybody. So I hope everybody stayed on the call long enough to get that update. So thanks, Deb. And thanks, Julian, for shepherding the call. And more importantly, thank you, everybody, for joining us today. These are remarkable and really exciting times at Insulet, and we are just getting started fulfilling our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes around the world. Omnipod 5 is clearly transforming the diabetes landscape, and we continue to deliver strong financial performance and strengthen our global competitive position. So thank you all, and have a great evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Insulet Corporation First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations. Deborah Gordon : Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for Insulet's first quarter 2023 earnings call. With me today are Jim Hollingshead, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Wayde McMillan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bret Christensen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, is also with us for the Q&A portion of our call. Both the replay of this call and the press release discussing our 2023 first quarter results and guidance will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Also on our website is our first quarter supplemental earnings presentation. We encourage you to reference that document for a summary of key metrics and business updates. Before we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such statements. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating margin, adjusted EBITDA and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. These measures align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance, and we believe they are helpful to investors, analysts and other interested parties as measures of our operating performance from period to period. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis with the exception of revenue growth rates, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim. Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're off to a great start to 2023. We entered the year with a clear strategic focus and momentum in our business, and the Insulet team continues to execute and deliver on our ambitious expectations. We expect 2023 to be another year of strong growth and strategic progress. Our first quarter results exceeded our expectations, and today, we increased our revenue outlook for the rest of the year. We achieved another record first quarter for U.S. revenue growth of 49% and 35% for total Omnipod and once again delivered another record for U.S. and global new customer starts for any Q1. Omnipod 5 continues to be a driving force of our strong U.S. growth and in Q1, it represented almost 95% of our U.S. new customer starts. This revolutionary offering is transforming diabetes management. Last week, we also received FDA clearance for our basal-only Pod named Omnipod GO. This is a unique product for the type 2 market. It provides us with early entry into treatment pathway, gives physicians and people with diabetes a comfortable non-injection option to deliver and receive insulin and provides patients an improved experience. By eliminating the personal diabetes manager and offering preset levels of basal insulin, we are easing patients into insulin management while leveraging Omnipod's comfortable tubeless technology. We're excited about bringing this innovation to market in 2024. Now to Omnipod 5, which continues to disrupt the diabetes market with its elegance and ease of use as well as consistently impressive real-world outcomes. It has strengthened our position as the market leader by revenue and is rapidly helping us take leadership among new pump prescriptions, thanks to our high share of multiple daily injection new starts and the large number of customer switches from competitive tube offerings. In Q1, the mix of Omnipod new customers coming from MDI and legacy tubed pumps was an estimated 70/30 split compared to our historical 80/20 mix as a result of the strong number of competitive switches we continue to capture. Omnipod 5's ease-of-use, simplified access, quality of life and strong clinical outcomes, coupled with our team's execution, has positioned us to continue to win across all market segments. Omnipod 5 is truly unmatched compared to other AID systems, and the feedback we hear from customers speaks to its unique benefits. We recently heard from a health care practitioner who operates a clinic with almost 3,000 patients across both type 1 and type 2, many of whom use one of our Omnipod solutions. He has hundreds of patients now on Omnipod 5, and he is using it himself. He called Omnipod 5 a \"game changer\" and said, \"Thank you for everything you do. I've waited 40 years for this product, and it's more than what I had hoped for.\" This sentiment is echoed by so many HCPs who tell us that their Omnipod 5 patients span all age groups, including people over the age of 80 who have been on MDI for decades and would never have considered pumps before learning about and experiencing Omnipod 5. Omnipod 5 is delivering on our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes. Much of this success is a testament to how we designed our system. As we do with all of our innovations, we designed Omnipod 5 with the customer 100% in mind, with a clear focus on how we could simplify each day, improve quality of life and drive better outcomes. We offer an algorithm that provides micro doses every five minutes to adjust the target versus other systems that need to adjust basal rates or give correction boluses. Plus with Omnipod 5, there is no need to disconnect. Our algorithm learns, adapts and personalizes for each user. Our users are able to achieve excellent time and range with the lowest incidence of hypoglycemia on the market. The real-world evidence we shared at ATTD with data from more than 31,000 Omnipod 5 users is unmatched by competitors. And we look forward to sharing a larger data set at the ADA Trade Show next month, building on the clinical outcomes and quality of life that only Omnipod 5 can provide. These clinical outcomes, combined with Omnipod 5's form factor and ease of use, are proving to be life-changing for our users. Our market leadership also depends on building awareness of and access to Omnipod, and our team continues to execute with excellence against these objectives. Our efforts to drive access and awareness are critically important, given how underpenetrated the global type 1 and type 2 pump markets are, driving growing need for advanced solutions. In the countries we serve today, we estimate there are approximately 11 million people with insulin-intensive diabetes who can benefit from Omnipod. Approximately 45% have type 1 and 55% type 2, and these markets remain vastly underserved. Pump penetration in the U.S. type 1 market is still only approximately 40% and only low single digits in type 2, and international market penetration is much below the U.S. There is a massive unmet need for insulin therapy solutions, which also means we have a massive market opportunity. The Omnipod platform, and especially Omnipod 5, will open that market even further. Prior to Omnipod 5, consensus was there was a natural cap on pump adoption of around 70%, but these estimates have all been built based upon the adoption curve of tubed pumps. You've heard us call Omnipod 5 a game changer, and we believe it changes this game. Omnipod 5's simplicity, ease of use, cost and access and, importantly, outstanding clinical outcomes driven by our advanced algorithm will allow us to bring customers into the market who would have otherwise never considered or never been considered for an insulin pump. We are seeing this in our market feedback already. Additionally, CGM is helping to pave the way by raising awareness for Omnipod and, in turn, we are bringing more people to CGM. Our sources indicate CGM U.S. type 1 market penetration is nearing 80%, making us even more confident in Omnipod 5's potential to grow penetration to well over 70% in the type 1 market alone. The Omnipod platform is quickly becoming the new standard of care for insulin delivery. A critical element to our access strategy is growing our presence in the U.S. pharmacy channel. This makes access to Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH much more affordable, convenient and efficient, with low co-pays and the ability to pick up product at the local pharmacy or through mail order with no lock-in periods. And the vast majority of Omnipod 5 prescriptions are filled in a matter of days compared to weeks through the DME channel. In the U.S. market, we price Omnipod 5 at parity with Omnipod DASH to drive access for Omnipod 5 quickly so we can make it affordable for the large number of people we knew would want it. The vast majority of our U.S. customers continue to pay less than $50 a month through the pharmacy channel, putting it relatively on par with customer costs for multiple daily injections. Combined with no upfront cost to start on Omnipod 5, we invite any patient to experience the difference of Omnipod. Omnipod 5, just like Omnipod DASH is widely covered in the U.S. Our team\u2019s customer-centric focus and commitment to operational excellence enabled us to drive incredibly strong coverage for Omnipod 5 in a short period of time, positioning us for the enormous level of affordable broad-based adoption we have seen. And as such, we will no longer provide quarterly coverage updates similar to the approach we took with Omnipod DASH. In practical terms, both Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH are now fully covered. Our clinical initiatives continue to progress, including our type 2 pivotal study. As a reminder, this three month study will be the largest we have ever conducted, including up to 350 people with type 2 diabetes across 20 sites in the U.S. with a targeted focus on recruiting diverse and underserved populations. We began enrollment shortly after our last earnings call and we\u2019re making great progress. We\u2019re excited to show what Omnipod 5 can do for people with type 2 diabetes. We are also making great progress with our Omnipod 5 three month randomized controlled trial. The last study participant in the U.S. is nearing completion and in France enrollment is nearing completion and we expect the last participant to complete the study by the fall. We believe this RCT study will be beneficial when negotiating access and premium pricing. Both our type 2 pivotal study and our RCT will be valuable additions to the already strong clinical body of evidence that we have been building for Omnipod 5 over the last several years. Fueled by the success of Omnipod 5, our teams are already working on what\u2019s coming next. As I mentioned, we received clearance for Omnipod GO in the U.S., which should further build on our type 2 leadership position. We estimate the total addressable market for Omnipod GO is at least 3 million people in the U.S. alone, doubling our U.S. TAM. We expect to begin a small pilot program this year in select locations and remain on track for a commercial launch in 2024. We have several competitive advantages in the type 2 space, including those that exist for us in the type 1 market, such as our unique form factor and our U.S. pharmacy channel access. In Q1, individuals with type 2 represented an estimated 15% to 20% of our U.S. new customer starts across our Omnipod portfolio of products. This percentage is lower than historical levels due to the tremendous success of Omnipod 5, which like all AID systems has an indication for only the type 1 market. On an absolute basis, new customer starts in the type 2 space remains strong. Our development work to integrate Omnipod 5 with DexCom\u2019s G7 and Abbott\u2019s Libre systems, as well as our iOS integration efforts continues to progress very well. I want to take a moment to congratulate Abbott on their recent Libre 2 and Libre 3 iCGM clearance milestones. That is quite an accomplishment. Both of our CGM partners have made exciting progress and we\u2019re thrilled to be advancing our development efforts with both for the benefit of our current and future customers. We believe we offer the best AID system on the market and adding CGM of choice for our current as well as future customers will only strengthen that value proposition. Moving on to our international operations where we are excited to introduce Omnipod 5 in the UK in the middle of this year and in Germany in the fall, and we are currently training HCPs in both markets. This marks the first time we\u2019re bringing a cloud connected Omnipod device to international markets, delivering the benefits of near real-time data management to our customers and HCPs. Our launch of Omnipod 5 in these countries marks the beginning of our stage international rollout with a broader rollout across our international markets next year. Another one of our competitive moats is our global manufacturing capabilities, which are critical to our long-term growth plan and ability to fulfill our mission. While we continue to navigate some challenging macro-related headwinds, we are securing components and producing pods ahead of forecasted demand levels, ensuring global supply for our expanding customer base. Additionally, we are making great progress building our new manufacturing facility in Malaysia, which will further strengthen our global capabilities. We are on target with our build schedule and expect to take possession of the facility by the end of this year, placing us on track to begin manufacturing in 2024. Earlier this week we published our 2022 sustainability report noting exciting progress across a number of environmental, social and governance initiatives. As a result of all of our initiatives, we were named by Newsweek as one of America\u2019s most responsible companies for 2023. This past quarter, we also were pleased to be added to the S&P 500. This is a fantastic achievement for Insulet and speaks to the hard work and dedication of our entire global team as well as the success we are having growing the company and executing our mission. Before I turn the call over to Wayde, I want to comment on the changes to our organizational structure we announced this afternoon. Our business is enjoying incredible momentum and we are confident we can build on that. Omnipod 5 is transforming diabetes management and we are just getting started. Omnipod 5 is a revolutionary offering, delivering the most convenient therapy experience with world-class clinical outcomes as our results clearly demonstrate. And Omnipod 5 is also novel because it gives us the opportunity to use cloud connectivity and data to constantly improve all aspects of the end-to-end customer experience. In addition to that, we are now the market leaders in the type 2 space and we have a huge opportunity to expand there with the portfolio of therapy options. And of course, we are early in our efforts to expand internationally. In order to capture those opportunities and reach the millions of patients that need our help, we\u2019ve decided to make some changes to how we operate. It has been almost a year since I assumed the CEO role and I could not be more proud of how well our team continues to execute. Over that time, we\u2019ve taken a close look at our organizational structure and working processes and in order to both continue our momentum and capture the full palette of opportunities we see for growth, we need to do three things, elevate and integrate our technology stack and especially our cloud and data analytics capabilities, invest in regional and local markets to drive growth and expansion and most importantly, get even closer to our customers and orient the entire organization around the end-to-end customer experience. Therefore, as we announced earlier today, we have created two new roles in the organization effective July 1. The first is Chief Product and Customer Experience Officer responsible for product vision and execution, including franchise management, product management and driving the end-to-end customer experience across the enterprise. Eric Benjamin, our Executive Vice President of Innovation and Strategy will take on this new role. The second is Chief Technology Officer responsible for software and hardware engineering, information technology, cybersecurity, digital and data services and system architecture. Mark Field, our Group Vice President of Software Engineering will step into this new role. On behalf of the entire Insulet team, I\u2019d like to congratulate Eric and Mark and thank each of them for their leadership. We also announced that in order to more effectively drive growth in our international markets, we are transitioning from a structure that had a Global Chief Commercial Officer role to one with two distinct commercial leaders, one for U.S. and another for international. As a result of that decision, Bret Christensen is leaving Insulet on May 5 to pursue other opportunities. He has agreed to provide consulting services during the transition period. We want to thank Bret for everything he has accomplished during his time at Insulet. He played an important role in so many key milestones for us, including our moving to the pharmacy channel and of course the launch of Omnipod 5. We wish Bret all the best and I know he wishes us all the best as he\u2019s here today with us on the call as well. Thank you, Bret. I\u2019m confident that the refinements we are making to our organization structure will help us to not only continue our terrific momentum, but also improve our efficiency, speed our time to market with new innovations and accelerate our growth in international markets. I look forward to continuing to work with our entire Insulet team to realize our company\u2019s immense potential and continue to drive our mission to simplify the lives of the millions of people around the world living with diabetes. In closing, the first quarter marked a strong start to what we are confident will be another successful year for Insulet. Omnipod 5 is transforming the market and changing the way that people manage their diabetes. HCPs are adopting and championing Omnipod 5, helping to bring it to the thousands of people with diabetes who benefit from it. We are well positioned to continue to expand access to Omnipod 5 globally and lead the industry and innovation. It takes a company-wide effort of all of our employees to generate the growth we are consistently delivering, while investing in our business to drive sustainable growth and value creation for years to come. I will now turn the call over to Wayde. Wayde McMillan : Thanks, Jim. First quarter results exceeded our expectations and we made further strategic progress. We delivered record U.S. and global new customer starts for any Q1. And in the U.S., they were the second highest of all time, slightly below last quarter\u2019s record. We generated 23% revenue growth in Q1 finishing above the high end of our guidance range. This was driven by total global Omnipod growth of 35%. On a reported basis, for total revenue, foreign currency was a 210 basis point headwind compared to Q1 of last year. U.S. Omnipod revenue growth was 49% exceeding our guidance range. Revenue growth continues to be driven by our annuity-based model with cumulative record new customer starts and growing U.S. pharmacy volume. This includes an increasing contribution from Omnipod 5 and a premium for the Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH pods in the U.S. pharmacy where we provide the personal diabetes manager for no charge. Omnipod 5 ramp dynamics, unlike prior quarters, resulted in a net headwind for the quarter of $2 million. Similar to last quarter, we benefited from an estimated $14 million net volume benefit associated with new Omnipod 5 customers in large part due to existing customer conversions from Omnipod DASH and Classic Omnipod who received their starter kits and first refill orders in the quarter, as well as some initial stocking in retail pharmacies. This is net of some Omnipod 5 customers skipping an order in the period. This benefit was more than offset by a reduction in estimated channel inventory days on hand for Omnipod 5 of approximately 8 million and another 8 million reduction associated with actual and expected sales returns for Omnipod DASH and Omnipod Classic as retail pharmacies convert their inventory to Omnipod 5. Consistent with Q4, our Q1 Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH new customer starts combined where 100% of our total U.S. new customer starts, which we expect to be the case on an ongoing basis. This is especially important given our focus on moving increasing volume through the pharmacy channel, which was over 85% of our total U.S. volume in the quarter. International Omnipod revenue increased 10% in Q1 exceeding our guidance range driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption. On a reported basis, foreign currency was a 620 basis point headwind over the prior year, which was in line with our guidance. Our estimated global attrition increased slightly to approximately 10% in Q1. We estimate international attrition increased to over 10% as a result of continued AID competition, while U.S. attrition improved to under 10%. We estimate global utilization trends remain consistent with seasonal trends. Drug delivery revenue declined 98% within our guidance range. Gross margin was 67.2%, representing an approximate 380 basis point decrease, which included a favorable foreign currency impact of approximately 30 basis points. Cost of revenue included income of $8 million due to a lower estimated cost associated with the medical device corrections we announced last year. Excluding this benefit, gross margin was 64.9%, representing a 610 basis point decrease in line with our expectations. Our growing volume in the U.S. pharmacy channel, including the associated premium positively contributed to gross margin. This was more than offset by expected higher mix of cost due to the ramping of Omnipod 5 and our U.S. manufacturing operations as well as unfavorable mix from lower drug delivery revenue. Operating expenses were slightly above our expectations to support higher than expected revenue and we\u2019re higher than Q1 of last year as we further invested in our business. Adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA were 5.5% and 13.6% respectively. Both exclude the favorable medical device correction adjustment of $8 million and both were above our expectations due to a higher than anticipated revenue. Turning to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with over $620 million in cash and the full $100 million available under our credit facility. Our financial position remains strong and offers us the flexibility to strategically invest in our business, further strengthen our innovation pipeline and deliver growth for years to come. Now turning to our 2023 outlook. For the full year, we are raising our expectation for total Omnipod revenue growth to range of 21% to 25% and total company revenue growth to 18% to 22%. For U.S. Omnipod, we\u2019re increasing our revenue growth outlook to 27% to 31% driven by continued strong Omnipod 5 adoption coming from both new customer starts and ongoing conversions from other Omnipod products, as well as recurring revenue from Omnipod DASH and the benefits of our pay-as-you-go model. We continue to expect the cadence of our revenue growth to be weighted more to the first half of the year, given a tougher comparison in the second half of the year, resulting from the Omnipod 5 full market release in the U.S. in August of 2022. This includes the related volume benefit from the accelerated pace of customer conversions in the second half of 2022. For international Omnipod, we are reaffirming expected revenue growth of 6% to 10%. On a reported basis, we now estimate a favorable foreign currency impact of approximately 200 basis points. Growth will be driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by AID competitive headwinds.  As a reminder, given the nature of our annuity model, we are not expecting a material contribution from Omnipod 5 in our international markets in 2023. Lastly, for drug delivery, we continue to expect a decline of 55% to 45% representing a dollar decline, similar to what we experienced in 2022. Turning to 2023 gross margin. Excluding the impact of the voluntary medical device correction, we continue to expect gross margins to be in the range of 65% to 66% consistent with 2022 at the high end. Favorable impacts this year include the benefit of increasing volume in the U.S. pharmacy channel, favorable geographical sales mix and manufacturing improvements. These drivers will be offset by higher costs associated with our U.S. manufacturing ramp, product line mix due to increasing Omnipod 5 volume and inflation. As we\u2019ve said before, we expect many of these factors to impact our results into 2024. We expect Q2 gross margin to be near the low end of the range and the second half of the year to be closer to the high end of the range. This improvement will be driven by increasing volume in the pharmacy channel and improving manufacturing performance. We continue to expect operating expenses to rise due to investments in our sales and marketing efforts, including the phase launch of Omnipod 5 in our international markets, as well as expanding our innovation pipeline and clinical efforts and scaling our support functions. We continue to expect adjusted operating margin to be in the high single digits similar to 2022 levels. We also expect improvement in the second half of the year over the first half due to timing of investments and improve second half gross margins. We remain committed to margin expansion and expect to begin to leverage investments in 2024 and beyond. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be at a lower level than 2022. Turning to our second quarter 2023 revenue guidance. We expect total Omnipod growth of 29% to 32% and total company growth of 27% to 30%. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect growth of 37% to 40%. Our growth drivers remain the same. The ongoing adoption of Omnipod 5, including the benefits of the U.S. pharmacy channel and our continued strong new customer starts as well as the benefits of our annuity model. For international Omnipod, we expect growth of 13% to 16% driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by AID competitive headwinds. On a reported basis, we estimate a favorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 100 basis points. Finally, we expect a Q1 drug delivery revenue decline of 25% to 20%.  In conclusion, we are on track to deliver another strong year of financial results and operational performance. We achieved a number of milestones this past quarter and are incredibly excited about the year ahead and the opportunities we see to further our mission, improve our customers\u2019 lives and drive value for shareholders. With that operator, please open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Johnson from Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jeff Johnson : Thank you. Good afternoon guys, and congratulations on the quarter. Bret, we\u2019ll miss talking to you at the meetings, so good luck in your next endeavors. Jim or maybe Wayde, I wanted to look at your international guidance for 2Q. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lot of questions we could ask about the strength in the U.S. for Omnipod 5. But that 13% to 16% growth, it\u2019s about 400 basis points to 500 basis points above where the Street sitting for 2Q. Obviously, you talked about some increased AID adoption that we all know is going on over there. We\u2019re seeing you talked about the increased attrition. It\u2019s hard for me to reconcile the strength you\u2019re expecting in 2Q and even over the balance of the year there if oh five [ph] is not going to contribute a lot, so what\u2019s going right in the international business? And how are you accelerating that growth given some of those attrition and competitive factors you talked about? Thanks. Wayde McMillan : Yes. Hey, Jeff. We would love to start talking about Omnipod 5, but why don\u2019t we go ahead and talk about international for a second. So as you point out, we had a strong Q1 at 10%, and that\u2019s about what we\u2019ve been performing over the last couple years. 11%, 12% performance over the last couple years, 10% Q1. Q2 does look a little higher, but it\u2019s more just some of the choppiness that we see in the international markets due to the distributor nature. And so we do have a bit of a higher growth rate that we\u2019re planning based on some of the order timing there. If you look at the second half growth rate, it offsets it, and then it looks to drive us in for the full year around the 6% to 10% or just double digits at the high end. And we\u2019ve been performing at that level for the last couple years. We think we can continue to drive that at the high end. Really depends on how the second half performance goes. And as you know, we\u2019re not participating in the AID portion of the market internationally. And so right now, DASH is doing really, really well. Without an AID system, we\u2019re still growing double digits internationally. And as you know, we can\u2019t wait to bring Omnipod 5 first to the UK mid-year and then Germany now in the fall, and then to further countries next year. And so we think we\u2019ll significantly improve our performance even above the double digits we\u2019re at now once we get Omnipod 5 and our AID system into that market. Operator : Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Larry Biegelsen : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Jim, I can\u2019t help but ask about your congrats on a really good quarter here. I can\u2019t help but ask about the comment you made about over 70% penetration of pumps in the type one population. I guess, could you put some timing around that? What do you think needs to get done to make pumps standard of care? It has moved relatively slowly and it is interesting to see that your 80/20 split has gone to 70/30 with Omnipod 5, which suggests that a higher proportion are coming from competitive pumps? Thanks for taking the question. Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Larry. Thanks for your congrats on the quarter. We\u2019re very happy with the quarter too. Yes, I think the key point, we don\u2019t have a timeframe on that overall pump penetration. I think the key point we\u2019re trying to make is that Omnipod 5, the Omnipod platform and especially Omnipod 5, are fundamentally different and better from tube pump offerings that were first introduced into the market. And because of that, they\u2019re so simple to use that as the market goes through a learning curve, we firmly believe we\u2019re seeing hints of it all right, right now already, and we firmly believe that more and more people will both consider using a pump, a wearable pump, and more and more doctors will consider putting patients onto an Omnipod 5 platform product that they wouldn\u2019t have considered a year ago. It\u2019s just because the easy use is so high effect. If we go back to ADA last year, one of our investigators finished his talk about Omnipod with the statement that given this offering, it\u2019s now the case that everybody in the market should be considered for pump therapy. And so we think that those penetration models, which everybody has been talking about and banging [ph] around numbers for quite a long time, are really obsolete. We think that Omnipod 5 is going to bring more and more people to market. That\u2019s going to be true in type one where CGM is already very well penetrated and has paved the road for us. We think it\u2019ll be even truer for us in the type two market because people with type two diabetes have such a burden in managing their disease. It\u2019s very difficult for them to get approved for insulin pumps. It\u2019s very difficult for them to manage everything they\u2019re doing along with the tube insulin pump. We think the simplicity of Omnipod 5 is going to drive penetration on that market as well. We see it as a huge opportunity. Operator : Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Robbie Marcus : Oh, great. And congrats on a really nice quarter. For my question, Omnipod 5 is clearly doing great. It\u2019s taken share, record new patients in a first quarter, just below a fantastic fourth quarter. So I think the current momentum isn\u2019t it question here, but as we look forward, you are having guidance growth slowing a bit, really wanted to get your sense on how you think about balancing, bringing in those new patients that are not using a pump right now versus some competitive entrance, particularly Medtronic 780G and Tandem\u2019s Mobi that\u2019s coming later this year. And how you think the trajectory of new patient ads can continue not just in the short term, but over the next, let\u2019s say five years or so? Thanks. Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Robbie. We\u2019re really bullish on the coming five years for our business and for our growth trajectory. And the mix of the \u2013 mix of patience for us MDI versus competitor, has moved a little bit in the quarter and that sort of thing. I\u2019ll just say a couple of things. The first one is we have the best offer on the market. So if you\u2019re just thinking competitive, sort of the three main competitors in the market. Our offering is clearly superior. We\u2019re clearly winning in the market right now. We\u2019re taking \u2013 we\u2019re bringing a lot of people out of MDI into the market, and we\u2019re taking competitive share and driving competitive switching, which continues to run ahead of our historic pattern and ahead of frankly our expectations and in terms of competitive switching. But we don\u2019t think about the market that way. The way we think about the market is not as a zero sum game amongst the pump players. We think of the market as a market with literally tens of millions of people that need insulin therapy that need a much simpler solution. And so our entire offer is geared to bring people off of multiple daily injections and all of the burden of multiple daily injections into a simple wearable, disposable, waterproof pump. That requires them to not have to do a lot of calculations, don\u2019t do finger sticks and just manage their condition that way. And so we\u2019re extremely bullish. We have a very clear lead on the whole package. We have a fantastic algorithm. And the whole package for Omnipod 5 is so simple. The wear experience is simple. The channel access is simple. The economics are great for patients. The economics are great for payers. So overall, we\u2019re extremely bullish on the ongoing growth. And given our lead, we\u2019re just going to extend that lead. We have tons of innovation coming in the pipeline and our reorganization is going to allow us to move even faster with that. So we think our \u2013 we love the momentum we have right now. We intend to continue it, and we think the midterm, long-term outlook is really, really strong for us. Operator : Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you very much for taking the question. Two questions. How should we think about drug delivery over time? Does this essentially go to zero? And then the second question is, ADA is coming up. What should we be looking forward to? Thank you. Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Joanne. I'll take a shot at both of those, but I'll invite either way or Bret to comment and give some color. So, first one, on drug delivery, look, we \u2013 that's a \u2013 that's been a great business for us. It's because \u2013 as we grow, as Omnipod 5 grows in particular, it's becoming less and less material for us. And \u2013 but we've really enjoyed delivering that product to our partner at Amgen. And we know that product makes a difference in people's lives in that therapy area. That business is lumpy for us and has been. And so, we expect that to continue to decline. I don't know, Wayde, if we're going to guide on it dropping a zero, I, we expect some revenues and we've made some progress there, so I'll turn that to Wayde. But first let me comment on ADA. Yes, we're excited about ADA. ADA is in San Diego this year. I think you all know that. I'm based in San Diego. So it's right here in my backyard. Very excited for it to be here. We will be bringing more real world evidence publications to ADA. We'll be showing some real world evidence around type one usage. We'll be showing some real world evidence around type two usage. We're really excited to build on what we showed at ATTD this year. And as I've said in the past, and you've heard us say in the past, we think that the cloud connectivity of Omnipod 5 puts us in a unique position to be able to have insights into real usage cases across the population of people using the Omnipod 5 pump. So we'll be showing more exciting data at ADA, and we hope you'll come and see us. Wayde? Wayde McMillan : So just, Jim covered it really well. I'll just add quickly on the drug delivery side of things. We have a great partnership with Amgen, and we're very proud of the fact that our technology combined with their product has really helped them continue to sell their product and defend against biosimilars given our delivery device. And so we do think it's going to have a long tail, Joanne, we would expect it to be several years, if not five or more years, that will continue to provide the product for them. We're not going to guide, as Jim said, it's a lumpy business just based on the order patterns. But we think we'll continue to provide that product. The overall strategy for the drug delivery business has not changed for us, although there are many growth options for us there. We are laser focused on the diabetes side of the business. And we've got so many investment opportunities to grow the diabetes side of the business and invest and create value that we are just not turning our focus to drug delivery at this time. But it still remains as growth options for us out there in the future. Operator : Our next question comes from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Margaret Kaczor : Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow up on Larry's question and maybe push a little bit more on that 70% plus market penetration. But maybe tie it to some of the comments around the organizational change. First of all, Bret, congratulations on everything you've accomplished. It's been awesome working with you. And hopefully, our paths cross again, but you deserve everything that you've done. But maybe as we think about kind of that market penetration, there's a lot of T1D patients that maybe don't routinely go to an endo. You talked about getting closer to the patient. I think you talked about both regional, local offices. But Jim, you're a strategist. I've seen your work. So is this a commercial effort to try to get into the PCPs? Is there a more virtual way of doing that? How are you guys thinking about it as you think about that 70%? Thanks. Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Margaret, for the question. It's a great question. We think \u2013 first thing I'll say is it's \u2013 the logic of it is such that, right. So to me, the Omnipod 5 offering is just so compelling that \u2013 and what we see when we have patient feedback is the ease of usage is so high, and we get these messages from patients literally every day. And we think it's just \u2013 there's a compelling logic for people to be using Omnipod 5 instead of MDI. And it's a better life experience. It's better outcomes with MDI. And so just on the weight of that, it's really important. I'll point out that there are many endo practices right now, where more than 70% of their type 1 users are on a pump, and most of them are on Omnipod 5, right. And so Omnipod 5 has allowed them to bring more of their patients on to Omnipod 5 therapy. And so we see that playing out. But if I just pick up on the other side of your question, which is around channel, a couple of things that I think are just really powerful for us. So the first one is we certainly know, we know that there are PCPs out there who already are heavy writers, obviously have a big part of their focus on treating people with insulin therapy, treating people with diabetes. We have those mapped. We periodically call on them. With Omnipod GO, that's going to be an even more important part of our business. And part of what we'll be doing as we do commercial pilots is figuring out the mix of how we call on those kind of \"high writers\" in the PCP market. But Omnipod 5's simplicity will also help PCPs feel comfort in writing. And we're seeing an expansion of people who write prescriptions for Omnipod 5. So just \u2013 just put some numbers to that. We've said \u2013 you've heard us say before that physicians are increasingly comfortable with writing prescriptions for Omnipod 5, and we've seen that learning curve go through the market. In this quarter, we had more than 11,000 health care practitioners who wrote a script for Omnipod 5. And that's in a market where there are just about 7,000 endocrinologists out in the market. So more than 11,000 people writing for Omnipod 5. So we see a lot of evidence that we're going to be able to do exactly what we set out to do as a company when we found it, which is bring a simple, really simplifying offer broadly to the market that's easy for patients to use and easy for physicians to prescribe and easy for people to get access to and get set up on. So we're very bullish on driving more and more penetration, bringing more people in the market. Our play is a growth play. It's not a competitive switching play. And I think that's really important. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew O'Brien from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Matthew O'Brien: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I would just love to hear a little bit more about integrating with G7 and Libre 2 and 3, just general thoughts on timing there. Do you think you'll be second in the AID market with both of those new CGM products? And then any kind of commentary just as far as what opportunity you see with accessing Libre patients. To me, it seems most likely that they would probably go with O5 if they do decide to go on a pump. Just any kind of general commentary there would be helpful. Thank you. Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Matt. We continue to work really closely with both Dexcom and Abbott, our 2 great CGM partners. We're really pleased to see their continued technology advancements in the market. We were excited to see G7 approved earlier in the year. And as we said and as I said in our prepared comments, we congratulate Abbott on getting both Libre 2 and Libre 3 cleared as iCGM. That's a big accomplishment. So we're very excited to bring sensor of choice to all of our customers as soon as we can. We're making great progress with both partners on completing those integrations. And we haven't guided on timing. I'm not going to speak to what our competitors are going to do, but we're moving as fast as we can. And we're excited to bring those innovations to market just as quickly as we can. In terms of \u2013 there's \u2013 you've got two big players out there. So your question about penetration in different sensors and who will choose what, we think Omnipod 5 is the best offer in the market. We think it's going to be the best offer for anybody wearing any sensor, which is why we want to bring choice to all of those customers and all of those patients. It's obvious that between those two players, they have millions of patients out there that are already using their sensors. And for us, that creates a kind of a \u2013 I think I've said \u2013 I've used this metaphor before on these calls. I used to go fishing with my dad. He would always say, well, let's go to the pond that they just stocked with the trout. So as we get out there, we're fishing in a stocked pond. And so they've been paving the road for us. There's lots and lots of patients out there that both of our partners are delivering terrific, wearable on-body experiences in managing their diabetes. And we think that Omnipod 5 will very seamlessly slide into that on-body experience and provide great solutions to people wearing both Dexcom and Libre sensors. Operator : Our next question comes from Travis Steed from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Travis Steed : Hey, thanks for the question and congrats on a good quarter. Maybe a quick clarification for Wayde. I wanted to make sure we had the numbers right on the stock, destock this quarter. It looks like the net impact would have been a negative $2 million headwind, so U.S. growth, 50% in Q1. So I wanted to make sure I had those numbers right. And then the question is really on the guide up in Q2. I don't know if that's what you're seeing in April, if it's really the strong Q1 you that had. And then \u2013 and how to think about the second half because it looks like the second half guide is about mid-teens growth, which looks conservative at this point. I just want to make sure I understand the flow of the year for the U.S. growth. Wayde McMillan : Hey Travis, yes. I'm glad you asked because we do have these dynamics with Omnipod 5 as we ramp up. And as you know, we haven't annualized yet. This is just our third quarter ramping with Omnipod 5. And so it does cause some unique dynamics. And we experienced similar stocking. Majority of the $14 million we called out is due to our existing \u2013 moving from either Classic Omnipod or DASH onto our new Omnipod 5 system. And when they do that, some customers will get their starter kit and their first reorder in the pharmacy and that creates a onetime volume benefit. We also benefit from new customers who have that same dynamic and then, to a much lesser extent, a small build in the retail pharmacies as retail pharmacies start to stock Omnipod 5 as their foot traffic increases with the rollout. What \u2013 so that ended up with $14 million, which is very similar to the $16 million and the $15 million we've had in the last two quarters. What was unique this quarter and added to that, that resulted in a net small headwind, as you mentioned, a $2 million headwind, was the return reserve that we had to put up. So this is a new dynamic for us as the pharmacy channels are switching over from DASH and Classic Omnipod to Omnipod 5, and they're doing it at such an accelerated rate that they have the contractual right to return to us the prior products. And so we set up a reserve. We saw that increase here in Q1. So a portion of that is actuals in the quarter. The rest is a reserve for what we estimate to come throughout the rest of the year. So those are the major drivers for us, including a days-on-hand decrease. And this is for the Omnipod 5 business. And of course, we don't control the inventory levels at our wholesalers. And their inventory goes up and down from time to time. Just a reminder that in Q2 of last year, we saw a $7 million channel increase for Omnipod 5. So in some respects, this is just giving that back and leveling out the channel here. It took a few quarters for that to happen. So we're going to keep a close eye on it, but we want to make sure whenever we see a change, material change in days on hand, we call it out for you all. And then in reference to the guide, Travis, we do see really strong momentum. We've set record new customer starts in the U.S. for multiple quarters. And so that's what gives us confidence in raising the growth rate for Q2. And then comparatively, when you're looking at first half to second half growth percentages, the second half is when we annualize Omnipod 5 from the prior year. And so it's a much tougher comp. And then inside of that, we have our remaining customers converting from Classic and DASH to Omnipod 5, which will start to ramp down in the second half of this year, and we think we'll be through most of the eligible customers to convert. And so we won't get as much benefit in the second half of this year as we did in the second half of last year. And so that compounds the tough comp a bit. But if you're looking at the pure growth rates on an extrapolated basis, for the U.S., we're looking at the second half in \u2013 at the high end, over 20%, low 20s growth rate at the high end. And so that's what we're focused on, continuing to drive the business, even with a tougher comp, well over 20%. And so that's the major dynamics. We've got plenty of year to go yet. So we increased the second half growth rate because we've got good line of sight to that given our annuity model. We're going to continue to monitor the second half, and we'll provide further updates as we go throughout the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Pasquale from Nephron. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Chris Pasquale : Thanks. Congrats on the quarter. I wanted to spend a minute on Omnipod GO and the path forward there. Can you walk us through some of the key milestones between now and when you think it will be ready for a commercial launch? And in particular, I'm curious about coverage and market access because I know you've highlighted those as gating factors before. So are there some studies you want to run? Or anything else that's going to get done this year to get you ready for next year? Thanks. Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Chris. Obviously, we received clearance for Omnipod GO, which is one of the poles in the tent. We're really excited to get that in such an expeditious way. It's terrific. There's other things that we need to get in place to make sure that we can launch at scale. As you said, one of the main ones is reimbursement. And so we announced when we filed Omnipod GO, actually, if you guys remember just before we filed Omnipod GO, because we wanted to be able to go to payers and start to talk about coverage. And those conversations are going, they're going pretty well. And we expect to be able to have broad enough coverage to launch certainly in 2024. And then the other things we have to figure out is Omnipod GO is a new-to-world offer. So it's in the Omnipod product form factor, but it has no controller, it doesn't take a CGM feed. So it's very, very simple to use. It's a multiple SKU product because each SKU will have a basal rate associated with it. So the way we've designed it is a physician would write a prescription for Omnipod GO 10 units or something very simple like that. But we need to go out and make sure that the customer experience is \u2013 we fully understand the customer experience of getting that new-to-world product, and we fully understand the physician experience of writing it and making sure there's appropriate access for everybody. So we'll be doing some pilots to test out those models, to test market reaction and test customer experience and so on. And when we're confident we have those right, we'll move to a commercial launch. We're not gating them on a date. We're not holding back the date. We want to make sure we're ready to launch the experience that we want to deliver to all of our customers, including both patients and health care providers. And we're moving pretty quickly, so we'll move as quickly as we can, but we're going to continue to guide to 2024. Operator : Our next question comes from Kyle Rose from Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Caitlin Cronin : Hi. This is Caitlin on for Kyle. Congrats on a great quarter. Just to kind of go off of the GO question earlier, have you begun enrollment on the T2 pivotal study? And can you kind of remind us of the time lines for the study? And then U.S. customer starts coming from Q2, where do you really think this could go in the future as you kind of gear up GO in the longer term? Thanks. Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Caitlin. The Omnipod 5 type 2 pivotal is going really well. And just as a reminder, I think we said in the comments, too, today that it's intended to be up to 350 patients across 20 sites in the U.S. And we're already enrolling that, and enrollment is going really well. We have both patients and investigators are really keen to be in that study. And so enrollment is going really, really well. We're really excited about it. And we haven't put a time line on it for everybody, but I'm sure everybody understands what happens is we have to \u2013 that's a 90 day \u2013 every patient is in the trial for 90 days. So you enroll the patients. Each patient stays in the trial for 90 days, and so there\u2019s a rolling cadence of the patients being in the trial, then the last patient completes, then you gather the data, then you clean the data, then you analyze the data and then when that\u2019s already, we send it into the hands of the FDA. So there\u2019s multiple steps we have to go through. We haven\u2019t put a timeline on that. But we\u2019re very confident first that it\u2019s moving pretty quickly. And second, we\u2019re really confident in the results. You\u2019re doing a trial because you have to get the results to finish the trial. But we know from our feasibility study that we published last year that the results for Omnipod 5 for people with type 2 are terrific, really terrific time in range and significant reduction in actual daily dose of insulin, which is a benefit both to patients and to payers. So we\u2019re very bullish on that. The overall \u2013 when you think about the overall landscape, we\u2019re already the leader in type 2 with DASH. We continue to have and enjoy a lot of new customer starts. As a percentage of our new customer starts, most of those are coming onto DASH because that\u2019s where we have an indication for use. So we\u2019re already the market leader in insulin pump therapy with Omnipod DASH. We know we\u2019re getting off-label usage right now for people with type 2 diabetes using Omnipod 5. We don\u2019t promote Omnipod 5 for people with type 2 diabetes, but physicians write it, physicians prescribe it. And so we know we\u2019re seeing that already, which is also an early indication of success for us and we really would love to be able to promote it, which is why we want to get the indication for use. And then Omnipod GO is upstream of intensive insulin therapy. So Omnipod GO designed to really simplify management of their condition for people with type 2 diabetes who are on basal only, which is how most people in the U.S. initiate insulin therapy on a basal rate. So by launching Omnipod GO, we move upstream. We simplified basal rate insulin therapy for people initiating, and then as their needs progress, they\u2019re already used to the Omnipod form factor, how to put on a patch, how to use an Omnipod product. And when they need intensive insulin therapy, we anticipate it being very seamless for them to slide onto. If it\u2019s going to happen tomorrow would be on to DASH, but the timing will probably be such that most of those patients will be progressing onto an Omnipod 5 product once it gets its indication for use. So we think we have a terrific portfolio of offerings already in type 2 and we\u2019re really excited to continue to drive growth in that market and drive solutions for people living with types 2 diabetes. Operator : Our next question comes from Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jayson Bedford : Hi. Good afternoon. I\u2019ll be quick here. On the RCT, you mentioned that it would support premium pricing. I just wanted to clarify is that premium pricing relative to tube pumps or premium pricing relative to your current offering in Europe? Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Jayson. Our intent is to deliver enough evidence into various markets such that we can go and secure reimbursement that we think is more in line with the value that we deliver with Omnipod 5. We think Omnipod 5 delivers a lot of value through its improved patient experience and improved outcomes. And so \u2013 and those negotiations are going and will go market by market. And so I think that what you\u2019ll see is we\u2019ll probably have slightly different reimbursements and slightly different levels of premium in any given market depending on what we\u2019re able to prove to those state payers and what we\u2019re able to negotiate over time. We may be also able to ramp reimbursement over time as we\u2019re able to deliver more evidence. But as we\u2019re entering into those conversations, we want to have as much evidence as we possibly can, which is the purpose of that RCT. And as a reminder on that one, it\u2019s a two geography study, it\u2019s U.S. and France. The U.S. \u2013 the last U.S. patient is completed. We have about 75% enrolled patients in France, and we expect that to wrap up in the fall. And then we\u2019ll have that as another era in our quiver of evidence as we go and talk to those payers to secure the \u2013 what we think is fair reimbursement for the value Omnipod 5 creates. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Taylor from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Matthew Taylor : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So I wanted to go back to your comment on the penetration rate, potentially going through 70%, given all your advantages. I wouldn\u2019t dispute that, but you made some interesting comments that you\u2019re starting to kind of see the green shoots of that. And so my question on the follow-up there is what kind of rate of change are you seeing or do you think that we could see driven versus the traditional 75,000 or so MDIs coming to market converting to pump every year in the U.S.? Any thoughts on that? Wayde McMillan : Matt, it\u2019s Wayde. Happy to take that and I think Jim covered it well, but maybe just a couple things I could add to that. I think as Jim said, one of the best indicators we have is that there are some type 1 endocrinologists that are already have more than 70% of their type 1s on a pump. So that\u2019s a clear early indicator. One of the other things we\u2019re looking at is the pediatric penetration rate, which is much higher than the adult penetration rate, already in excess of 50%. And so that tells us that as the population ages over time, we\u2019re already seeing a higher penetration rate out of the pediatric space. So it\u2019ll just be a natural increase in penetration as the population of people on pumps increases. And of course, we\u2019re the market leader in impedes and really driving that early penetration rate for type 1s. And so the rate of change, I think is a great question that you have. It\u2019s going to be interesting to see how the market curve develops here. But just one other thing I would add, Jim mentioned that we\u2019re bringing \u2013 we\u2019ve got a chock full list of innovations to bring to market. This early indicator where we see some clinics already over 70%, and that\u2019s before we bring CGM of choice, before we bring iOS, before we bring software and hardware improvements over time. And the competition is also improving their products over time. And so I think between all of us, we\u2019re going to bring great technology for people with diabetes and for our customers here and just going to have much better technology solutions for delivery of insulin. And so that\u2019s what gives us the confidence that we can take this to 70% and above. And of course, Jim covered this, but the CGM early indicator, they are paving the way for us in all markets now, even just the basal only market, which is one of the great things about the Omnipod GO program, but just sticking with the type 1 in the U.S. and the pump market given that CGMs are up at 80% today, and we know that we bring more customers to CGM as well, so there\u2019s a lot of other early indicators there that tell us that we can get this penetration to 70% or above over time. But it\u2019s a great question on the rate of change. We\u2019ll see how that market develops. The good news is we have many other growth platforms, obviously our leadership position in type 2 in the U.S. and then our international expansion plans and bringing our Omnipod 5 AID system to international markets, and then of course, expanding our offerings with Omnipod GO in the basal only market. So, lots to get excited about with our innovation pipeline today. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Lichtman from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Steven Lichtman : Thank you. Hi guys, and congratulations. Wayde, just thinking on gross margin, obviously a lot of moving parts here and you talked to some of that falling into 2024. But thinking over the medium to long-term, just given some of the work you\u2019re doing in expansion in Malaysia, how are you thinking about leveraging that line as you look out over that medium term? How much does international offset that? Just trying to think through the cadence over the next three to five years. Thanks. Wayde McMillan : Yes, Steven great question to think down the P&L as well, we\u2019ve got a lot of momentum on the top line and we think that we\u2019re going to be adding significant value with gross margin and operating margin expansion over time. Focusing here on the gross margin, and to your question, medium to long-term, we\u2019re not putting numbers on it, but we know we\u2019ve got a lot of tailwinds. We\u2019re not assuming the component higher inflationary costs to improve, but we\u2019re also not assuming they get worse from here. We\u2019re assuming they\u2019ve sort of leveled out and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to live with for some time. And so assuming the inflationary environment then stays flat for us, the built-in benefits that we have with scaling the business, additional volume and the move, the geographic mix of growing the U.S. faster as well as the move into the pharmacy channel is all going to provide us some tailwinds to gross margin. The other side of the coin, what we have to watch is how fast we expand internationally. And just given that we use a distributor model there, our gross margins are sometimes lower. That doesn\u2019t mean our operating margins are lower because we obviously have a lower cost to serve where we use the distributor market there. And so it\u2019s going to be a combination of those things, but we\u2019re not going to put numbers to long-term guidance at this point, but we do think we can continue to grow gross margins over time. And we\u2019ve had a long-term goal of getting to 70%. We still think that\u2019s in view over the medium horizon here. But we just have to manage all of these dynamics continue to improve our manufacturing performance, which is also another driver for us. And that\u2019s going to help us work our way to 70% over time. Operator : We have time for one last question. It will come from Marie Thibault from BTIG. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Sam Eiber : Good afternoon, everyone. This is Sam Eiber on for Marie. Thanks for taking the questions here and congrats on a nice quarter. Maybe I can just ask on OUS, so we\u2019re gearing up for initial market introduction in the UK in the next couple months or so. I guess any other work that\u2019s needed in terms of developing that cloud infrastructure and you mentioned some market preparation. Any more details in terms of what that looks like going on now ahead of some of those launches? Thanks for taking the questions. Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Sam. We\u2019re really pleased. We\u2019re very excited to be bringing Omnipod 5 to the UK and Germany this year. Obviously since we\u2019re really late in stage and readiness there and we\u2019re all ready to launch those products, the cloud infrastructure and those markets is completely ready to go. And we\u2019re training healthcare practitioners right now and our teams are really excited to launch. So we\u2019ll be doing those, as we said in the summer and then \u2013 summer in the UK and then fall in Germany. There is some work to do. The cloud infrastructure is scalable and so we\u2019re in good position in terms of how we\u2019re building that cloud across Europe. There is some specific work market by market to be done. Sometimes it\u2019s technical, sometimes it\u2019s agreement based because the regulations by market are a little bit different in terms of data privacy and security. And the channels are a little bit different. And so you are \u2013 as you step into a market, you\u2019re launching a cloud-based offering, you might have a different agreement with a different hospital system, things like that, that have to be worked through. So those are really the steps that we have to do. But we\u2019re excited to get those launches going in Europe and then really excited to continue to cascade across the international geographies in 2024. Operator : This concludes our Q&A section. I would like to turn the conference back to Jim Hollingshead. Jim Hollingshead : Great. Thank you everybody. Thanks again for joining us today. Obviously we\u2019re thrilled with our start in 2023 and we\u2019re focused on sustaining that momentum for our entire business both for the rest of the year and beyond. The future for Insulet has never looked brighter, and the future for people with diabetes is incredibly bright. We look forward to continuing to update you on our progress over the year and next quarter. We\u2019ll see you then. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Insulet Corporation Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations. Deborah Gordon : Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you joining us for Insulet's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. With me today are Jim Hollingshead, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Wayde McMillan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  Both the replay of this call and the press release discussing our quarterly results and our guidance will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Also on our website is our second quarter supplemental earnings presentation. We encourage you to reference that document for a summary of key metrics and business updates.  Before we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such statements. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely adjusted gross and operating margins, adjusted EBITDA and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth excluding the effect of foreign exchange.  These measures align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance, and we believe they are helpful to investors, analysts and other interested parties as measures of our operating performance from period to period. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis, with the exception of revenue growth rates, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim. James Hollingshead : Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. In Q2, we enjoyed another quarter of sustained strong momentum, and we remain on track for another successful and transformative year. The entire global Insulet team is executing at a high level, and we continue to deliver strong financial performance while also achieving several key strategic and innovation milestones.  On today's call, I'll touch on 4 main topics : our strong financial performance, our consumer-focused innovation and clinical achievements, how we're continuing to drive penetration of a massive market opportunity with expanded access and awareness and the Omnipod 5 international launch. Starting with our financial performance. Our second quarter revenue exceeded our expectations with total Omnipod growth of 33%, including U.S. growth of 41%. We also achieved total company growth of 32%. Because of these terrific results, we've raised our outlook for the year. Omnipod 5 continues to disrupt the diabetes technology market as the only FDA-approved fully disposable, pod-based automated insulin delivery system. Our flagship offering continues to be the major driver of U.S. revenue growth and was responsible for another record quarter of U.S. and global new customer starts. And Omnipod 5 represented almost 95% of our U.S. new customer starts.  Building on our success in the U.S., we are very pleased to have completed the commercial launch of Omnipod 5 in the United Kingdom. We are excited to bring our unmatched AID system to our first international market. Our plans to launch Omnipod 5 in Germany are on track for this fall with a broader staged rollout across our European markets in 2024.  We also meaningfully advanced our clinical and innovation initiatives during the second quarter. We had a formidable presence at ADA in June where we presented compelling new real-world data from the first year on Omnipod 5 in the U.S. for both type 1 and type 2 users. In addition, our U.S. type 2 pivotal and U.S., France randomized controlled trials are progressing well.  On the innovation side, we are thrilled to have submitted our 510(k) to the FDA for the Omnipod 5 iOS app for the iPhone. iOS phone control is one of the most requested features from our customers, and we look forward to bringing this new offering to market in the near term. We entered the second half of the year with clear momentum in our business and a focused strategy to advance our mission to simplify and improve the lives of people with diabetes.  Central to everything we do is our drive to deliver consumer-focused innovation. That is why we are incredibly excited about Omnipod 5 and the game-changing technology and experience it delivers. Its benefits are clear : simple and easy-to-use technology, an unmatched form factor and customer experience, affordability and broad access through the pharmacy channel, and notably, strong real-world clinical outcomes. Omnipod 5 continues to have very broad appeal and is attracting substantial new customer starts across all age groups. In Q2, the mix of Omnipod new customers coming from multiple daily injections and legacy tubed pumps was an estimated 75-25 percentage split compared to our historical 80-20 mix.  We continue to capture significant tubed pump switches while also growing pump adoption from those coming from MDI, which is what our Omnipod brand of products was specifically designed for. Omnipod 5 adoption isn't the only evidence of considerable impact on the diabetes community. We are also seeing stable retention rates. We also saw a sizable increase in the number of HCPs who wrote scripts for Omnipod 5 in Q2, which was over 15,000, up from over 11,000 in Q1. That is in a market where there are 7,000 to 8,000 endocrinologists.  The power of Omnipod 5 is also illustrated by the ongoing feedback we receive across the diabetes community, from Podders to their parents and loved ones to HCPs and other caregivers. We recently heard from a Podder who said, \"Since switching to Omnipod 5, I have never looked back.\" And an endo at a very large clinic recently informed us that he has changed how he communicates with his type 1 patients. He now strongly recommends AID therapy for all, and in the clear majority of cases, they choose Omnipod 5. Our success-building awareness of and access to Omnipod is core to our strategy and ability to continue to lead in the type 1 and type 2 markets, both of which remain vastly underpenetrated. The market opportunity is massive. Excitingly, we see Omnipod 5 already contributing to overall pump adoption in the U.S., reinforcing our confidence that Omnipod will drive pump penetration to well over 70% in the type 1 market alone from the approximate 40% where it is today.  The U.S. pharmacy channel also remains a key driver of our success, expanding access to Omnipod in the United States. The pharmacy channel simplifies the overall experience for patients and provides more affordable, convenient and efficient access. The vast majority of our U.S. customers continue to pay less than $50 a month through the pharmacy channel, putting it on par with the customer cost for MDI. And we continue to hear from our customers how convenient it is to get their pod through this channel.  We are capturing the market opportunity and improving the lives of our customers through not only our advanced technology and clinical outcomes but also our product's convenience and simplicity. This quarter, we significantly advanced our clinical initiatives. We had fantastic representation at ADA, including standing room-only at our product theater and a record number of leads at our booth.  We presented Omnipod 5 real-world evidence, demonstrating improved outcomes for children, adolescents and adults with type 1 diabetes and, for the first time, Omnipod 5 real-world data for adults with type 2. The combined real-world data included 60,000 individuals across all age groups. Every day, we are building real-world evidence that undoubtedly demonstrates that our advanced algorithm and overall system is working exactly as it was designed and improving customer lives. Our real-world data will be incredibly powerful over time since every Omnipod 5 user is cloud connected. We can continue to personalize and improve the overall customer experience while also streamlining physician workflows. We will have unprecedented insight into actual population-level usage patterns, which will allow us to constantly improve our offerings and to build on our already market-leading product differentiation.  Every day, we are building usage data from our rapidly growing Omnipod 5 customer base, and we will be able to use this private, secure de-identified data to constantly improve the customer care experience, from diagnosis all the way through the course of their lives. We'll be able to learn from usage patterns, increasingly segment our offerings and drive coaching engines. To put it simply, the better we make the customer experience and streamline workflows, the more we'll have product preference, the more data we'll have, and it will effectively be a data flywheel that builds on itself. This is where we will continue to lead. Nobody else in diabetes therapy can create evidence from data that includes all patients on therapy.  As we also mentioned at ADA, we expect to begin enrollment in a matter of weeks for a trial using Omnipod 5 with the FreeStyle Libre 2 CGM, which will include up to 200 participants with type 1 diabetes across 18 institutions in the U.K., France and Belgium. It will be a 13-week randomized controlled trial, including those currently on MDI, with the primary endpoint of change in A1c. Although not needed from a regulatory perspective, we expect the data from this trial to support our pricing and access initiatives. We are excited that our integration with Abbott's Libre is far along and has advanced to the point where we will soon place study participants on the integrated system.  We also announced our first feasibility study of a next-generation AID algorithm, which will take place in New Zealand and for which recruitment began last month. This 11-week study will include up to 72 participants aged 16 years and older with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and is designed to assess safety and effectiveness. Our new algorithm work is informed by our incredibly strong usage data, which allows us to continue to advance our system in even more ways than we had originally envisioned. We advanced other major clinical programs during Q2, including our type 2 pivotal study, for which we expect to complete enrollment by the end of the year. As a reminder, this is a 3-month study of up to 350 people, making it the largest type 2 study we have conducted. The feedback we have received from HCPs and study participants is encouraging. HCPs are impressed with how well participants are doing on Omnipod 5, and the participants have strongly expressed their desire to stay on product after the trial's completion. Omnipod DASH has proven to be a game changer for people with type 2 diabetes, and we are confident Omnipod 5 can have an even greater impact on this underserved population. Lastly, our final participant in France is on track to soon complete our Omnipod 5 with Dexcom's G6 randomized controlled trial. Once complete, we will analyze and prepare the data to negotiate access and premium pricing for Omnipod 5 in our international markets. We expect providing this data will be one of many initiatives that will support our Omnipod 5 international commercial launches, which are now underway.  While Omnipod 5 is disrupting diabetes management today and is expected to do so for a long time to come, we know a robust innovation pipeline is necessary to drive sustainable long-term growth. We will soon begin our Omnipod GO U.S. limited commercial rollout, which will also include HCPs whom we don't typically call upon and that are \"new to Omnipod.\" This will allow us to test the market and expand our reach.  This new-to-market, simplified product will grant us access earlier in the type 2 pathway and addresses critical barriers that can prevent the initiation of insulin therapy, namely fear of needles as well as challenges with dosing accuracy and consistency. Omnipod GO will expand our addressable market by at least 3 million people in the U.S. alone who require basal-only insulin. We look forward to the key learnings from our pilot program, which will help inform our full market release in 2024. We are very well positioned in the type 2 market to grow adoption with Omnipod DASH and, soon, Omnipod GO, not to mention an expected future type 2 indication for Omnipod 5. We certainly have a number of competitive advantages in this space, including our differentiated form factor, an affordable pay-as-you-go business model and a pharmacy channel access. As a result, we continue to add a substantial number of type 2 patients to our customer base.  During Q2, people with type 2 diabetes represented an estimated 20% of our U.S. new customer starts across our Omnipod portfolio of products. Given the tremendous success of Omnipod 5, our type 1 customer base is growing at an incredible rate, far outpacing type 2. However, on an absolute basis, our type 2 new customer starts increased sequentially.  We achieved another major innovation milestone in June with our 510(k) submission for the Omnipod 5 iOS app. The FDA's review is progressing, and we look forward to continuing to work with the agency so we can provide the iOS platform option to our expanding Omnipod 5 customer base.  We are also advancing our integration efforts with both of our CGM partners, allowing us to provide future CGM of choice with Omnipod 5, which we firmly believe is the best AID system on the market. We expect these integrations will be one of many catalysts that fuel our long-term growth and strengthen our value proposition and, most importantly, allow us to continue to execute our mission to simplify and improve the lives of people with diabetes.  We continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio, which is a key asset enabling our continued growth. We also actively defend our valuable portfolio of proprietary technologies and innovations as appropriate.  As you may know, earlier this year, we successfully took legal action against the distribution of EOFlow's product in Germany. In that case, the court determined that EOFlow infringes Insulet's unique technologies, and the court quickly issued an injunction prohibiting EOFlow's distributor from further infringing on our patents in Germany. Subsequently, after further investigation, we filed an additional suit last week in the U.S. against EOFlow and other affiliated parties to stop the continued misappropriation of our valuable and proprietary trade secrets as well as the infringement of our patents and other IP.  We not only will enforce our patents when necessary, we also will zealously protect our valuable trade secrets. We are confident we have a clear lead both technically and in terms of scalability, and we will not hesitate to vigorously defend our IP when we see followers misappropriating or infringing on it in an attempt to catch up.  Moving on to our international operations. We are excited to have commercially launched Omnipod 5 in the U.K. in June. While it has only been a brief period of time, the market response has been fantastic. Following launch, we saw an almost doubling of our typical customer order rates, 1and we quickly started a considerable number of Omnipod 5 users throughout last month alone, including both new customers as well as those already on brand.  We are thrilled to provide our advanced technology to those who have long been waiting for it. We remain on track to launch Omnipod 5 in Germany this fall, closer to the beginning of the season with a broader staged international rollout in 2024. By the end of 2024, our goal is to have Omnipod 5 available for the majority of our European customers.  In closing, we've reached the midpoint of 2023 and have incredible momentum in our business. We are delivering strong financial performance and achieving key strategic milestones. We have advanced our commercial, innovation and clinical programs and Omnipod 5, and our entire business shows no signs of slowing down. We are well positioned to continue to expand access to Omnipod 5 globally and lead the industry in advanced innovation.  It's gratifying that others in the industry see our leadership and are attempting to follow our established best-in-class fully disposable patch form factor. We are investing for sustained leadership and widespread international expansion. We are transforming diabetes management, and we are only beginning to drive our life-changing innovations to market.  I will now turn the call over to Wayde. Wayde McMillan : Thanks, Jim. We delivered another strong quarter of financial performance and strategic progress and once again delivered record U.S. and global new customer starts. We generated 32% revenue growth in Q2, finishing above the high end of our guidance range. Our outperformance was driven by global Omnipod growth of 33%. On a reported basis, for total revenue, foreign currency was a 20 basis point tailwind compared to Q2 of last year. U.S. Omnipod revenue growth was 41%, exceeding our guidance range. Revenue growth continues to be driven by our annuity-based model with consecutive record new customer starts and growing U.S. pharmacy volume. This includes an increasing contribution from Omnipod 5 and a premium for the Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH pods in the U.S. pharmacy, where we provide the Personal Diabetes Manager at no charge.  Omnipod 5 ramp dynamics resulted in an estimated net headwind of approximately $4 million. Similar to last quarter, we benefited from an estimated $16 million net volume benefit associated with new Omnipod 5 customers, in large part due to existing customer conversions from Omnipod DASH and Classic Omnipod who received their starter kits and first refill orders in the quarter as well as some initial stocking in retail pharmacies.  This estimate is net of some Omnipod 5 customers skipping an order in the period. This benefit was more than offset by a reduction in estimated channel inventory days on hand of approximately $13 million and another $7 million reduction associated with an increase in actual and expected sales returns for Omnipod DASH and Omnipod Classic as retail pharmacies convert their inventory to Omnipod 5. The benefit of the pharmacy channel continues to be a competitive advantage, and we remain focused on driving increased volume through this channel, which in Q2 represented over 90% of our total U.S. volume.  International Omnipod revenue increased 15%, in line with our expectations. Growth was driven by continued strong adoption of Omnipod DASH in our international markets as well as a combination of items associated with order and revenue recognition timing that contributed approximately 300 basis points of growth. On a reported basis, foreign currency was a 50 basis point tailwind over the prior year.  Our estimated global attrition and utilization remain consistent. Our delivery revenue increased 18%, above the high end of our guidance range due to favorable production fees and timing. Gross margin was 66.8%, up approximately 320 basis points.  Cost of revenue included income of $800,000 due to lower estimated costs associated with the medical device corrections we announced last year. Excluding this benefit, gross margin was 66.6%, slightly above our expectations due to favorable manufacturing costs and higher-than-expected revenue, including favorable mix.  The 320 basis point year-over-year increase in gross margin was primarily driven by a premium from volume growth in the pharmacy channel, improved manufacturing efficiencies and a decrease in warranty expense. These were partially offset by higher costs associated with Omnipod 5 production, higher expected production costs as U.S. manufacturing continues to ramp and become a larger portion of our total production, as well as inflation.  Operating expenses were up year-over-year to support higher-than-expected revenue and investments in our business to further drive our strong growth trajectory. Adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA were 7.6% and 15.5%, respectively. Both exclude the favorable medical device correction adjustment of $800,000, and both were above our expectations due to higher-than-anticipated revenue and gross margin.  Turning to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with $660 million in cash. In June, we extended our credit facility 4 years and increased our borrowing capacity under the facility to $300 million, all of which is currently available. This strong financial position gives us the flexibility to invest in our expanding pipeline and other key areas of our organization and build on our foundation for long-term sustainable growth.  Now turning to our 2023 outlook. For the full year, we are raising our expectation for total Omnipod revenue growth to a range of 25% to 28% and total company revenue growth of 22% to 25%. For U.S. Omnipod, we are increasing our revenue growth outlook to 33% to 36%, driven by continued strong Omnipod 5 adoption coming from both record new customer starts and ongoing conversions from other Omnipod products as well as recurring revenue from Omnipod DASH and the benefits of our pay-as-you-go model in the pharmacy channel. As a reminder, we have a tougher comparison in the second half of the year, resulting from the Omnipod 5 U.S. full market release, which started in August of last year. This includes the related 2 script and retail channel stocking volume benefits, which were in large part due to the accelerated pace of customer conversions in the second half of 2022. For International Omnipod, we are raising the low end of our range and now expect 7% to 10% constant currency growth. On a reported basis, we estimate a favorable foreign currency impact of approximately 300 basis points. We expect growth will be driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by AID competitive headwinds. We are excited to have kicked off our Omnipod 5 international rollout. As a reminder, given the nature of our annuity model, we expect the Omnipod 5 launches to start inflecting in our growth rate in the second half of 2024. For Drug Delivery, we are raising the low end of our range and now expect a decline of 50% to 45%, representing a dollar decline similar to what we experienced in 2022.  Turning to 2023 gross margin. We continue to expect adjusted gross margin to be in the range of 65% to 66%, consistent with 2022 at the high end. Favorable impacts to gross margin include increasing volume in the U.S. pharmacy channel, geographical sales mix and improved manufacturing. These drivers are expected to be offset by higher costs associated with our U.S. manufacturing ramp, product line mix due to increasing Omnipod 5 volume and inflation. As we've previously stated, we expect many of these factors to continue to impact our results into 2024. However, we expect gradual improvement over the course of the coming years. We still expect gross margin in the second half of the year to be closer to the high end of the range.  Given our market leadership position and large unpenetrated market opportunities, we continue to expect operating expenses to rise with investments in our commercial, innovation and clinical efforts and scaling our support functions. We are reaffirming our guide of adjusted operating margin of high single digits and expect it to be closer to the high end of the range. We also expect improvement in the second half of the year over the first half due to timing of investments and improved second half gross profit. We remain committed to margin expansion and anticipate leveraging our investments in 2024 and beyond. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be at a lower level than 2022.  Turning to our third quarter 2023 revenue guidance. We expect total Omnipod growth of 20% to 23% and total company growth of 18% to 21%. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect growth of 27% to 30%. Our growth drivers remain the same : the ongoing adoption of Omnipod 5, including the benefits of the U.S. pharmacy channel, and our continued strong new customer starts as well as the benefits of our annuity model. With strong new customer start momentum, we continue to accelerate sequentially and, as a result, are guiding to strong sequential dollar growth in Q3. For International Omnipod, we expect growth of 2% to 5%, driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption and a modest contribution from our Omnipod 5 launch, partially offset by increasing AID competitive headwinds. On a reported basis, we estimate a favorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 800 basis points. Finally, we expect a Q3 Drug Delivery revenue decline of 30% to 25%.  In conclusion, we are delivering solid financial performance, achieving critical milestones and further positioning Insulet for long-term sustainable growth. We're on track to deliver another strong year of revenue growth and new customer starts while also investing in key areas throughout our global business in order to drive sustainable growth and long-term value creation. With that, operator, please open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Lawrence Biegelsen : Congrats on another nice quarter here. So Jim, I heard you say you're seeing no signs of slowing down, but as Wayde said, you're going to start lapping some tough comps in the second half of this year. The second half '23 implied worldwide Omnipod 5 -- Omnipod, I'm sorry, growth is about 21%. So how do you keep the momentum going at pod? Do you see yourself as a 20%-plus grower beyond 2023? And how are you thinking about these GLP-1s? James Hollingshead : Thanks, Larry. Thanks for your congrats, too, and thanks for your question. We're not seeing any kind of pause. The new customer starts for Omnipod 5 and the demand for Omnipod 5 has -- continues to be terrific. We obviously had record starts in the quarter. We see a lot of momentum across all age groups, as we said.  And so we're very bullish on the growth. I know you're asking me a question to guide beyond '23 because you want to ask Wayde that question, but I'm actually going to throw this to Wayde so he can work through the numbers there for the second half. Wayde McMillan : Sure. Thanks, Jim. And Larry, you're exactly right. We are almost completing 12 months of Omnipod 5, so it's been incredibly exciting to see the ramp here over the first few quarters. And we've got a couple of onetime things to account for.  If you recall, in the second half of 2022, the first 2 quarters of Omnipod 5, we're benefiting from a significant contribution from first customers and converting customers, getting 2 scripts in the quarter. And we called those out. They're similar to the benefit we got this quarter, $16 million. What's different is that we're now seeing some reduction in days on hand inventory as well as some increased return reserves in the pharmacy.  So a lot of dynamics playing out in the first year as we ramp up Omnipod 5. But as you call out, we've got a really strong guide, 30% for Q3 and implied for Q4 in the U.S. at the high end of the range. And so we're really excited about continuing to grow Omnipod 5 here at these [indiscernible] rates. Operator : Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Robert Marcus : And I'll add my congratulations as well on a really nice quarter. I hate to waste the question on this, but given the moves in the stocks today, particularly in diabetes stocks, I thought it would be good, Jim, maybe if you want to just address your view on, I guess, it would be more relevant to type 2 diabetes, particularly increased GLP-1 use. There was some good cardiovascular data today in obesity. Just your views on how GLP-1s may or may not impact the progression to type 2 diabetes and basal and intensive insulin. And just any impact and help investors frame it to your overall business. James Hollingshead : Sure. Thanks, Robbie. I know it's a question of high interest. So as we've said before, we think it's terrific to see the pharmaceutical companies continue to innovate with therapies for people with type 2 diabetes. We get up every day to help people with diabetes, people living with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. So we think it's terrific that innovation is happening across all fronts.  And the GLP-1 class of drug has actually been out for a while, but this latest generation of GLP-1s is clearly having a really big impact and has additional efficacy from the existing class. And obviously, they're off to a start. So we think all that innovation is really good. Having said that, we're confident it doesn't impact our TAM.  And just to give you a couple of reasons why, the first 1 is the global problem with type 2 diabetes is enormous. There are more than 0.5 billion people living with diabetes around the world, and that number continues to grow. Most of them have type 2 diabetes. So it's a massive unmet medical need globally and in the U.S. and massively underserved as a population. So that's the first thing.  The second thing is, when you look at our offerings, even in the U.S. alone, there are 2.5 million people living with type 2 diabetes who also need intensive insulin therapy today. So intensive therapy in basal plus bolus, so that's 2.5 million people in a U.S. TAM whose condition has progressed to where their relevant target market for us to help them with Omnipod DASH and soon with Omnipod 5.  And so we're just scratching the surface of that market. Pump penetration in that market is in the low single digits, maybe the mid-single digits. And the Omnipod platform has a right to win in that market because of its simplicity and its channel access and et cetera.  And the other third thing I'd point to is that we know that GLP-1 class of drugs has long coexisted with insulin. We saw that in our own type 2 feasibility trial, which we published 2 ATTDs ago. A lot of that population that used Omnipod 5 in that trial was already also using. That was an all-comer study in terms of the population. And many, many of those patients who were using GLP-1s has still got great benefit from the Omnipod 5 in that trial. So we're very confident that we have a huge market of people who need our help with our Omnipod platform and when we get the label of Omnipod 5. And we don't see the GLP-1s changing our TAM. Operator : Our next question comes from Malgorzata Kaczor from William Blair. Malgorzata Kaczor : I wanted to go a little bit deeper into the guidance on the U.S. I know I appreciate your comments to Larry. But the midpoint of the guide, obviously, is quite sizable relative to the beat this quarter, and you listed a variety of benefits.  But can you give us just a rough sense, on a percentage basis, how meaningful each of those impacts is to the guidance range? And then whether you're seeing kind of some more meaningful, I guess, sequential increases in new patient adds that maybe is atypical for a traditional Insulet year? Wayde McMillan : Okay. Margaret, I can start that one off and just give you a little bit more insight to how we think about the guidance, the first part of your question related to the impact of the guide. Depending on high end or low end, the headwind from the tough comp in last year's Omnipod 5 ramp benefits in Q3 and Q4, between a 5% and 10% headwind to our guidance range. But really, the reason we have confidence in still being at 30% growth at the high end and continuing to grow at these accelerated rates is the result of our durable business model and the annuity factor.  And so we've had record new customer starts for several quarters, which gives us momentum into the second half here. And we're going to continue to build momentum. The high end of our range assumes we'll continue to see record level new customer starts. And given the momentum that we have today, we've got high confidence in doing that. So those are really the major factors.  As we called out in our prepared remarks, we see stable attrition and utilization, so we're assuming that continues at the high end as well. We don't see any major impact to attrition or utilization. A couple of other things to think about in the second half is we've had a good contribution to the premium moving into the pharmacy channel by converting a lot of our existing customers from the DME channel. We'll still continue to get that benefit. That benefit has grown each quarter as we've moved more and more volume into the pharmacy channel.  And again, as we said in our prepared remarks, 90% of our volume is now in the pharmacy channel, so a significant increase from this time last year. So that premium is benefiting us here and will continue to benefit us in the second half, but it will be to a lesser extent because we're starting to reduce the number of converting customers each quarter.  And as you recall, we have planned to be through most of our existing customers converting to Omnipod 5 in the pharmacy channel through the end of this year. We think most of those conversions will be done by the end of '23, and we think that will wane and, to a lesser extent, be a benefit here in the second half. So those are the major changes when you look at the growth rate. But again, we are a volume business and, by far, the largest contributor to our growth rate is our volume growth, which is based on our customer base growing. And we continue to see that growing with new customer starts throughout the second half of this year again. So strong guide, strong momentum in the business, lots of tailwinds to help us continue here based on our annuity model. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Pasquale from Nephron Research. Christopher Pasquale : Congrats on the quarter. I wanted to talk a little bit about the International business and the O5 rollout there. Curious how much of your current international footprint U.K. and Germany represents. And I understand the comment about the installed base model and it taking some time to flow through, but if we just look at the U.S. example, the Omnipod 5 launch led to a pretty immediate growth inflection. So why couldn't we see something earlier than back half of next year outside the U.S.? James Hollingshead : Thanks, Chris. I'll start with that one and then maybe Wayde will provide some color. So we're really excited about the Omnipod 5 launch in the U.K. It's going really well. I'll just share 1 story with you.  There's so much pent-up demand for Omnipod 5 across our European markets and all of our markets. And one of the clinics we work really closely with was -- had so many customers waiting to get on therapy. They actually put up decorations all over their office and put up a disco glitter ball as they brought people in to get set up on therapy. It was a huge celebration. And as we said in our prepared remarks, our order rate has doubled. So it's off to a great start in the U.K. We're really excited about Germany. As to the percentages, we haven't broken those out. I don't think you'd find them materially different from a lot of medtech markets, but we haven't materially -- we haven't broken out those specific numbers for the markets. In terms of the growth in the U.S. versus the growth in European markets, every market is a little bit different. One of the reasons, maybe the main reason we had such an effect on anticipated growth with Omnipod 5 in the U.S., it was all of the customer sources in the U.S. were at the high end or above the high end of our expectations, and that's because of the pharmacy channel. So in most of the European markets, customers who are on a therapy are locked into a contract. And in the U.S., if you're locked into a contract with your tubed pump, you can cross over into a pharmacy benefit. And so that's what -- that's in the U.S., what's allowed us to have so many competitive conversions in our new customer starts.  In the European markets, it's a little different everywhere, but it's less flexible for patients who are on a therapy. So they have to typically wait for their contract to come up. So therefore, most of our new customer starts are customers who are new to therapy and were getting some upgrades from our own products. And then we'll be bringing in new customer starts who are converting, but they're converting in that whatever the annual cycle is, whether it's a 4-year cycle, in some markets, it's a 5-year cycle. So when they come available, they're really relevant targets for us to move off of competitive pumps. But that just changes. It changes the dynamic of the flow. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Baird. Jeffrey Johnson : Wayde, maybe I think we're all trying to kind of feel you out, obviously, on U.S. growth rates for next year, and I know you're not guiding to next year. But a couple of the moving pieces that you talked about this quarter, that reduction in channel inventory of $13 million, the $7 million in returns. How much of that do you think is left to play out, to go away as a headwind maybe as we get deeper into this year and heading into next year? And then I know you keep calling out every quarter this patient behavior of doubling up and getting maybe 4 months of inventory in a 3-month period when you first start O5. But that behavior has stayed pretty consistent now for the better part of the year, so it doesn't seem like there's a whole lot of change going on there. So to me, it almost feels like this net kind of neutralizing of those 2 factors should drop away on the headwind side and maybe you keep a little bit of that tailwind. So I guess my point on all that is you seem to be guiding to about 25% growth in the U.S. Omnipod business for the back half of this year. Obviously, a very strong number against that low to mid-40% comps. Is that crazy to think that could be a starting-off point on how we think of next year as you get the tough comps? You maybe get a little bit less of that premium upgrade from DME to pharmacy, but you also get a little drop-off of those headwinds that I was talking about? Wayde McMillan : Jeff, happy to talk about guidance a little bit more here and certainly a lot of dynamics moving, and you've called out several of them. So why don't we just touch on them -- each of them again and make sure it's clear. So as we think about the days inventory on hand, and I'm glad you brought that one up, because it is something that we obviously don't have control over the distribution channel. And we are seeing the pharmacy channel be more efficient. And so maybe just to summarize what we've seen to date with Omnipod 5. In Q2 of last year, we saw a $7 million inventory build and so it was a bit of a headwind for us this quarter. And then we saw really stable inventory days. We've estimated pretty stable inventory days up until last quarter when we saw a reduction in days inventory on hand.  And we thought that, that was pretty settled out at that point. But then we again saw days inventory on hand, a few days reduction again this quarter. So we're curious to see if this is where the pharmacy distribution channel settles out, or if they're down a couple of days and we'll see that come back. But we don't factor that into our guidance going forward because we can't predict it. So days inventory in hand from here, we don't know. However, we do see it trending a few days lower than we have seen over the past several quarters. And so there is potential that we could see some of that come back. You mentioned the 2 scripts. Again, this was another dynamic that we were curious to see how it would play out.  As you said, on the growth side of it or the total benefit side of it, we have seen a pretty consistent benefit. But remember, over half of that benefit has been the result of converting Omnipod customers from DASH and our Classic Omnipod on to Omnipod 5. And that is starting to ramp down here in the second half, and we're expecting to be through most of that in 2023. So interesting enough, the last 2 quarters, that benefit has been more than offset by the days inventory in hand reductions as well as some are increase to our returns reserve. And so we haven't really seen it as a total net benefit because those dynamics all basically wash each other out.  So to your point, if we don't see any more increases in return reserves, and we don't expect that we will, and we don't see any changes to days inventory in hand, we would assume we'll continue to see a 2 script benefit moving forward, but to a much lesser extent as we move into 2024. So all those things together, Jeff, we still think that the largest part of our growth, by far, is going to be the new customer start metric.  And at consistent attrition and utilization rates, it really is a volume business. And that's what we would highlight for you and others here is really focused on those new customer starts, the growing customer base and how we accelerate volume from here. And that's what gives us confidence to be even with these pretty strong tough comps in the second half, to be guiding at 30% at the high end of our range. Operator : Our next question comes from Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. Doyle Shell : This is Glenn Shell on for Jayson. And I just had a quick question with regard to moving the Omnipod Classic users to Omnipod 5. Where are we in that conversion? And are you seeing higher attrition from the Omnipod Classic as it's discontinued? Wayde McMillan : Yes, Glenn. Sure, happy to start this one, Glenn. So we are through most of the Omnipod Classic exchange to either DASH or Omnipod 5 in the U.S. And so we have announced in the U.S. that our plan is to move our customers and discontinue the product in the U.S. Having said that, we're going to wait and see where we're at by the end of the year to make a final determination there. Obviously, we're going to take care of all of our Omnipodders, our customers that had been with us for some time. But they've got great options to move to DASH and Omnipod 5. Given the coverage levels that we have in the pharmacy channel now for both DASH and Omnipod 5, it is a lot easier for our former Omnipod Classic customers to move on to DASH.  And so we are not seeing a higher attrition rate. In fact, our early estimates show us that our converting customers are staying with the product and really either Classic to DASH or Classic to Omnipod 5. In both cases, we've seen that at accelerated rates and the attrition has been really strong. Operator : Our next question comes from Travis Steed from Bank of America. Travis Steed : A quick clarification, Wayde. When I put up all the numbers that you gave in adjustments, I got to like 48% U.S. growth. Just wanted to clarify that number to make sure that was right, what I accounted for all the adjustments.  And then on the Q4 guide, it looks like if you look at the Q4 implied guide, you're somewhere around 20% U.S. growth. Is that the right way to think about the starting point for 2024 and next year as you think about lapping some of the tougher comps? Wayde McMillan : Travis, I wasn't quite tracking with you on which quarter for the 48%. But you may be thinking about the net headwind of $4 million, which just adds a couple of percentage basis points on a normalized basis to this quarter. So it does benefit us. I think that's the direction you're heading is we do get a benefit because of that net headwind this quarter. And I guess if you're adding in the tough comp for the second half, that also benefits us. But maybe what I would focus on out of your question was just the implied guide for Q4. So of course, we don't guide to Q4 at this point. We just do Q3 and Q4.  But in that implied guide, you should be near 30% at the high end of the range. And that's our expectation is that, given the strong momentum in the business here, we have 30% at the high end of the range for Q3 and close to 30% in the range for the implied Q4 as well. Thanks, Travis. Operator : Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from Citigroup. Joanne Wuensch : I'm a little bit curious about the timing of the iOS application, the integration with G7 and the integration with L2. And what do you think -- once those next steps come along, what you think the benefit may be to the franchise? James Hollingshead : Thanks, Joanne. We're really excited about all 3 of those programs. And as you know, as we said in the prepared remarks and we said at ADA, the iOS app is filed with the FDA. And so we're waiting clearance there and then we'll be prepping for launch as soon as we can, as soon as we practically can. So really excited about that, very requested feature. It's interesting. On that one, specifically, there are a lot of customers out there in Omnipod 5 who have made the decision to not pull back. And so when I talk to physicians when I'm out in the field, there's a lot of patients who are carrying their controller and their phone. They just -- they want to not have to carry both. And so that's a big requested feature.  Having said that, there -- I'm sure there are some people who are waiting for iOS to come on to Omnipod 5. So it's hard for us to estimate what that is, but we do think that will give us a boost, and it'll certainly be a big customer satisfier for us and certainly help us to continue with such great retention rates and customer experience. So we're really bullish on that. With the 2 -- with G7 and with the FreeStyle, with our 2 partners, Abbott and Dexcom and FreeStyle family of sensors, obviously, we're working hard, working really well with both of them, great collaboration with both of them. We want to get on -- we want to get to a sensor of choice just as quickly as we can and the programs are proceeding really, really well.  As you know, we don't forecast timings or talk about that -- talk about timings for those things. But it's obvious we have to be fairly far along with FreeStyle Libre 2 to be embarking on that study we're doing in the U.K. We're very bullish on that. But the partnership with both of them goes really well, and we're working hard to get those to market as quickly as we can. And we think that both of them provide a boost for us. Obviously, when you think about G7, it's off to a very quick launch and is a good -- a really good customer experience. And when you think about the FreeStyle Libre family of sensors, very, very well positioned, particularly in other geographies. And so we think they provide sustained growth for us, and they provide a great customer experience for us to be able to provide that kind of choice as quickly as we can to our customers. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Lichtman from Oppenheimer. Steven Lichtman : On the HCP prescriber increase, I thought the sequential increase was notable. Can you talk about what you're seeing that's driving that prescriber expansion? Is it use of Omnipod 5 in type 2 even before formal labeling there? And are you calling on these HCPs or is this sort of more organic? James Hollingshead : Thanks, Steve. Yes, we're really heartened to see that. I think that there are a number of things driving it. The first one is Omnipod 5 is just so accessible as a product and as an experience. And we're seeing increasing confidence with the writing of prescriptions for Omnipod 5 across the whole range of HCPs.  So you'll see endocrinologists and physicians writing the scripts. You'll see nurse practitioners, physician extenders, physician assistants writing those scripts. So it's very broad. And it's because of the ease of use of Omnipod 5, it's an easy thing to write for. And that's what we're seeing in the expansion of our prescribing population. And I'll tell you, the interest is really robust all across the board.  And so just as an example, our team was just down in Houston over the weekend at the ADCES conference, which is the conference for diabetes educators. And we just had phenomenal interest in the product platforms and in Omnipod 5. All of our workshops and showcases were sort of standing room-only attendance beyond what was like better -- bigger than the room space kind of attendance. And that just demonstrates the broad reach and the ease of use of the Omnipod 5 product, which is, of course, a huge advantage for us. Because the Pod platform, the product experience is so easy compared to our tubed pump competitors, and that's why we're seeing the expansion of prescribers in the market. Wayde McMillan : And Jim, I can pick up on the type 2 part of Steve's question as well. As you saw in our reported results here, type 2 making up 20% of our new customer starts, and that's a tick-up from what we've seen in the last 3 quarters. We've been running in at 15% to 20%. And so with a record new customer start quarter, we are still seeing good new customer starts. That is partially driven by DASH. But as you said, HCPs are writing for type 2. We cannot market for type 2 yet. As you know, we do not have the label. And so we don't condone it by any means. And our team is working incredibly hard, as Jim touched on in his prepared remarks, to get our type 2 pivotal trial for Omnipod 5 completed and submit that to the FDA so that we can get on label and start to market type 2 for -- or Omnipod 5 for type 2 patients. And so it is certainly core to our strategy. And a lot of people with diabetes with type 2 that we would like to bring Omnipod 5 to, and we're certainly working as hard as we can to do that. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Jennings from TD Cowen. Joshua Jennings : I wanted to just ask about segment of the new patient starts and just on competitive pump conversions. Do you have any data on those conversions being end-of-warranty conversions versus middle-of-warranty conversions and how that's trending? And then potentially, just how are you thinking about a direct-to-consumer campaign for Omnipod 5? Any historic successes with DTCs in the past as a reference would be helpful, too. Wayde McMillan : Sure. Josh, I can start with that one on the new customer start question and pass it to Jim for an update on our DTC or direct-to-consumer strategy. So we continue to see strong competitive conversions. Although the mix has changed in our reported numbers somewhat, the total number of competitive conversions continues to be strong and certainly elevated above the levels that we saw before Omnipod 5.  And so we don't break out the specific numbers for you there about -- like we don't actually track from them whether they're in warranty or not in warranty. That's just not part of our data set. We just know customers that tell us if they're converting from a competitive pump or not. So we don't have that insight for you, Josh, even to give any color on in-warranty or out-of-warranty. We make estimates, but it would be too much of a stretch to try to quantify that.  And then, Jim, maybe a little bit on our DTC strategy? James Hollingshead : Yes. Thanks for the question, Josh. DTC is a very effective tool for us, and we're really confident that we have a strong return on investment in our DTC program. One thing that I'll just flag is that DTC doesn't just mean TV for us, right? We have a very robust mix of the way we reach out to customers and consumers, and that includes social. It includes what is called over-the-top or streaming media. It will include more broadcast TV. And it includes influencers. We have a really active campaign with influencers and so on. And we have a really good sense of which levers to pull and so on. And I'm very confident in what our team is able to produce, and we're getting really good at dialing it up and down based upon the results. And so you'll continue to see us doing DTC campaigns. You might periodically see us ramp up on TV as we feel like we need to, but we have a very broad mix and a very effective approach to it. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew O'Brien from Piper Sandler. Matthew O'Brien: I know we're getting a little late here. Just Wayde or Jim, just as you talk about the key growth drivers for the business being on the volume side, if I think back -- I think it was 3 or 4 quarters ago, 60-40 was the split between MDI and conversions and then 70-30, I think, last quarter, now 75-25. So what I'm asking for, and I know the denominator is getting a lot bigger, but are you seeing any kind of slowdown in your ability to convert competitive pumpers right now? And I don't know if it's because of Medtronic being in the market or something like that. And then it seems like the enthusiasm for O5 from the MDI patient population is as strong, if not stronger, than this time last year when you first launched it, is that fair? Just maybe talk about the trajectory of those 2 groups of patients. James Hollingshead : Thanks, Matt. We're not seeing any kind of pause in the enthusiasm for Omnipod 5, and we continue to garner a lot of competitive conversions from both of our tubed pump competitors. And so the patient demand is really strong. Physician demand is really strong. And it's across all age groups really interestingly.  And so no pause, great positioning. And I've already forgotten the second half of your question. Can you repeat the second half of your question for me? Wayde McMillan : Yes. I think it was just -- go ahead, Matt. Matthew O'Brien: Sorry, the enthusiasm around O5 within MDIs, is it even stronger? James Hollingshead : Within MDI? Yes. If anything, the enthusiasm is even stronger. We're seeing record new customer starts. We're seeing the percentage mix is changing more because of MDI on the top, right? And so I think we're just so well positioned, and we're not -- the momentum for the business is terrific, and Omnipod 5 is just very, very broadly adopted and accepted. I'll give you an example. I was just out in the field last week, and I was in a pediatric clinic sitting with a physician who's been writing for us and for one of our main competitors for a long time. And she said to me, \"Listen, Omnipod 5 is so good. But at this point, I'm not writing really for your competitive pump, unless somebody specifically asks for it. And not just that, but everybody I've converted from the competitor pump on Omnipod 5 just does better.\" And I started to probe around why and the details, so they just do better. They just have better outcomes, they have a better experience. And so I think that's a really good sign for us in terms of how the learning curve of the market. Here, a year in, I think the market has learned a lot about Omnipod 5, how easy to see is what kind of great real-world outcomes it's driving. And we just see a ton of momentum across age groups and across all sources of customers, including MDI. Operator : Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Danielle Antalffy : Congrats on continuing to deliver really strong results here. Wayde, this question, I think, is for you. And it's, again, I appreciate you're not giving guidance for 2024. But just qualitatively, looking at the different potential tailwinds that could offset some of the headwinds from a comp perspective and the benefit from the 2 scripts for every new patients added in 2023. And just want to make sure we are thinking about these offsets correctly. So thinking -- appreciating not giving timing, but L2, G7 integration, [indiscernible], you have the GO. Like maybe walk us through qualitatively how to think about the headwinds and tailwinds that will be coming international from a tailwind perspective in 2024. Wayde McMillan : Yes. It's a great way to look at it, Danielle. And I think you're right. The tailwinds vastly outweigh the headwinds for next year. As we think about the business where we sit today after halfway through 2023, we've had really strong new customer starts for several quarters. So that gives us great momentum into the second half.  I think the answer to your question will lie in the second half. If we continue to see strong new customer starts, record new customer starts in the second half of this year, that will give us great momentum into next year. And then as you teed up there, we have a significant pipeline of new innovations teed up. We haven't given the timing on those, whether they'll be '23 or '24 or even beyond yet.  But as those new innovations start to layer in, and of course, with our annuity model, they don't have an immediate sizable increase but they do start to help us accrue more customers over time. And so we're going to continue to build momentum. On the other side of the coin, obviously, AID competition is really strong for us outside the U.S., on the international side. And so what we provided an update in our prepared remarks today is that as a result of lower new customer starts than we usually had internationally, we've got lower growth rates to contend with there for the next 4 quarters. So that you can see our guide for the second half for international, and that will continue into the first half of '24. But given Omnipod 5 launching internationally, and we're going to add more countries next year, we expect the second half to start to inflect internationally. And so now we've moved into the mid- to low single digits. We think the second half of next year should be approaching that high single digits, low double digits type of range.  And so again, we're not providing specific guidance. But that gives you a feel for what we think is really strong momentum for the U.S. and improving positioning as we'll be able to compete in the AID side of the market internationally better at the end of this year and into next year. And then as that builds into the annuity model, we'll see an inflecting growth rate in the second half of 2024 internationally. So with all that in, again, it's such a dynamic launch here. We know it's going to be strong. We just don't know how strong, and so we can't provide numbers at this point. We'll typically give some color at the end of the Q3 call on what we're seeing going into 2024, and then we'll provide our guidance like we do every year for 2024 at the end of the Q4 call. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from Jefferies. Michael Sarcone : This is Mike Sarcone on for Matt. I just had a question on Omnipod GO. Can you just talk about what's left to do commercially ahead of the full market release in 2024? And maybe comment on how you're thinking about the financial contribution next year. James Hollingshead : Sure. I'll start on the pilot plan and then I'll let Wayde talk about financial contribution. So we're really bullish on getting that market out in the hands of our pilot physicians and clinics. And the great thing about GO is that it solves a lot of problems for people who are initiating insulin therapy, as we said before. It resolved the needle phobia. It resolves dosing and so on. But it's new to world and it's new for us and it's new for those clinics because some of those clinics are places where we don't necessarily have a very strong call point footprint. And so what we need to do is get it out in the clinics. We need to go out and educate the clinics on the use of GO, which is incredibly simple experience. And we need to kind of test the waters with a couple of things about the dosing SKUs and some other things. So we need to see it in the real world, in the hands of the clinics, in the hands of our reps and make sure we just have -- we have the approach to the selling pitch correct, make sure we understand how to support the clinics that we're going into and so on. And we're giving ourselves time because it's a new-to-world offer and it's a new -- and there's some things about it that are kind of new commercial model for us. And so that's why we're saying we're going to pilot it here in the near term. We're going to learn what we learn, give ourselves some time to adjust and then commercialize in 2024.  And Wayde, if you want to talk about what we're modeling for financial impact. Wayde McMillan : Yes. So Matt, we would love to know where Omnipod GO is going to go in 2024. We have many financial scenarios internally. But as Jim just said, we're going to take our time. We want to do this right. It's a new-to-world product, and so it's really difficult to know how fast Omnipod GO will ramp. We've obviously got the limited market release. As Jim said this year, we're going to learn a lot there and that's going to help us start to dial in our models for 2024. But I think at this point, I would say really thinking about Omnipod GO as a light contributor to our 2024 growth rates. And let's just give it some time to see how fast it does ramp. And when it starts to become a material contributor, that's when we certainly will start to layer it into our guidance, and we'll talk about more of it from a financial contribution standpoint. But until then, just given the new-to-world concept, we're not going to be communicating financial numbers for it at this time. Operator : And we have time for one last question, it will come from Matt Miksic from Barclays. Matthew Miksic : Just one maybe on that on the Omnipod question. That's just -- maybe as you build inventories, is that something that we'd expect to go up in any of your sort of days inventory numbers. Understanding that it's a pilot launch, but I'm sure you want to be prepared for demand to pick up. And I'll just leave it at that last follow-up. Wayde McMillan : You bet, Matt. It's Wayde. I can certainly take that one, and it is something that our teams are working through today. And in fact, we're going to learn a lot through this limited market release. One of the key things or key learnings that we're working on is what is the optimal staging or building of inventory in the channel to support the GO launches. But I think just qualitatively, you're right. Just like with Omnipod 5, we're going to have enough inventory in the channel to serve the customers. And so like we saw in Q2 last year, when we did the limited market release for Omnipod 5, we called out a days inventory-on-hand build for Omnipod 5. Assuming the same plays out for Omnipod GO, we'll let you guys know if there's a material amount of inventory that has to go into the channel to launch with Omnipod GO. But nonetheless, it's an exciting program. The teams internally are really excited to see how the limited market releases go. We're going to learn a lot. There's certainly a very large market, an underserved market that needs better technology. We are the natural owner. We've got many benefits with Omnipod and our auto-injection as well as our fluid mechanics. And I think the teams have done a really nice job of simplifying the Omnipod for this group of customers. And so we'll see how the limited market releases go. We'll have probably a lot more to say after that as we start to get into more of a full market release in 2024. Operator : I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back to Jim Hollingshead. James Hollingshead : Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We are incredibly proud of the milestones we've achieved and the progress we've made. And thanks to our disruptive offerings and dedicated team who worked further along than our original expectations and setting our sights higher than ever before. Insulet has come a long way, and we are energized by the enormous market opportunity we are pursuing and the opportunity to drive rapid growth and substantial value for Insulet shareholders while fulfilling our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes around the world. We look forward to continuing to update you on our progress over the year and next quarter. Thank you all for joining, and have a great evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Deborah Gordon, Vice President Investor Relations. Deborah Gordon : Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for Insulet's third quarter 2023 earnings call. With me today are Jim Hollingshead, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Lauren Budden, our Interim Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Both the replay of this call and the press release discussing our quarterly results and our guidance will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Also on our website is our third quarter supplemental earnings presentation. We encourage you to reference that document for a summary of key metrics and business updates. Before we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such statements. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely adjusted gross and operating margins, adjusted EBITDA and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth excluding the effect of foreign exchange. These measures align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance and we believe they are helpful to investors, analysts and other interested parties as measures of our operating performance from period to period. Additionally, unless otherwise stated all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis with the exception of revenue growth rates, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim. Jim Hollingshead : Thanks Deb. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Q3 was another strong quarter for Insulet with rapid growth and achievement of many strategic milestones. Thanks to our global team's execution, dedication and focus we are on track to complete another transformational year and enter 2024 with significant momentum. On today's call, I want to do three things; discuss our financial results and market traction provide an update on our continuing progress in clinical and market access work, and review key developments in our innovation pipeline. Our third quarter revenue exceeded our expectations with total Omnipod growth of over 27% including US growth of 35%. We also achieved total company growth of 25%. These are remarkable results especially coming in the context of our strong prior year comparables. As a result, we raised guidance once again for the full year. Performance was driven primarily by the huge success of Omnipod 5, our revolutionary automated insulin delivery system. It is gratifying to see the positive impact Omnipod 5 is having as it continues to simplify and improve the lives of people with diabetes and we are only in the early innings. Q3 represented the anniversary of the US launch of our Omnipod 5 platform. Omnipod 5 is the only FDA-cleared fully disposable pod-based AID system and it continues to transform diabetes management. Its simplicity, ease of use, widespread and affordable access and improved real-world outcomes have made Omnipod 5, the leading AID offering on the market. With the added benefits of US pharmacy channel access pay-as-you-go model and an easy onboarding pathway, Omnipod 5 makes it simple and efficient for health care practitioners, patients and payers to conveniently prescribe access and afford our breakthrough technology. We are now also beginning the global rollout of Omnipod 5 in our international markets starting with the UK this past June. With one full quarter under our belts in the UK we are seeing very strong early adoption. In Q3, Omnipod 5 drove accelerated new customer starts in the UK taking revenue growth to almost 45% year-over-year and driving approximately 70% sequential growth in new customer starts. It's a strong early sign of the global power of Omnipod 5 to transform diabetes care. During Q3, we also commenced the rollout of Omnipod 5 in Germany in August and early momentum is exciting. Based on these results, we are confident that Omnipod 5 will emerge as the market-leading offer everywhere it is available. The success of Omnipod 5 led to another outstanding quarter of new customer starts both in the US and globally. In the US, Omnipod 5 continue to represent the vast majority of our new customer starts in Q3 and customer retention remains strong. In the US in Q3, Omnipod new customer starts coming from multiple daily injections and legacy tubed pumps was an estimated 80-20 percentage split which is in line with our historical mix. Omnipod was specifically designed for individuals on MDI and as expected, we are driving pump penetration across all age groups in both the Type 1 and Type 2 markets, while also growing our share positioning Insulet as a leader in these markets. We estimate that we are the clear leader bringing customers into the market from MDI. In addition to growing awareness of Omnipod and high product demand among patients, a growing number of HCPs are writing scripts for it. In Q3, we saw another increase in prescribers growing to over 17,000 up from over 15,000 in Q2. In a market where there are 7,000 to 8,000 endocrinologists this shows the broad appeal and ease of prescription of Omnipod 5. Importantly, this extensive reach is critical to access patients who are not seen at the high-volume pump-prescribing clinics that historically defines the pump market. Omnipod 5's broad appeal is also evidenced by the growing number of scripts that these HCPs write for our system. Omnipod loyalty amongst Podders has been a hallmark of our brand for many years and it is great to see the growing demand and confidence amongst the prescribing HCPs. In fact an increasing number tell us that when given the choice their patients overwhelmingly choose Omnipod. Our results in Q3 also strengthen our conviction that we'll be able to reach the millions of people with Type 2 diabetes who need insulin therapy as a part of their care. In the quarter, Omnipod adoption in the Type 2 market continued at a steady pace with Type 2 patients representing approximately 20% of our US new customer starts. These new customer starts come from across our Omnipod portfolio of products, demonstrating the clear benefits that our products offer the Type 2 population. Omnipod DASH continues to be the leading insulin pump offer with an indication for use in the Type 2 market. While we can't yet market Omnipod 5 for Type 2, the obvious underlying demand for AID in the Type 2 market is encouraging. And we look forward to bringing Omnipod 5 to these customers once we complete our pivotal trial and secure an extension to our existing indication for use. And to that end, we are very excited to announce that we have reached our enrollment goal this week in our US Type 2 pivotal study. As a reminder, this is a study of up to 400 participants with a 13-week protocol comparing Omnipod 5 to participants' previous therapy. The feedback from HCPs and study participants continues to be very strong and strengthens our confidence that Omnipod 5 will have a big impact in the critically underserved population of Type 2 patients who require insulin. We will provide further updates as the trial progresses. I'd like to make a few comments about the ongoing debate about the impact of GLP-1s on our markets. As we've made clear, we regard the GLP-1 class of drugs as an important innovation for people with Type 2 diabetes and they have been indicated for use in Type 2 diabetes for several years. These drugs help many of the same patients we aim to help and we applaud their innovation. Further as a reminder, we believe GLP-1s do not materially impact our end markets. They are not indicated for use in Type 1 diabetes which is an autoimmune disorder and there is no apparent mechanism for them to impact the course of type one as a condition. Likewise, there is no apparent mechanism for GLP-1 drugs to alter the underlying progression of beta cell decline that is characteristic of Type 2 diabetes. Last month we published a short slide presentation going into these issues in more detail. This week we published an update to those slides based upon data that was recently presented at EASD. In a large retrospective study of 23,000 users of semaglutide, the evidence presented suggests three important conclusions. First, semaglutide has almost identical impact on glycemic control as liraglutide in terms of the magnitude and duration of A1c reduction. Second, this real-world evidence shows a very clear relationship between dose adherence and glycemic control such that only the most adherent users receive the level of benefit that has been demonstrated in more controlled clinical settings. Finally and importantly, weight loss and the persistence of weight loss for semaglutide users in this study was demonstrated to be independent of glycemic control. In short, real-world evidence shows that patients using semaglutide continue to have their diabetes progress with limited or no incremental duration of effect over previous drugs and type 2 diabetes continues to progress even with weight loss. For those who are interested in more detail, we refer you to our updated presentation which is available on the Insulet Investor page. These data reinforce our existing view. Because the underlying disease continues to progress most people with type 2 diabetes will eventually need to incorporate insulin into their therapy. Insulet is incredibly well-positioned to serve these customers as they progress in their condition and need to add first basal and then intensive insulin into their treatment. We are already winning in this market and we continue to have strong conviction that people with type 2 diabetes represent a large and underserved population. We are continuing our efforts to bring the full power of a broad portfolio of insulin delivery options including Omnipod DASH, Omnipod 5, and Omnipod GO, which I will come back to in a few moments. In addition to our type 2 pivotal trial, we are progressing several additional clinical initiatives. We are pleased to have completed the protocol with the last participant in our randomized controlled trial using Omnipod 5 with Dexcom's G6. We're in the process of analyzing and preparing the data, which we expect to show the clear benefits of Omnipod 5 therapy over non-AID systems. We are also making great progress with the RADIANT study which is our Libre 2 Integration trial, for which we began enrollment in September. Clinicians have remarked about the simplicity and ease of transition for MDI users to Omnipod 5 in the outpatient setting including in regions where it is often the norm for AID therapy to occur in the hospital for days due to the complexity of existing tubed pump offerings. We are excited that our integration with Abbott's Libre 2 sensor has advanced to the point where study participants are using the system. Both of these studies will provide the evidence we need to drive pricing and market access initiatives as we launch Omnipod 5 across our international markets. I'd now like to turn to three key areas of innovation for us; expanding the Omnipod 5 platform, moving upstream in the type 2 market with Omnipod GO, and driving the future of AID with our advanced algorithm program. The widespread success of Omnipod 5 makes it easy to forget that the current version of our offering is in some ways our minimum viable product. In order to achieve the full promise of the platform, our aim is to expand on customer choice, both for phone control and for CGM use. In that context, we are excited to have received FDA clearance for our 510(k) for the Omnipod iOS app. This is another major innovation milestone for Insulet and iOS is one of the most requested features from our customers. We are thrilled to have the opportunity to provide the iOS option to our existing Omnipod 5 customer base as well as future customers. Because the iOS app represents a completely new software platform we expect to begin a US limited market release in early 2024. And upon successful completion, we will make iOS for Omnipod 5 broadly available as soon as possible. With regard to CGM, our efforts to expand our sensor integrations with our partners, Dexcom and Abbott, continue to steadily progress. I've already mentioned our progress with Libre sensor integration in the context of our European trial. We are also hard at work to complete our integration with Dexcom's G7 sensor and we are excited to announce that we are planning for a limited market release of Omnipod 5 plus G7 also in early 2024. Omnipod 5 is the market-leading offer and with these coming innovations, we are confident we will be able to maintain and extend that leadership. A key innovation effort that moves us upstream from AID is Omnipod GO, which is designed to radically simplify the initiation of basal insulin therapy for people who need to start insulin as their type 2 diabetes progresses. Even small penetration into this market will meaningfully contribute to our long-term growth trajectory. We have commenced the commercial pilot for Omnipod GO in the US, which includes HCPs that we don't typically call on who are new to Omnipod most of whom who are primary care physicians. Our commercial pilot is providing us with the opportunity to present Omnipod GO and also to educate PCPs on all of our Omnipod offerings. Although early in our pilot, PCPs are telling us that Pod therapy is much easier than pump therapy. As a result these HCPs want to learn about the entire Omnipod portfolio. We expect both Omnipod GO and Omnipod DASH to make the treatment pathway far easier for these type 2 patients. Learnings from our ongoing Omnipod GO commercial, pilot will help us to refine our plans for commercialization in 2024. We are continuing to progress work on our next-generation AID algorithm with our Evolution feasibility trial which we began earlier in the year and which is being conducted in New Zealand. The goal of this feasibility study is to test potential enhancements to the Omnipod 5 algorithm in order to further drive simplicity of use. We've been able to launch this study very early in the life cycle of our AID offerings, specifically because of the unique aspects of Omnipod 5, both because the on-market algorithm is highly effective and because of our ability to gather actual usage data from essentially the entire population of Omnipod 5 users. We expect that cloud connectivity for -- of Omnipod 5 coupled with our data sciences capabilities will allow us to materially accelerate our algorithm development efforts over time. Finally, an important update on our intellectual property portfolio, which is a key asset enabling our continued growth. In August, we filed a suit in the US against EOFlow and other affiliated parties to stop the misappropriation of Insulet's proprietary trade secrets. Last month, after requesting preliminary relief and obtaining some initial evidence, the court granted our request for a preliminary injunction against EOFlow, which prohibits EOFlow from manufacturing marketing or selling to any new customer any product that we designed developed or manufactured using or relying on Insulet's trade secrets. The court also extended the prior injunction issue to restrain EOFlow from disclosing to any third party information that contains derives from or incorporates Insulet's confidential information. In granting Insulet's motion the court found \"very substantial indeed strong evidence of misappropriation\" and \"that Insulet is likely to succeed on the merits of its trade secrets claim.\" We have invested considerable resources over many years developing our Omnipod products and we are confident we have a clear lead technically and in terms of scalability. We will continue to vigorously defend our IP to protect those investments. In closing, we completed another outstanding quarter and we have sustained momentum across our business. We are enjoying continued rapid growth in the US type 1 market and we're seeing accelerating adoption in our international markets where Omnipod 5 is launched. We are also seeing continued growth in the type 2 market across our Omnipod offerings. We are excited about the catalysts coming in 2024 with iOS functionality CGM-integrated Omnipod GO that unlock a lot of market growth for many years to come. I want to thank our entire Insulet global team for their engagement and hard work as we continue to drive our mission to simplify life for the millions of people with diabetes around the world. Before I turn the call over to Lauren, I want to welcome and congratulate her on her role as our Interim CFO and Treasurer. Lauren is our Chief Accounting Officer and has been with Insulet for close to five years. She has long been a key member of our finance team and has contributed significant value to the company and to shareholders during her tenure with us. We are thrilled to have Lauren in this role to support our continued execution of our strategic priorities. With that, I will turn the call over to Lauren. Lauren Budden : Thanks so much, Jim. It's an honor to serve as interim CFO. As Jim shared, Insulin achieved another quarter of robust growth financial performance and strategic progress. We once again delivered strong global new customer starts fueled by huge demand for Omnipod 5 in the US. And we are seeing a very nice uptick in new customer starts in the international markets where we launched Omnipod 5. As a result of our growing customer base, we delivered 25% revenue growth in Q3, finishing above the high end of our guidance range. Our outperformance was driven by global Omnipod growth of over 27%. On a reported basis, for total revenue, foreign currency was a 180 basis point tailwind compared to Q3 last year. US Omnipod revenue growth was 35% and exceeded our guidance range. Revenue growth continues to be driven by our annuity-based model and growing US pharmacy volume. This includes an increase in volume contribution from Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH and the related premium for Pods in the US pharmacy. Pharmacy channel access continues to be a competitive advantage and we remain focused on driving increased volume through this channel, which in Q3 represented between 90% and 95% of our total US volume. Omnipod 5 ramp dynamics resulted in an estimated net tailwind of approximately $10 million, which is in line with what we expected for Q3 guidance. As a reminder, since our launch, we have realized a recurring net volume benefit from new customers as well as from Omnipod customers converting to Omnipod 5, many of whom received their starter kits and first refill orders in the quarter plus some initial stocking in retail pharmacies. Our estimates have been net of those Omnipod 5 customers who skipped an order in the period. In Q3, as we expected, the volume benefit from conversions has been normalizing and was therefore immaterial as the majority of our existing customers already switched to Omnipod 5. Going forward, we expect continued benefit from the two script dynamics, as we drive Omnipod 5 new customer starts. In Q3, US attrition and global utilization remained stable. International Omnipod revenue increased 8%, which was above our expectations. Growth was primarily driven by continued strong adoption of Omnipod DASH and to a smaller degree incremental benefit from our Omnipod 5 launch in the UK, which drove a notable increase in new customer starts. These benefits were partially offset by slightly higher attrition as we continue to be impacted by AID competition including lower distributor orders. On a reported basis, foreign currency was a 720 basis point tailwind over the prior year. Drug Delivery revenue declined 27%, which was slightly below our guidance range, due to a lower forecast from our partners. Gross margin was 67.8%, up over 1,200 basis points and included income of $1.9 million due to lower estimated costs associated with the medical device corrections we announced last year when we took a charge of approximately $37 million in Q3 last year. Excluding both, gross margin increased 120 basis points to 67.3% in Q3 of this year. This exceeded our expectations due to favorable manufacturing costs and higher-than-expected revenue. The year-over-year increase in adjusted gross margin was primarily driven by improved manufacturing efficiency and a premium from volume growth in the pharmacy channel. These increases were partially offset by expected higher production costs as US manufacturing continues to ramp and become a larger portion of our total production. Operating expenses were up year-over-year in line with our expectations as we invested in our business to support our strong growth trajectory. Adjusted operating margin was 12.2% and adjusted EBITDA was 19.1%. Both exclude the favorable medical device correction adjustment of $1.9 million and were above our expectations due to higher-than-anticipated revenue and gross margin. Turning to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with $685 million in cash and the full $300 million available under our credit facility. This strong financial position gives us the flexibility to invest in our innovation pipeline and other key areas of our organization in order to build on our foundation for long-term sustainable growth. Now turning to our 2023 outlook. For the full year, we are raising our expectations for total Omnipod revenue growth to a range of 29% to 30% and total company revenue growth to a range of 26% to 27%. For US Omnipod, we are increasing our revenue growth outlook to a range of 37% to 38%. This increase is primarily driven by continued strong Omnipod 5 adoption stemming from consecutive strong new customer starts and to a lesser extent ongoing conversions from other Omnipod products as well as from recurring revenue from Omnipod DASH and the benefits of our pay-as-you-go model in the pharmacy channel. As a reminder, Q4 of last year was the first full quarter of Omnipod 5 sales contributing to a tougher comparison in the fourth quarter of this year. The prior year included the two-script benefit, which was in large part due to the accelerated pace of customer conversions in the second half of 2022. It also included retail channel stocking. For International Omnipod, we are raising the low end of our guidance range and now expect 9% to 10% growth. On a reported basis we estimate a favorable foreign currency impact of approximately 100 basis points. We expect growth will be driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption as well as the benefit from our Omnipod 5 launches in the UK and Germany partially offset by AID competitive headwinds. As a reminder, given the nature of our annuity model we expect Omnipod 5 to more meaningfully contribute to our growth rate in the second half of 2024. For Drug Delivery, we are reaffirming our guidance range of a 45% to 50% decline. Turning to 2023 gross margin. We are raising our adjusted gross margin expectations to a range of 66% to 67% and expect to achieve the midpoint of this range. The increase from our prior guide is driven by improved manufacturing costs as well as higher-than-expected revenue including favorable mix. Although certain headwinds that we experienced during 2023 will carry over into next year, we expect to see further gross margin improvement in 2024. We now expect adjusted operating margin in the range of 9% to 10% given our revenue and gross margin outperformance. We remain committed to margin expansion and anticipate leveraging our investments in 2024 and beyond. Turning to our fourth quarter 2023 revenue guidance. We expect total Omnipod and total company growth of 22% to 25%. For US Omnipod, we expect growth of 28% to 31%. Even with the challenging comp due to the Omnipod 5 full market release in August of last year our new customers start momentum and the benefits of our annuity model continue to fuel our revenue growth, including strong expected sequential dollar growth in Q4. For International Omnipod, we expect growth of 5% to 8%. On a reported basis, we estimate a favorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 300 basis points. Finally, we expect Q4 Drug Delivery revenue to be approximately $3 million to $5 million due to timing of production and orders. We have sustained momentum across our business and we are poised for another strong year in 2024. While we will provide formal 2024 guidance on our Q4 call in February, I will provide some color now on how we are thinking about 2024 given the strong momentum we see in the business. We anticipate another year of large dollar growth in 2024, even with the significant volume benefits realized in 2023 from our Omnipod 5 ramp. For US Omnipod, we expect a growth rate within the mid-20% range, fueled by Omnipod 5 and its strong pace of new customer starts as well as our annuity model and pharmacy channel access. For International, we expect continued growth with Omnipod DASH and more meaningful growth towards the second half of the year from our recent Omnipod 5 launches in the UK and Germany. We expect continued headwinds in the countries where we do not yet have Omnipod 5 to partially offset this growth. All in, that puts us somewhere in the high single digits for the year with the second half of the year accelerating to a range of high single digits to low double-digits. For Drug Delivery, we expect to see a decline and at the high end of the forecast, we expect the decline to be lower than in 2023. In conclusion, we delivered another quarter of solid financial performance and we further positioned Insulet for continued momentum through the end of this year and beyond. As we continue to capitalize on the global market opportunity and invest in innovation, we're poised for another strong year of customer base growth and revenue growth. Opportunities of this magnitude are few and far between, and we are very well positioned to drive long-term value creation for our shareholders. With that, operator, please open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Rohan [ph] on for Robbie. Congrats on a really nice quarter. So there are several exciting developments you outlined on deck for 2024 just between CGM integration iOS launch and continued international expansion. And thanks for providing that color on those preliminary targets for next year as well. But my question is more related to how we should think about the growth contribution from each of these tailwinds next year and the puts and takes and what's assumed in those preliminary targets that you outlined? Thanks. Jim Hollingshead : Thanks Rohan. We're really excited about the growth catalysts that we have coming. We've obviously got great momentum continuing to drive really strong demand and new customer starts in the market really well positioned. And we're very excited about getting into the limited market releases for both iOS and G7 early in the year and also really excited about continuing progress with the Libre integration. So we think they do drive continued growth for us. And in terms of the guide we haven't really guided on the number for that. It's really in our color. But we do think it opens up a lot of potential growth for us across the board. They're all important. And I wouldn't want to necessarily weigh one over the other so we think they all drive catalyst. But I'll ask Lauren and Deb if they want to add any color to that. Lauren Budden : Sure. Thanks, Jim. So yes we have factored them in. But given our annuity model as Jim said it's not expected to be a meaningful contribution. And we're just entering in LMR in the beginning of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Charles [ph] on for Larry. First congrats on the nice quarter. And I just wanted to ask I don't know if you said this already. Did you say new patient starts were a record worldwide? Did I hear that right? And then I got a quick follow-up. Jim Hollingshead : New customer starts were really strong not quite a record. And so second we're not we don't want to get in the table ranking all of our quarters all the time, but it was our second-highest quarter ever of new customer starts just coming in behind. Q2 was kind of a blowout quarter for us in new customer starts where everything hit on every cylinder. So really happy with the new customer starts, but not quite a record. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up. Wondering if you might be able to give an update on the search for a new CFO. What exactly are you looking for there? And I wonder if you could give a possible time line you might hope to have an announcement there. Jim Hollingshead : Sure Charles. First of all we're really happy to have Lauren in the chair. She's been with us for a long time. She's such a great contributor to the company and to our senior finance team and really blessed to have somebody of Lauren's caliber to step in in this interim. And we're conducting a search. We're just out of the market now with the search. We've written the spec. And I don't really want to talk about the characteristics and so on that we're looking for. We think that the CFO job here is a really fun job. We have internal candidates who are really strong including Lauren and early look at the market looks really promising. We want to move as quickly as we can because we want to get to some stability there. But we're very confident we'll get the right person in the role. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephanie Piazzola from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Stephanie Piazzola : Hi. Congrats on a good quarter. I wanted to ask more about margins, which were really strong in the quarter and throughout the year have been showing improvement each quarter. So appreciate the revenue color you gave on 2024. But if there's any color you could share on margins for next year that would be helpful, maybe any of the puts and takes to consider there? Thank you. Lauren Budden : Yeah. So\u2026 Jim Hollingshead : Thanks Stephanie. I'll turn to Lauren on that. Go ahead. Sorry Lauren. Go ahead, go ahead. Lauren Budden : So we're not providing guidance today. But just a little colour we are committed to expanding our margins. We're thrilled that we increased gross margins for the full year of 2023 to 66% to 67%. And we are also very thrilled that we increased the high-end of our operating margin guidance range as well. So we're very focused on increasing those and we would expect that trend to continue going forward as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. Good afternoon. This is Jayson on for Jayson. So big picture have the physician or user discussions changed with greater GLP adoption? I'm just wondering, if you changed your marketing strategy in any way? And then just quickly as a related follow-up can we assume that the year-over-year growth in new Type 2 users was higher than your overall U.S. Omnipod growth? Thanks. Jim Hollingshead : Hi Jayson. [Indiscernible] So yeah, no we haven't changed our marketing message at all. The Omnipod 5 Pod and Omnipod DASH are so effective in insulin delivery. The pilot with The Omnipod 5 Pod though is -- we're learning a lot. It's going well. And GLP-1s are out there. GLP-1 has been indicated for some time in the market. And so we haven't changed our messaging. I think that we continue to learn about GLP-1s. And if we need to adapt our messaging we will. But we haven't had to change our messaging and we continue to obviously have a lot of success. Can you remind me of the second part of your question there, Jayson? Unidentified Analyst : Type 2 -- it looked like Type 2 was strong just in terms of Type 2 adoption. Can I assume that it grew faster? If I just look at the number of type two added in 3Q this year versus last year it feels like, it's faster than overall Omnipod growth, if there's a way to bless that assumption that would be great. Jim Hollingshead : I'm not sure I would jump to that split. Go ahead. Go ahead, Lauren. Lauren Budden : I was just going to say it grew about the same. Operator : Our next question comes from Patrick Wood from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : I was going to make a joke about it. I think somebody else put the accent kind of gives me a way I am afraid. Thanks for taking my question. I'm just curious like big picture not about 2024 just slightly longer term how the launch in the U.K. and I mean, I guess, some of what's around Germany, how you're thinking the time line to returning to double-digit growth OUS [ph] could look. And is there anything you're seeing in those markets that would sort of prohibit you from reaccelerating as Omnipod 5 pushes through that region? Thanks. Jim Hollingshead : Thanks. Yeah, we're so excited about getting Omnipod 5 into multiple markets in Europe. As we said -- as we detailed in the prepared remarks the U.K. launch is going really well. Germany is strong out of the gate. In direct answer to your question we don't see any barriers to driving really strong and robust growth where we launch Omnipod 5. And as I think I said in the prepared remarks we're very confident it's going to be a leading offer wherever we're able to put it in the market. So it's such a great solution it's so easy for customers to use. It drives such great real-world results. And as we get more evidence and we can drive access conversations we're also confident we can get a price premium for the value that Omnipod 5 creates. And so we're all systems -- full speed ahead in getting into our international markets with Omnipod 5. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jeff Johnson : Thank you. Good afternoon guys. Nice quarter. Jim maybe if I could pin you down on a little bit more detail on the Sensor Integration side. So in LMR on G7 integration in the U.S. early in the year I know it's going to depend on what you see in the field what the feedback is and all that. But just generally do we tend to think of LMRs I could go back and check my notes I guess in O5. Is that like a three-month LMR and then a full launch or just how to think about that? And then on the L2 front obviously you gave some updates internationally. How should we think about the time line L2 in the U.S.? And L3 OUS and U.S. any updates there at all, just once L2 comes out integration is it a 6-month or is it a year? How far down the road might we see L3? Thanks. Jim Hollingshead : Yes. Thanks Jeff. I'll go in reverse order. We're not providing additional guidance on timing for the Libre family of sensors at this point. We do feel good about the integration we have going with our RADIANT trial. And the customer experience on the RADIANT -- which is the Libre 2 integration that we're doing in Europe. The customer experience on the RADIANT trial has been terrific. And so, we're very bullish on that. And obviously to be in trial with that system we have to have a working integration. So, we're bullish on that, but we're not ready to provide timing on Libre for any specific markets at this moment. On the LMR question, it's a great question. We don't -- we think of LMR as exercises to test hypotheses and make sure the system is working the way we want it to. So we don't actually put a time line on it. We put a set of conditions on it. And so, as we get into market with LMR, we'll see what we see. Obviously, we wouldn't be going into LMR with the G7 integration, if we weren't confident that the system was working as expected. But with all of these things, you have to get the product out in a while to see how it performs. And so we'll get the LMR out there and we'll move as quickly as we can and we're really excited about bringing that G7 integration to market. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Matt Taylor : Hey, thanks for taking the question. I guess I wanted to ask you more about your efforts in type 2. Obviously, you're having some good success there today with 20% coming into the fold and that being a consistent level over time a healthy level. But I guess my question is, as you get the hopefully additional indications that are able to market, do you expect the proportion of type 2s to increase in the future? Maybe offer some thoughts on where that could go to. And also, could that even further broaden the prescriber base once you have that? Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Matt. Those are both great questions. First thing I'll say is, we're so strong in type 1, all right? So our offering in type 1 is bringing so many customers into the market from MDI that we expect to continue to drive penetration to the type one market and bring those customers who are currently not on a technology-based solution onto Pod therapy. And so -- and therefore that portion of the growth will continue. We're very bullish on growing MDI in type 1. Type two is a massively underpenetrated market. And we've been through the numbers on this a couple of times. And it's in our deck that we put up our investor deck that shows the market size for type two -- the progression of type two disease. But we've got 30-some-odd million people diagnosed with type 2 in the US who then progress on the basal and then on to intensive insulin therapy. Right now, there are about 2.5 million people in the US market who need intensive insulin as a part of their type two diabetes care. And they're just really underpenetrated as a market for pump therapy overall and therefore for Pod therapy. And we're very, very bullish on that. So if you think about -- we'll continue to penetrate type 1. Type two is actually a larger end market for intensive insulin therapy than type 1. So the proportion -- I do think to your point, the proportion will probably swing as we're able to get the indication for use and drive adoption in the market, but the numbers will go up. The total adoption number of customers will go up on both fronts. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew O'Brien from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hey this is Phil on for Matt. Thanks for taking our questions and congrats on the quarter. Just wait Jim, as we think about the key growth factors for the business being on the volume side of things, the ratio of MDI to conversions has marched from 50-40 to now 80-20 in the US. Are you seeing any kind of slowdown in your ability to convert competitive pumpers? Also, if you could provide that same ratio in OUS given the launch there, what does that MDI-to-conversion ratio look like in Europe? Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Phil. The Q3 doesn't look hugely different from Q2 in terms of the mix of components of where customers are coming from. The only difference was -- and if I just back up, I'll go into the weeds for a second I apologize for going into the weeds. When we talk about sources of customers, whether it's type 1, type 2, MDI competitive conversion, we have different sources of data that allow us to estimate that including voluntary -- so when a customer enrolls on Omnipod, they will tell us where they're coming from usually. So it's voluntary information. It's not 100% data capture and what that means is there's a little bit of an estimation kind of range on those things. And so, Q3 compared to Q2 didn't look all that different. The only thing that looks different enough for us to change the number was competitive conversions went -- as you said, last quarter, we said it was 75-25. In this quarter, we said 80-20. But even that in terms of total number and range of estimate was not that huge a change. And we've been really happy with competitive conversions over the course of the launch of Omnipod 5. We're really clear at launch that the number, the volume of people converting from tubed pumps was a pleasant surprise for us. And we sustained that for a long time and probably a little longer on balance above historical trends of 80/20 sustained it for a little bit longer than we thought. So it's not really a surprise for us to get back to this 80/20 mix. And what it means is we continue to bring we're the clear market leader in bringing customers from MDI on to -- you could talk about again the broad category of AID but on to AID Pod therapy on Omnipod 5. We're the clear market leader in bringing MDI into the market and we're still taking share out of the installed base of tubed pumps. And so we don't really see anything in the data. And out in the market we see a lot of promotional activity. But we haven't -- our field is not really reporting any move that's making it harder for us in any way to convert people off of their tubed pump experience because Omnipod 5 and for that matter Omnipod DASH are so compelling. So that's maybe a long more in-the-weeds answer than you're looking for but that's how we see it. On the European side of the question, it's -- I think we're going to see that different market by market. And in fact in the UK what we see is different hospital by hospital. So in some instances, the NHS trust hospitals are tilting more towards new customer starts with Omnipod 5. And in some cases, they're tilting more towards upgrading from Omnipod DASH as a mix on balance more conversion than new customers start. A little bit of that is driven by physician preference and a little bit of that is driven by the hospital budget for the year. And so I think we'll see -- and I think it will look a little different in Germany and I think they'll look a little different as we get into other countries. As a reminder, the contracting in Europe locks everybody into a contract. So in the US we're in the pharmacy channel. It's easy to convert from a tubed pump on to Omnipod 5. In most of the European markets whether you're on an Omnipod DASH or you're on a tubed pump, you're locked into a contract for a period of time. And so for example in the UK it's at the discretion of the hospital to upgrade somebody to an Omnipod 5. And so that market behavior will look a little bit different market by market. What we do know is that Omnipod 5 is just -- the pent-up demand for Omnipod 5 in our European markets is really strong and you can see the results already in the UK. Operator : Our next question comes from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Margaret Kaczor : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to talk a little bit about Omnipod GO. I think you had mentioned that you're maybe seeing some pull-through in sales for the whole Omnipod family even early on. So is there any more detail around what you're seeing and how that relates maybe to the long-term commercial opportunity of a patient per account basis or however you look at it? And then as a follow-up, which I'll sneak through as you think about 2024 guidance, are you assuming any of that benefit from that pull-through direct sales from Omnipod 5? Thanks. Jim Hollingshead : Thanks Margaret. I'll do them in reverse order. We haven't put anything formally into the guide out of the Omnipod GO pilot and we're still planning -- so this is not even yet a limited market release. It's a commercial pilot. And so we haven't tried to quantify that or include any of it into the color that Lauren provided or the guide. The pilot the -- I'm really pleased that we're piloting it in the way we are because we are doing exactly what we wanted, which is we're learning a lot. And it's I would say a pleasant surprise as we get into these PCP practices and talk to them about the offering that not only do they recognize the target patient profile for Omnipod GO as we characterize it. But as we explain Omnipod GO and they see the ease of use of Omnipod GO they ask us about the broader product portfolio. And I don't think we anticipated that that would be happening. And so it's -- and what it tells us is that Omnipod therapy genuinely is so simple to use that it should open up the conversation in primary care. What we're using the pilot for is to figure out what are the mechanics of that. So what does it look like? How many reps? What's the call pattern? What's in the bag? And we're testing things like the target patient profiles and things like that. And so I continue to think of it as early days but the learnings from the pilot have been really, really productive for us as we think about how to approach type 2 patients in the primary channel. Operator : Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Good afternoon. This is actually Anthony [ph] on for Joanne. Thanks for taking our question. Just a quick easy one here. I just want to confirm the $10 million this quarter that was associated with the Omnipod 5 ramp dynamics. I just want to confirm that was the tailwind. And then are you providing any guidance on what this number could be next year whether it's a tailwind or a headwind? Thank you. Lauren Budden : Yes. So the $10 million is the double script phenomenon. And what's different now is that conversions is really a small component of that. So it's really immaterial. So going forward we expect the double script phenomenon to continue, but it's really just part of our normal growth rate going forward on new customer starts. Operator : Our next question comes from William Plovanic from Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Caitlin Cronin : Hi. This is Caitlin Cronin on for Bill and congrats on a great quarter. Just to dig into US competition a little bit more it seems like there's been a few new entrants into the market this year and updates and potentially some early next year. How are you thinking about kind of the competitive landscape for tubed pumps and then also kind of for patch pumps in development going forward? Thank you. Jim Hollingshead : Hi, Caitlin. We're very confident in our competitive position. Omnipod 5 with G6 sensor is the best AID offering on the market. And what we see coming in competitor pipelines -- we think nothing in competitive pipeline is as good as Omnipod 5 with G6. And so -- and it doesn't mean that there won't be competition. As I said earlier, we see our competitors out there's a lot of promotional activity around from some of our competitors. So we see that out in the world. We haven't really seen it impact our results at this point. Now competition always -- I think -- first of all, I think, competition is great for business. It helps everybody learn and develop better products and it helps customers have better experience, which is what we're all trying to do. And so we know there's going to be competition. We know our competitors continue to try to innovate, but we're very, very confident in our competitive position and our growth profile. And that's why we're so excited about the growth catalysts we have coming in 2024. As to patch pump companies there's patch pumps -- we're the leader in patch pump. There's not really a viable patch pump competitor that we see on the horizon. And so that's another reason that we're very, very bullish on our position and expect to continue to lead the market. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Kratky from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Mike Kratky : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking our question. So regarding the ongoing SECURE pivotal trial for Omnipod 5. How are you thinking about how that could impact the commercial opportunity for this product over the next few years? And what are the other main drivers that you expect to increase penetration within the insulin-intensive Type 2 patients that remain so underpenetrated? Jim Hollingshead : Thanks for the question. We're very excited about the SECURE trial. And as I said in our prepared comments, we've completed the goal for recruitment. And so just to be clear what that means that trial is designed to be up to 400 patients, but it has a minimum number of patients that are required. And so we crossed over the hurdle for the minimum number of patients. And the way to think about that is that it derisks the trial from an enrollment point of view. So we now are certain to have enough patients to successfully complete the trial. Enrollment is still open. So we'll continue to enroll some patients for the next little while because it's always better to have more patients in the trial rather than fewer. But -- so the trial is derisked operationally now with enough patients in to get a powered results that we need. And we'll continue the trial. And then it's a 13-week protocol. Once the last patient is in they'll complete the 13-week protocol. We'll gather the data, we'll clean the data, we'll prepare submission and so on. And then it will be in the hands of the FDA. And that will be a huge unlock for us in the Type 2 space. We're already the market leader in Type 2 with Omnipod DASH. Omnipod DASH has had an indication for use in Type 2 for some time. And we've been promoting Omnipod DASH for Type 2 this year. And you can see the results already. So if you saw quarter-over-quarter DASH actually did really well in the quarter, a little bit better than last quarter in terms of percent of revenue. And that's clearly because as we're out talking to physicians about Type 2 patients and Pod therapy we're driving growth in Type 2. We also know -- even though we cannot promote Omnipod 5 because it does not yet have an indication for use we do know that AID for people with Type 2 and specifically Omnipod 5 AID for people with Type 2 has very high appeal and physicians are writing it off label even though we're not promoting it. And so when you take those two things together the success of Omnipod DASH in the Type 2 market, the obvious pent-up demand for Omnipod 5 in the type two market once we get the indication for use with a successful result from the SECURE trial we think it will unlock massive growth for us. That will come in the endocrinology channel. That's what we also think type 2 growth can come out of the PCP channel which is why we are piloting Omnipod GO in the PCP channel because it extends our reach upstream for type 2 patients, as they initiate insulin therapy with a basal offering. And then as they progress, they will already be on an Omnipod offering and they should pretty seamlessly progress onto either Omnipod DASH or Omnipod 5. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Lichtman from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Steven Lichtman : Thank you. So you mentioned earlier you're clearly moving your prescriber base past high-volume endos. Do you need to expand sort of your feet on the street meaningfully as this prescriber base continues to grow? Or are you seeing leverage opportunities from your current team? Jim Hollingshead : Great question, Steve. And I would say two things on that front. The first one is, we are considering expanding feet on the street and that's part of the Omnipod GO commercial pilot to figure out how many feet on the street we need to get the reach that we want. The other thing is we get a lot of leverage out of DTP. And so a lot of the physicians that are writing for us, don't necessarily have a rep calling on them right now. And what's happening is our DTP advertising often reaches physicians by the way. So they often see the product through our online media or maybe on the TV ad, but patients go in and ask for Omnipod into those practices that we don't necessarily have a call routine with. So we're getting leverage in that way already. And then we will consider adding feet on the street as you say as appropriate over the coming quarters. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Pasquale from Nephron. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Chris Pasquale : Thanks. I just want to follow-up on the O5 type 2 opportunity. How are you thinking about the time line for FDA approval? And then also for presentation of that data - because it sounds like there's also already a fair amount of off-label interest. And it would seem like perhaps the data presentation itself could be a catalyst to spur even more interest before you actually get the labeling? Jim Hollingshead : Great questions, Chris. First on timing, we haven't announced a formal time line on getting to an FDA clearance out of SECURE trial, but it's fairly easy to do the math. I think the last patient will probably be in no later than the end of the calendar year a 13-week protocol analyze the data to do a filing. So I think it's safe to say that, we'll be filing with the FDA in 2024 for sure for clearance. And then we'll see what happens in terms of -- each of those steps can have a plus or minus on the time line on them. But we expect to file next year for that. In between now and then there's a couple of things that are in terms of data on the study. We have published data out of our type 2 feasibility trial. And as we've referred to that in the context of the GLP-1 news that what we do see in -- out of our feasibility data is that the patients in that smallest trial who were also on GLP-1s actually did better on Omnipod 5 than patients not on GLP-1s and for reasons that we explained in the slides that we posted last quarter and that we've updated this week. And so GLP-1s make the body more sensitive to insulin and they reduced the required dose. And so the combination of the 2 actually ends up with a better outcome for patients which is interesting. And along those lines we anticipate that we will have a large number just about half plus or minus of the current enrollees in that trial are already on either an SGLT2 or a GLP-1. And so we anticipate being able to report out on subsets of the trial. That may happen -- it may happen before the FDA filing it may happen after but we anticipate being able to do some kind of scientific reporting on that as well during 2024. Operator : Our next question comes from Marie Thibault from BTIG. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Marie Thibault : Thanks for squeezing me in. Congrats on the iOS clearance. Just a quick one here on that. When might we see the G7 Omnipod five integrated with iOS as well just all the latest generation? Thanks. Jim Hollingshead : We haven't guided the timing on that Marie. You can imagine that that's a very urgent matter for us to get to. But we'll do first things first. And so we'll get an LMR with iOS which will be a G6 offering initially. And we'll get into LMR G7 and then the two systems will come together after that. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Jennings from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open Q \u2013 Josh Jennings : HI, good afternoon. Congratulations on another strong quarter. Wanted to follow up on Steve's question on the expanding prescriber base. Any chance, you can help us think through the penetration into the 7,000 to 8,000 US endocrinologists? And then of the additional prescribers, I guess if you're almost fully penetrated there 7,000 to 9,000? Are those -- some of those nurse, practitioners and endocrinology practices? Are they PCPs? Maybe just help us better understand where you're getting this prescriber expansion outside of endocrinology. Thanks a lot. Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Josh. I'll provide -- we don't have perfect data on the specifics of your question, but we're very well penetrated with endocrinologists. We know that some of those prescribers are nurse practitioners and other care extenders, in endo practices. And then we know that some of the writers are PCPs or PAs attached to nonspecialist practices as well. But, I don't think -- I mean I'll turn to Lauren and/or Deb, to see if we have other color than that. That's the color I think we have. Deborah Gordon : No. This is Deb. That's the color that we have, Jim. It's great because, what we are seeing is we're seeing increases from all aspects. We're seeing increasing prescribers from endos, increasing prescribers from HCPs. And it's great that we also have PCPs, that are becoming aware of the system and prescribing it. So, we look at the trend data and we see it increasing over the last quarter and it's been great. So, we'll see where it goes from there. Operator : Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open Q \u2013 Danielle Antalffy : Hi, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on a really strong quarter. I guess my one question is a question I ask a lot, and that's around the primary care physician population here and just sort of what is was doing to ensure that they're appropriately servicing that prescribing base, because they do own the majority of the Type 2 so really executing upon that once you do get to Omnipod 5, Type 2, indication. And is it going to require you to add to the sales force? Or do you think you have enough to get to all the high-prescribing physicians? Thanks so much. Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Danielle. Primary care physicians are really important in the Type 2 patient journey absolutely. And a couple of things, that we're doing there. One is, that's a main -- that's one of the main objectives of our Omnipod GO commercial pilot. We really want to understand better than we do right now, kind of in person what's going on in the primary care channel. And so the Omnipod GO commercial pilot has allowed us to get into a number of primary practices, present a target patient population of them, which we're finding is ringing true for them for the GO offering. And as I said earlier, it's really allowing us to see that -- primary practices, don't know much often about our portfolio products. And once we get in there they're very interested in our full portfolio including Omnipod DASH. And of course, we're not indicated for Omnipod 5, so we're not promoting it there. But it's giving us an opportunity to talk about the whole portfolio. And out of the pilot, we'll develop a better approach or find approach for how to commercialize into primary care. And there are several other options. The other thing, that that we see is that our DTP advertising or sorry direct-to-patient direct-to-consumer-type advertising, and our social media does tend to reach into the primary channel. So physicians, often see that media and patients often see the medium walk into their position and ask about it. So, we're getting leverage in that way as well. And I agree with you we need to really service type 2 patients. We need to find them where they are and very often where they are as in the primary channel. Operator : Our last question today will come from Matt Miksic from Barclays. Please go ahead, your line is open. Matt Miksic : Great. Thanks so much for fitting me in. So, maybe just if you could with sort of the thinking of entering the basal market potentially on the other side of this, just give us a sense of your expectations there in terms of is this sort of attaching with relationships with patients potentially as they move into a more insulin-intensive clinical needs. Or is this a portion of that market that you feel -- I'm speaking beyond the sort of out-of-pocket interest that you've seen so far. But -- is there a portion of that market that you think is particularly attractive and maybe the size around that? Just sort of an update on your view as to what is that opportunity in addition of course being very large compared to the insulin-intensive opportunity? Thanks. Jim Hollingshead : Yes. Thanks Matt. There are at least 3 million patients in the US who are on basal-only therapy. Some people say 4 million, so let's call it 3 million to 4 million people on basal-only insulin therapy who have type 2 diabetes in the US. Really only a small penetration in that market helps meaningful with our growth trajectory because our aim is to not only serve those patients but to introduce the Omnipod family of products to them such that when their disease progresses, which is essentially inevitable, as their disease progresses, we have a relationship with them. We're helping with the therapy early and then we stay -- they stay with us, we stay with them as their disease progresses. The target patient population there is -- there's a lot of people there and there's a lot of offerings in there. There's people on MDI. We've been asked before and we're conscious of the fact that the insulin companies are looking to launch once-a-week insulin, which will be a type of therapy in that market. We think there's a lot of room in that market for different offerings. And for us there's some clear benefits that we bring to market with Omnipod GO, which include there's no needles. So, there's a very significant percentage of patients don't want to do an injectable therapy because they don't like needles. And then the other thing is people forget to take their care. They forget to take their insulin. And so we think that we solve both of these problems for both patients and their physicians and that's what we're testing out in our commercial pilot. So, we think there is a meaningful market there for us for Omnipod GO with basal-only therapy. And importantly, we think when we get to those patients and help them early in their patient journey, we can help them throughout their patient journey. And eventually many of them will end up on Omnipod DASH or Omnipod 5. And so that's the theory of the case. It's both end. It's a meaningful market for us is a basal market. And it's early customer acquisition if you think about it that way early in the patient lifecycle, which helps us to acquire those patients much further upstream. Operator : I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back to Jim Hollingshead for closing remarks. Jim Hollingshead : Thank you everybody for joining us today. We're really excited to have delivered another outstanding quarter for Insulet with our Omnipod family of products, clearly driving growth and have great momentum in the type 1 market, both in the US and now excited internationally, as we've launched Omnipod 5 in the UK and Germany and are on track to deliver in other international markets. Clearly, leading the market in type 2, which is a very exciting development for us. I want to thank all of our Insulet employees for their dedication and for their focus on mission because it's helped us to get out and continue to reach all the people out there that we've reached helping them simplify their lives with diabetes. There are millions of people around the world that we intend to help and we're well on track to do that. Thanks everybody for joining us today and have a good evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations. Deborah Gordon : Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Insulet's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Call. With me today are Jim Hollingshead President and Chief Executive Officer; and Lauren Budden, our Interim Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Both the replay of this call and the press release discussing our 2023 results, and 2024 guidance will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. . Also on our website is our fourth quarter supplemental earnings presentation. We encourage you to reference that document for a summary of key metrics and business updates. Before we begin, we remind you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such statements. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely adjusted growth and operating margin, adjusted EBITDA and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. These measures align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance, and we believe they are helpful to investors, analysts and other interested parties as measures of our operating performance from period to period. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis with the exception of revenue growth rate, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim. Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With our strong Q4 2023 results, we kept off another transformational year, in which we firmly established Insulet as the market leader in automated insulin delivery. In 2023, we realized a 30% revenue growth, which marked our eighth consecutive year of 20-plus percent revenue growth and represented dollar growth of almost $400 million. We accomplished this while also significantly expanding margins and generating positive free cash flow. Our record new customer starts in 2023, fueled our global growth and our Omnipod 5 AID system, which generated $1 billion in revenue in 2023 is transforming diabetes management. We entered 2024 with significant momentum, and we are looking forward to a year of many growth catalysts ahead. On today's call, I want to do three things : first, discuss our financial results and market traction. Next, I'll provide an update on the continuing progress of our clinical efforts and then review key developments in our innovation pipeline. Our fourth quarter revenue once again exceeded our expectations with total Omnipod growth of 35%, including U.S. growth of 43%. Part of our outperformance was driven by U.S. distributors placing additional orders near the end of the quarter, which we had not factored into our guidance. We'll provide more detail on this in a few minutes. Yet even without these additional orders, we closed out 2023 ahead of our expectations, including healthy margin expansion. These are remarkable results, and I want to thank our global team for their execution and dedication. We are proud of the incredible impact the Omnipod product platform is having on people with diabetes. We recently achieved milestones of roughly 425,000 active global customers on the Omnipod platform, which represents growth of approximately 25% from this time last year. This also includes almost 250,000 customers on Omnipod 5, which has proven to be revolutionary. And Omnipod DASH continues to drive strong new customer starts in our U.S. type 2 diabetes market as well as in most of our international markets. We are thrilled that our unique technology is making a meaningful impact on the diabetes community, advancing our mission to improve the lives of people with diabetes around the world. Omnipod 5 is the only FDA cleared, fully disposable pod-based AID system. This makes our product unique and clearly differentiated from competitors' offers. These product attributes underpin our competitive advantages and are key to fueling our growth, further establishing our leadership position and expertise in the diabetes market. The fully on-body wearable AID experience of Omnipod 5 dramatically reduces the daily burden of living with diabetes. And its simplicity, ease of use and broad and affordable access are also key drivers of its rapid adoption. For almost a decade, we have significantly invested in U.S. pharmacy channel access, including building the infrastructure, developing key pharmacy relationships, creating an easy onboarding pathway and building deep in-house expertise, all of which has resulted in a strong and leading channel access we have today. We continue to strengthen Omnipod's access and affordability, including our innovation pipeline that will go through this channel by building on our advantages. In the U.S., Omnipod 5 continue to represent the vast majority of our new customer starts in Q4, and we expect this trend to continue. In addition, customer retention remains strong. The mix of U.S. new customer starts coming from multiple daily injections and legacy tubed pumps continued at an estimated 80-20 percentage split. Today, even with improved technology, most people using insulin still use MDI as their mode of care. More than 60% of people with type 1 diabetes in the U.S. are on MDI and the vast majority of people with type 2 diabetes are using daily injections. Therefore, bringing people out of MDI and on to Omnipod remains the largest opportunity for us, and we continue to drive pump penetration and share gain in both the type 1 and type 2 markets, strengthening our leadership position. Omnipod 5 not only drove our number one position for U.S. and customer starts in 2023, it was the most prescribed AID system in the U.S. This is because a growing number of health care providers are writing scripts for it. In Q4, we saw another increase in prescribers growing to over 18,500, up from 17,000 in Q3. We speak with many HCPs and it is clear that Omnipod 5 is the winning choice for AIB. It is extremely gratifying to see the growing demand, confidence and adoption which have led to a growing number of scripts HCPs now write for our system. Our strong new customer starts included continuing adoption of Omnipod in the U.S., type 2 diabetes market. We estimate that no more than 5% of people with type 2 diabetes who need intensive insulin therapy are currently using any kind of pump. And we know that we are already the market leader in that space. We are confident that Omnipod will prove to be a simple and compelling solution for the millions of people globally with type 2 diabetes who today need insulin therapy as a part of their diabetes care regimen as well as the future millions who will naturally progress to requiring insulin as a part of their care. We are well positioned to bring all of the benefits of the Omnipod platform with people with type 2 diabetes both today and in the future. In the fourth quarter, type 2 diabetes patients represented between 20% and 25% of our U.S. new customer starts across our Omnipod suite of products. While Omnipod DASH, with its type 2 indication for use is the leading insulin pump operating in this market, we look forward to marketing Omnipod 5 to type 2 patients once we have an expanded indication. The underlying demand is apparent. We expect the last participant to complete our type 2 pivotal trial in the coming weeks, and we plan to submit results to the FDA by the end of 2024 for an expanded indication. We are confident this will be another catalyst that will fuel our growth trajectory, allow us to serve more patients and help us deliver on our mission. We look forward to sharing study results at ADA this June. The success of Omnipod 5, including its early yet powerful impact in 2 of our European markets, led to another strong quarter of new customer starts globally. Internationally, we realized a notable sequential increase in new customer starts, driven by the impact of Omnipod 5 that's having in the U.K. and Germany. Our early success in these countries supports our confidence that it will continue to transform diabetes care and position us as a market leader everywhere Omnipod 5 is available. We remain on track with our Omnipod 5 plus G6 European launch plans with the aim of making Omnipod 5 accessible to the majority of our European customers by the end of 2024. We are also thrilled to begin our journey launching Omnipod 5 integrated with Abbott\u2019s Freestyle Libre 2 Plus sensor. I'll speak to this new opportunity in a moment. In addition to our type 2 pivotal study progress, we are meaningfully advancing several other clinical initiatives. We are excited to attend the ATTD International Conference in Italy in a couple of weeks where we will present data for the Omnipod 5 plus G6 randomized controlled trial. This RCT compared Omnipod 5 to non-AID pump and included study sites in the U.S. and France. We are thrilled to have recently published in the Diabetes Technology and Therapeutics Journal real-world evidence from almost 70,000 people with type 1 diabetes, demonstrating Omnipod 5's effectiveness in a large, diverse population. The data are impressive and demonstrate the strength of the Omnipod 5 algorithm in the real world delivering leading time in range and very low hypoglycemia, reinforcing Omnipod 5 as the obvious choice for clinical outcomes and personalized diabetes care. Central to everything we do is our mission to simplify life for people with diabetes. We want to make it easier for people to get prescribed therapy, get set up on therapy and use therapy consistently over time. This is the point of our evolution feasibility study taking place in New Zealand. Our intent is to have a next-generation algorithm that will further drive simplicity of use. We completed the first feasibility study in participants with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes, commencing initially in supervised hotel setting and then progressing to at-home use. We are pleased with the preliminary results and are analyzing the data and making modifications for the next round of subjects. We will present early feasibility results at ATTD. Lastly, we continue to actively enroll participants in our RADIANT study in France, the U.K. and Belgium, which is our Libre 2 integration trial. We began enrollment in September 2023, which is now halfway complete. Feedback has been tremendous and physicians new to Omnipod 5 appreciate its simplicity and potential to reach many more pump-naive users. As a reminder, both our G6 and Libre 2 studies are designed to provide the evidence we need to elevate Omnipod 5 status as superior first-line therapy and help drive our pricing and market access initiatives as we further roll out Omnipod 5 with multiple sensors across our international markets. I'll now provide an update on our innovation progress and we'll focus on three key areas : expanding the Omnipod 5 platform, moving upstream in the type 2 market with Omnipod Go and building our digital and data capabilities. Many of you have heard us say that our current Omnipod 5 system is our \"minimum\" viable product. That's easy to forget given how quickly the market has adopted Omnipod 5 and made it the leading offer. Our current version is on only one operating system, Android. It is integrated with only one continuous glucose monitoring partner, Dexcom and until recently, was commercialized with only G6, and it contains our first-generation algorithm. This is about to change with platform extensions that will strengthen our leadership, deepen our competitive moats and allow us to open up Omnipod 5 to many more customers. To start, we are excited to have commenced our U.S. limited market release of Omnipod 5 with G7 over the last 2 weeks. This initial release will allow us time to test the market and build product at scale to prepare for what we are confident will be a very successful full market release of G7 this year. We anticipate an acceleration in new customer starts following a full launch, which will help to fuel our revenue growth more meaningfully in 2025 and beyond. We are also on track with our planned limited market release of Omnipod 5 with Libre 2 Plus in the first half of this year in the Netherlands and U.K. made possible by the CE Mark approval we received earlier this month. We are excited that the option for customers to use Omnipod 5 with both G6 and Libre 2 Plus will enable us to reach many more patients. Our recent and upcoming CGM integrations are important milestones in providing choice to tens of thousands of customers who want to use Omnipod 5 and we believe both integrations will be a significant catalyst for our growth in 2024 and beyond. Rounding out near-term innovation, we are planning for our U.S. launch of Omnipod 5 with the G6 system with our iOS app this year. This will mark a major innovation milestone because so many of our U.S. customers use Apple iPhone and prefer to carry only one phone. Another innovation that will allow us to reach more people and further expand our total addressable market is Omnipod GO, a solution designed for individuals with type 2 who naturally progress to requiring basal-only insulin and want a simple way to receive their daily dose, while avoiding the burden of injections. Our commercial pilot is underway, and it will help us refine our commercialization plans. Omnipod DASH has already made Insulet the leader in insulin delivery for people with type 2 diabetes. And with Omnipon GO, we are well positioned to move upstream in the patient care pathway. When we achieve clearance for Omnipod 5 in the type 2 market, we will bring all of the advantages of our AID system to this market. With these 3 products, our aim is to deliver an Omnipod portfolio that meets the full range of needs of people with type 2 who require insulin as a part of their care. We are excited about our innovation in the space and our ability to address the unmet needs that exist in this patient population. It is a massive global market that we expect will continue to grow, and we have the clear lead to pursue this market opportunity. We are also excited to build on our digital and data capabilities. One of the breakthrough features of Omnipod 5 is the real-time data provided by SIM cards in every controller. We constantly hear from physicians and patients how much they appreciate not needing to plug in for real-time usage data and 100% cloud connectivity has already given us the opportunity to publish the largest, real-world data set on AID. Over time, we plan to use the data to speed our product development, further improve the user experience, streamline physician workflows and build on our competitive advantages. We also continue building digital and data-driven products to simplify diabetes management for both customers and caregivers. In closing, Insulet continues to set the standard for the industry. With a strong 2023 behind us, we see multiple catalysts in the coming year and beyond. We are confident we will drive significant growth and continued success. I want to thank our Insulet global team for your dedication and deep passion for our customers and your commitment to delivering innovation. You are the reason for our success and our ability to continue to drive our mission to simplify life for the millions of people with diabetes around the world. With that, I will turn the call over to Lauren. Lauren Budden : Thanks, Jim. 2023 was another exciting year for Insulet, and the fourth quarter was no exception. We have strong momentum with many catalysts that will drive revenue growth and margin expansion in 2024 and over the long term. In Q4, we generated strong global, new customer starts fueled by the continued high demand for Omnipod 5, not only in the U.S. but also in our first 2 European markets. . As a result of our growing customer base, we delivered 37% revenue growth in Q4, driven by global Omnipod growth of over 35%. We benefited from a shift in order timing and an increase in days on hand at certain pharmacy distributors, which I'll speak to in a moment. Without these benefits, our results still exceeded these guidance ranges. On a reported basis, for total revenue, foreign currency was a 130 basis point tailwind compared to Q4 of last year. U.S. Omnipod revenue growth was 43%, which continues to be driven by our annuity-based model and growing U.S. pharmacy volume. This includes an increasing volume contribution from Omnipod 5 and the related premium for pods in the U.S. pharmacy. Pharmacy channel access continues to be a benefit for the many reasons Jim spoke to, and our efforts to drive increased volume through this channel have resulted in almost all of our U.S. volume going through the pharmacy channel. The recurring net volume benefit we recognized in Q4 from new customers who received their starter kits and first refill orders was in line with our expectations and remain consistent with Q3 levels. We expect this trend to continue. Also as expected, the same net volume benefit from existing customers converting to Omnipod 5 was immaterial since the vast majority had already previously converted. In Q4, U.S. revenue benefited from 2 dynamics not previously contemplated in our guidance. First, our largest U.S. pharmacy wholesalers collectively placed an estimated $20 million to $25 million in orders that were accelerated from the first quarter of 2024 in advance of our implementation of a new ERP system at the start of 2024. The second benefit was an increase in estimated channel inventory days on hand of approximately $10 million to $15 million as pharmacy distributors returned to their normal levels. As a reminder, in the first half of 2023, we called out a reduction in inventory days on hand below normal levels. What this boils down to is approximately $30 million to $40 million in revenue in Q4 that we had not anticipated, contributing approximately 12 points to our U.S. revenue growth. We are proud of our fourth quarter U.S. performance, especially given the tougher comparison due to the Omnipod 5 full market release in August of 2022. Additionally, new customer starts in Q4 were slightly down from Q3 as expected as the market is moving from Dexcom's G6 sensor to G7. We are excited to have launched our U.S. limited market release of Omnipod 5 with G7. And as Jim shared, we expect new customer starts to accelerate throughout 2024 as we ramp our commercial efforts. Overall, our U.S. business and related revenue growth are very strong, fueled by Omnipod 5's success and continued robust demand. International Omnipod revenue increased 12.5%, which was above our expectations. Growth was primarily driven by continued strong adoption of Omnipod DASH and to a smaller degree, a benefit from our Omnipod 5 launches in the U.K. and Germany, both of which drove notable increases in new customer starts. On a reported basis, foreign currency was a 550 basis point tailwind over the prior year, which was approximately 250 points favorable versus our guide. In Q4, our estimated global attrition and utilization trends remained stable. Drug Delivery revenue was almost $9 million, representing a $5.5 million increase, which was above our guidance range due to timing. Gross margin was 70.9%, up over 1,200 basis points. Excluding the impact of the 2022 medical device corrections, adjusted gross margin increased 620 basis points to 70.7% in Q4 2023. This exceeded our expectations due to favorable manufacturing costs and product mix. The increase in adjusted gross margin was primarily driven by improved manufacturing efficiencies and favorable mix that included a premium from volume growth in the pharmacy channel. Partially offsetting the favorable contributors were expected higher production costs as U.S. manufacturing continues to ramp and become a larger portion of our total production. Operating expenses increased in line with our expectations as we invested in our business to support our strong growth trajectory, including gearing up for near-term product launches globally. Adjusted operating margin was 20.7% and adjusted EBITDA was 26.9% of revenue. Both were above our expectations, primarily due to the $30 million to $40 million revenue benefit I mentioned, which had an estimated 360 basis point favorable impact on adjusted operating margin. To a lesser extent, both outperformed due to our higher-than-expected gross margin. Turning to cash and liquidity. We ended the year with over $700 million in cash and the full $300 million available under our credit facility. At the end of January, we successfully repriced our Term Loan B at a lower interest rate, which will reduce interest expense on an annualized basis by almost $2 million. We also achieved the milestone during the year of turning free cash flow positive, generating approximately $70 million in 2023. We continue to strengthen our financial position, giving us the flexibility to invest throughout our organization to drive long-term sustainable growth while at the same time expanding our margins and generating positive free cash flow. Now turning to our 2024 outlook. We continue to expect another year of large dollar growth even with the significant volume benefits realized in 2023, most notably from our Omnipod 5 ramp. We expect to approach total company revenue of $2 billion at the high end of our guidance range. For the full year, we expect total Omnipod revenue growth of 13% to 18% and total company revenue growth of 12% to 17%. As a reminder, our total company growth expectations exclude approximately 3 points due to the estimated $20 million to $25 million in orders that were accelerated to the fourth quarter of 2023. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect revenue growth of 16% to 21% driven by strong Omnipod 5 adoption as well as recurring revenue from Omnipod DASH and the benefits of our annuity model and pharmacy channel access. As a reminder, we have a tougher comparison in 2024, resulting from the significant 2 scripts and retail channel net stocking volume benefits in 2023. In addition, our expectations exclude approximately 4 points of growth due to the estimated orders that shifted into 2023. When factoring this into both periods, our normalized expectation for 2024 at the high end of our range is in line with the color we provided on our third quarter call of mid-20% growth. We anticipate new customer starts in the first half of 2024 to be slightly lower than the levels we had in the second half of 2023 due to normal seasonality trends, and we expect an acceleration in the second half of 2024 following a full market release of Omnipod 5 with G7. Also, as a reminder, estimated revenue from Omnipod 5 with our iOS app and from Omnipod GO is expected to be immaterial. We also currently expect the cadence of our revenue growth to be weighted more towards the second half of 2024 due to the timing of new customer starts, partially offset by the Q4 2023 stocking benefit. For international Omnipod, we expect revenue growth of 7% to 10%, which is in line with the 2024 color we previously provided of high single digits. On a reported basis, we are assuming no foreign currency impact. We expect growth to be driven by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption and from our recent Omnipod 5 launches in the U.K. and Germany. We expect continued headwinds in the countries where we do not yet have Omnipod 5 to partially offset this growth. We are excited to enter our first European markets in the first half of 2024, with Omnipod 5 integrated with Abbott's FreeStyle Libre 2 Plus and to launch Omnipod 5 with G6 in another market around the same time. As a reminder, given the nature of our annuity model, we expect these launches to more meaningfully contribute to our growth rate in 2025. We continue to expect the first half of the year to be in the high single digits range and to accelerate in the second half of the year to a range of high single digits to low double digits, primarily due to a more meaningful contribution from our Omnipod 5 U.K. and Germany launches and, to a lesser extent, the additional launches in 2024. Lastly, for Drug Delivery, we expect a 50% to 60% decline in line with the 2024 color we previously provided. Turning to 2024 gross margin. We expect a range of 68% to 69% and anticipated benefit from favorable product mix and manufacturing efficiencies. Partially offsetting these tailwinds are higher costs associated with our new product launches. We expect gross margin in the second half of the year to be higher than the first half due to accelerating revenue throughout the year and continued manufacturing efficiencies. In 2024, we plan to expand both gross and operating margins while driving market growth. We expect operating expenses to increase as we invest in R&D and clinical and expand our sales force and other functions to support our commercial efforts and growth initiatives, including our near-term product lines. Our sales force expansion includes hiring some reps specifically focused on pediatrics, a population for which Omnipod has always captured a large share. Even with increased investments, we have many opportunities to significantly expand margins and increase shareholder value, and we remain committed to doing just that. We expect operating margin to be approximately 13%, up approximately 100 basis points from 2023 adjusted operating margin. When factoring in the 130 basis point year-over-year unfavorable impact in 2024 from the $20 million to $25 million shift in order timing, we expect operating margins to be approximately 200 basis points higher in 2024 over 2023. We expect operating margin to significantly improve in the second half of the year over the first half due to revenue ramping during the year and continued manufacturing improvements. We have many catalysts for growth in 2024 and considerable opportunities to drive further margin expansion over the near and long term coming from scaling the business efficiently even with the continued focused investments in our robust innovation pipeline and commercial efforts. We expect capital expenditures to almost double from 2023 due to the timing of spend to support our planned 2024 production at our new Malaysia manufacturing facility as well as investments to support continuous improvement efforts in our other manufacturing locations and to a lesser degree, investment in IT infrastructure. Turning to our first quarter 2024 guidance. We expect total Omnipod growth of 15% to 18% and total company growth of 17% to 20%. Our total company revenue expectations exclude approximately 6 points of growth due to the orders that shifted into 2023. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect growth of 19% to 22%, which excludes over 8 points of growth due to the orders that shifted into 2023. For international Omnipod, we expect growth of 5% to 8%. On a reported basis, we estimate a favorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 100 basis points. Finally, we expect Q1 drug delivery revenue to be approximately $5 million to $6 million. In conclusion, we delivered another quarter and year of significant financial performance and strategic execution. We have strong momentum at the start of 2024 with many catalysts ahead and as a result, we are in a fantastic position to continue to grow and efficiently scale our business. The global market opportunities for Insulet are tremendous, and we will continue to invest in innovation with an increased commitment to significant margin expansion. We are well positioned to drive long-term value creation for our shareholders and to deliver on our mission for our customers. With that, operator, please open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Travis Steed with Bank of America. Travis Steed : I wanted to ask about the guidance on U.S. growth. If you just do the math using year-over-year growth rates, you get 2% from stocking which implies like 18% to 23% versus kind of the mid-20s guide before. But I know you said in the script like there was really no change to guidance. And I guess if you just do it on dollars, you kind of get to the same place. Maybe you can just provide some clarification on the U.S. guide and how it's changed versus 3 months ago. Lauren Budden : So yes, just in November when we gave guidance, it really hasn't changed much in our view. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we had a $30 million to $40 million shift in revenue -- or sorry, incremental revenue. Of that $10 million to $15 million was an increase in days on hand inventory levels. And so that, we have seen the inventory levels brought down earlier in the first half of the year. So that was a piece of that. The rest of it, the $20 million to $25 million was the shift that we saw in order timing from Q1 to Q4. So for that, that was in advance of our ERP. And if you were to normalize for that, which contributed about 12 points benefit to our U.S. revenue growth rate, we really achieved the high end of our guidance range there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Rohin Patel : This is actually Rohin on for Robbie. You came off a really great year on both the top and bottom lines with continued health and new patient growth in the U.S. as well. I was wondering, if you could elaborate more on some of the key growth drivers to new patient growth as well as margin expansion in 2024 and beyond. Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Rohin. I'll take the first shot at that, but then I'm sure Lauren may want to comment as well. I mean I think that the main -- there's just a core driver to new customer starts for us, which is Omnipod 5 is clearly the most preferred product in the market. We lead in new customer starts. Wherever we take Omnipod 5, we lead in new customer starts for people coming up with MDI, and we continue to take a lot of competitor share. So the Omnipod 5 offering as it exists today is already an underlying growth driver for us. Then there are a number of things that we'll bring to market in 2024 that will drive a lot of growth. We'll be able to drive international expansion for Omnipod 5 in 2024 as we said. We're aiming to get into the G6 product to market into the Netherlands along with sensor of choice in U.K., Netherlands in the first half. And as we've said, by the end of 2024, we expect to have Omnipod 5 available to the majority of our customers in our European markets. And then obviously, G7. So we're really excited to have been able to accelerate our G7 LMR by a couple of weeks, a little bit earlier than our expectation. We've been in market now with the LMR for not quite 3 weeks, about 2.5 weeks and aim to bring a full market release of G7 during the year, which we think will continue to drive new customer starts for us. So we're very, very excited about that. So there's a lot of catalysts coming in our innovation pipeline that will drive growth on top of the already existing leading market position for Omnipod 5. But I'm sure, Lauren, will want to pick up on -- at least I'm guessing, Lauren, you want to pick up on some of which you asked her as well. Lauren Budden : So yes, we have a lot of additional opportunities for improvement, especially if we exceed our revenue targets and you saw that in Q4, we had tremendous operating margin. It was over 20% on an adjusted basis. And if you normalize for the revenue shift, it was about 17%. So if we can exceed revenue, we can have a lot of incremental margin opportunity. But keep in mind that we will be balancing that with investment. So as Jim mentioned, we have a lot of new product launches coming up, and we want to make sure we're executing on our strategic imperatives to drive future growth in 2025 and beyond. So we will be balancing that with the revenue drop through to the bottom line. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Baird. Jeff Johnson : Jim, you're encouraging to hear that O5 in the majority of the EU markets by the end of 2024. That's the good thing. I didn't hear anything on G7 integration with O5 in Europe. In 2024. I know you are specifically not providing that, but any color you can provide there, especially in the context of talking about your U.S. growth accelerating in 2024, just as the market is starting to move to G7 and you need to get that FMR on G7 out there in the U.S. to then take advantage of that move to G7 that Dexcom has seen. So I guess, it sounds like that lack of G7 integration could be a headwind in '24 offset by the O5 expanding in EU. So just how do we think about those 2 disparate factors, if you will? Jim Hollingshead : Yes. Thanks, Jeff, and nice to hear from you. So one way to think about this is that we're prioritizing the sequencing, right? And so we know that driving the integration with sensors and driving sensor of choice as we call it for customers is really, really important. And you can see -- in a way, you can see what we're doing here because we're already into LMR with G7 in the U.S. We're going to learn a lot about that integration here. We feel very comfortable with it as it has been through [indiscernible]. But you put the LMR out in the market to see the product in the wild, right, and make sure you're happy with it, make sure customers are having a great experience. And we'll learn from that LMR in a way that will allow us to accelerate G7 in the U.S. and then internationally. We haven't guided the timing on anything outside of the US on G7 but the LMR is important in that way. Very similarly, we're looking to be able to accelerate our LMR for the Libre 2 Plus integration in Europe and working hard to get that to market. The experience we're having right now with the RADIANT trial, which is our Libre integration trial in Europe suggest that that's a great wear experience for customers as well. And so you can see we're accelerating that LMR in Europe. We'll learn from that LMR too. So -- and we haven't given any timing guidance on Libre for the U.S., but you can see what we're doing is we're kind of parallel processing the 2 LMRs to maximize our learning and kind of optimize our resource use across the geographies, if that makes sense. Very high priority for us to get sensor integrations up and running to give choice and also because what we want to do is we're really prioritizing making sure that customers that want to be on Omnipod 5 can get on Omnipod 5. And that's our top priorities to drive this. It's really -- it's proven on -- Omnipod 5 has proven to be a revolutionary offer. Lots of people want to be on Omnipod 5. So we're working hard to make sure we get the sensors integrated as quickly as we can into the various geographies as quickly as we can to provide that kind of access and option to customers and working hard to optimize the way we're doing it, so we can maximize our learning in time to market. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Jayson Bedford : Just on international, is your expectation that you'll be able to capture price with OP5? And then kind of what is the gating factor here in not launching into -- and launching into new European geographies a little quicker than fully by year-end. Jim Hollingshead : Yes, Jason, great question. It has been -- we've talked about this consistently in the past. So what we want to do with Omnipod 5 is generate the evidence we need, which is we're doing with our G6 RCT, which I mentioned in the comments we're doing with our RADIANT trial. We're generating the evidence we need to establish Omnipod 5 as a first-line offering and then go and negotiate for reimbursement across our international markets. Reimbursement levels that are commensurate with the extra value we're creating with the Omnipod 5 offering. And so our goal is to drive a price premium. It's a little bit different from what we did in the U.S. because when we launched Omnipod 5 in the U.S., we launched it into the pharmacy channel, pricing parity with DASH because we knew that would streamline time to full coverage in the market. So we got to full coverage. In the European markets, what we need to do is make sure we're negotiating kind of reimbursement body. It's different in every market, and there's tenders, there's ministries of health and so on, but we need to negotiate those market by market, but we have to generate the evidence that's required to be able to have that conversation. So far, we've been very successful with that. So working in the U.K., we're very comfortable with where we've landed with reimbursement levels in the U.K., working in Germany and so on. And so we're going to continue to drive that and work really hard to achieve a premium for Omnipod 5 everywhere we launch it. And then remind me the second part of your question, it was all the gating factors. Gating factors, it's a little bit different by every market. Sometimes it's reimbursement -- sometimes it's sort of cloud connectivity. We've made a lot of progress on that latter technical front. And then it's just preparing for commercial launch and making sure that everything is lined up to do that. We're making terrific progress. And as we've said, I just want to clarify, actually, I think Jeff just said that we said we'd be in the majority of our markets. We haven't said that. What we've said is that by the end of 2024, there may be a technical problem on the call. What we said by the end of 2024, we will have the majority of our European customers have Omnipod 5 available. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : I wanted to follow-up on Travis' question on the guide. So I guess the crux, Lauren, of my question is, did anything change from the Q3 call and from JPMorgan. So you said the high end -- when you make these adjustments, you said the high end of this guidance implies mid-20s. So why the high end? I mean is there -- was there an incremental change? And I think you said at JPMorgan that new starts would grow year-over-year in 2024. I didn't hear that in your comments today. And I'm just curious, Lauren, your guidance philosophy in general, has anything changed from historically Insulet is guided pretty conservatively. Jim Hollingshead : Larry, we're having a technical problem on the call. And so I'm going to take my best shot at answering your question. And so on guidance, nothing has really changed from our guidance. I think that the guide we've given on revenue and on new customer starts, I mean, it's pretty consistent with the color we gave on the November call. And the big move is actually the unusual order pattern where we had $20 million to $25 million of revenue pulled forward. We're still guiding to ramping new customer starts in 2024. The change -- the only real change in the guidance that we're giving compared to color is that we're guiding to a 13% -- roughly a 13% operating margin for 2024, which is actually an increase from the color we gave on the November call. And there are a number of opportunities for us to do that. But we delivered really strong operating income through 2023 and actually exceeded what we had guided to for 2023 because if you remember our guide in 2023, it was high-single-digits, which you call it like 9.5% plus, and we ended up delivering well above that. And we're now guiding to 13%, which as Lauren explained in the prepared comments, represents 100 basis points over what we achieved at the end of 2023, but more than 200 basis points or roughly 200 basis points above what we would have achieved without the revenue pull forward. That 13% OI guide, is the only real change from the color we gave in November, if that makes sense. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Margaret Kaczor with William Blair. Margaret Kaczor : Wanted to maybe follow up on HCP prescribers. Obviously, that's a number that continues to grow quarter on quarter on quarter. Curious if you can provide any details around that? Are these folks routinely prescribing? Are you seeing growth in number of prescriptions? Maybe how does this compare to the number of pump prescribers in the U.S. And sorry, it's a long-winded question, but it really gets at this concept of how can you open up the part of the intensive insulin patient population, type 1 or type 2 that is being seen outside of the Endo's office and really scale that effort. Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Margaret. It's a great question. And again, I'll start and if Lauren wants to chime in on the back, I'd welcome that. Just to go back to context, we actually didn't put this in the prepared comments this quarter, but we've -- in the past, we've pointed out the endo market is somewhere around 70 -- 7,000 to 7,500 endos in the U.S. We know that a number of prescribers that we have are either endocrinologists themselves or their so-called physician extenders, which will include nurse practitioners and physician assistance, but we're clearly getting prescriptions beyond that. We're clearly getting prescription writing outside of endo practices, in PCP practices and in smaller practices, and that dynamic continues to grow, and we can see it in our own data. We don't have perfect insight into it out of the various available data. But we can see we're reaching more and more health care practitioners. And that's we believe we're doing that through word of mouth, through our promotion activities, which include both direct-to-patient activities and also direct-to-physician promotional activities online. And then the other thing I'll say is that it's been very, very powerful for us, sort of along the same lines. The Omnipod GO commercial pilot has proven to be a terrific investment for us this year because what we're learning -- we're learning a lot more about what happens in the primary care channel for people living with diabetes. And just a couple of things we're seeing, we've learned a lot about the target patient population for Omnipod, we've learned that primary care practices when they think pump, they think the [indiscernible] thing with a tube that they would never prescribe and then when they see Omnipod, there's a little bit of a head dynamic, and they say, \"Wait, you know what, that's so easy. My patients could do that. We could do that.\" And so we're very confident we're going to be able to drive demand for the Omnipod platform across primary care. And I think we're seeing more type 1 patients than we anticipated in the primary care channel. So to your point, we're very optimistic that as we continue to drive learnings out of our Omnipod Go pilot, we're going to be able to find a new kind of new avenues for driving demand for Omnipod and really driving pod therapy -- Omnipod therapy into the world where patients need it most. And so we're very optimistic about that. And so we continue to see that trend as a positive signal for us, but we're really excited about what we're learning out in the world with our commercial pilot as we go. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Josh Jennings with TD Cowen. Josh Jennings : I was just hoping to better understand pricing dynamics through the pharmacy channel in the U.S. for Omnipod 5 and DASH. Was reimbursement stable that Insulet was receiving for Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH in \u201823? And how should we factor in reimbursement levels and pricing for Omnipod 5 and DASH in 2024? Lauren Budden : Yes. So really, it's more about a volume business at this point. We did get a big price lift throughout 2023 from the conversions into the pharmacy channel. But as we've mentioned previously, those conversions are largely complete by this point. So we're not seeing that going forward. We did have a price increase like we normally do in early September, which was pretty minimal. It's just under 3% kind of in line with the cost of living adjustment. So just keep in mind there, though, we don't see the full benefit of that because some of it goes to the DDM in terms of rebates and to the wholesaler fees. So at this point, for 2024, I would pretty much say that you should focus on the volume, not the price has leveled off. The great news is that we are getting that continued price lift going forward, but it shouldn't be an incremental change. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with Citi. Unidentified Analyst : This is Anthony on for Joanne. 2024 is kind of investment year, maybe 2025 as well. But can you talk over the longer term, 2026 and beyond where gross margins and operating margins potentially could go and how you get there? Lauren Budden : Yes, I'm happy to start off and then Jim feel free to add on. Yes, we definitely feel like we have room for expansion, both on margin and gross margin in the near term and in the longer term. We did great in Q4, and we have lots of opportunities as we're setting up with the product launches that we have this year that will accelerate the top line and be able to allow us to drop more through. We haven't put out guidance beyond 2024, but we are planning on doing a long-range plan later in this year. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler. Matthew O'Brien: It is going to be one question, I promise. The first part is just more clarification kind of to Larry's question earlier, but I'm looking at the stock down kind of mid- to upper single digits in the aftermarket. I think it's on this guidance commentary. And again, the high end of the range gets you to that 25%. Was it a street modeling issue at 25% versus where it should have been 23%, 24%. I'm just making sure there's nothing competitively or pharmacy related that we should really be worried about? And then the real question is, Jim, when you guys came out with O 5, I think you went from 80/20 MDI to competitive conversions all the way to 60-40, and then it went to 70-30, now we're back to 80-20. Is it getting tougher and tougher to take those competitive conversions? And with G7, do you think that will start to get a little bit better, a little bit easier throughout the course of this year? Jim Hollingshead : Why don't -- we'll have Lauren start on the guide and then I'll pick up on the competition. Go ahead, Lauren. Lauren Budden : Sure. So for 2024, even with the significant volume benefit that we realized in '23, we're guarding to very strong revenue growth. We expect to achieve almost $2 billion in revenue and our guide represents $300 million of revenue growth in terms of dollars. So your question in terms of what changed from the call we provided, it was really just that revenue shift of 20 million to 25 million of orders that were -- would have been Q1 but were placed in advance of our ERP implementation. So the estimated impact of that is 3 points on the total company and 4 points on U.S. Omnipod. So overall, our guide is strong. And as we've mentioned, we have many catalysts for growth in '24 that's going to help accelerate it and particularly in the back half with those new customer starts and provide strong revenue growth for the year and into 2025 and beyond. Deborah Gordon : I'm sorry, Jim. I was just going to say that, you nailed it. I thought I heard you say that U.S. The Street is modeling now 25% on a normalized basis. So if I got that right that you said that the U.S., that's exactly right for the year on a normalized basis. And Lauren nailed it when she said the 4-point impact. So when Lauren provided some color on the Q3 call that we would be in mid-20s to referring to 24 to 26 around there. And at the midpoint, we're spot on what we were expecting for U.S. And that's about -- if you do the math, about 21% on a normalized basis for total Omnipod and it gets you to the total company growth of 20%. So it's spot on from the color that Lauren gave in November. We just didn't expect that shift, which is the $20 million to $30 million shift that happens, ends up or $20 million to $25 million ends up being double, right, to the 40 to 50 because it's comes out of one year and goes into the other. So that's where actually she was trying to normal set. So hopefully, that answers your question on that piece. Sorry, Jim Jim Hollingshead : And we can always clarify this offline, right? So -- but it's a decrease in the denominator, increase in the numerator for '24, you get the normalized number, right? So it's a double whammy in that $20 million to $25 million. So the underlying guide remains the same, respectively. On the competition, yes, we continue to have really good new customer starts. And historically, we always had 80/20 of MDI and competitive switching. After the launch of Omnipod 5, we obviously caught a lot of competitive switchers, and we've done really, really well. We continue to have. So if you think about pre-Omnipod-5 and that 20% of competitive switches and with Omnipod 5 and 20% of competitive switchers, it's a larger number than it was, right? So because new customer starts are up overall, so we continue to do very, very well. And the underlying dynamic there is we also retain the vast majority of customers that we get from competitors. Retention is very, very strong. And we said that, we do think -- we had the benefit now of hearing our two competitors' calls, and we have the benefit of seeing what's happening out in the market. We don't see -- there's little things around the edges, I would say. We don't see any fundamental underlying shift in the competitive dynamic. Omnipod 5 continues to be the preferred product. But I would say that one of our competitors has done a better job of staunching the bleeding in their installed base. And so you can see a little bit of that dynamic going on in the market. But we're still clearly the preferred offer -- clearly winning with MDI and just winning with new customer starts overall very, very clearly in the market. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Kratky with Leerink Partners. Mike Kratky : So you've capitalized on having a competitive advantage in type 2 with broad pharmacy access. How are you planning on defending that position in the market as we start to see additional pumps expand into the pharmacy channel on both a near-term basis and then looking ahead to 2025? Jim Hollingshead : Great question. Thank you. Pharmacy is -- our offer -- the Omnipod platform offer is much better suited to the pharmacy channel than tubed pumps are, much, much better suited. 2 pumps at the end of the day, continue to be durable equipment. And there's all kinds of things that I can go into the weeds here and talk about this, but I'll just say it's not a surprise that we see competitors trying to figure out how to get in the pharmacy channel with a durable tube pump because we've been so successful in establishing the pharmacy channel for AID. And as we would expect, competitors are -- we've established market leadership across basically the whole range of our offer and competitors are going to chase that. It's -- there's -- what we've learned is, there's a very big learning curve in pharmacy. It's very, very different from the DME channel, the economics work better for us because there's -- in all cases, the value is actually in the pump, whether it's a durable pump or it's the pod. And the fact that the value is created in our consumable, which is the pod gives us an inherent advantage as we -- it starts to get a little abstract, but it gives us an inherent advantage as we're in that channel. Couple that with the fact that we have very, very wide coverage in the pharmacy channel, we have established contracts across the PBMs. And we've had very successful growth with all of our PBM partners. We think we have a very defensible position there. People who use insulin go into the pharmacy to get their insulin, whether they're getting it from retail pharmacy. So it's a great place for them to also get their AID-pump therapy and Omnipod continues to be very uniquely positioned and the value prop of Omnipod in the pharmacy channel will continue to be very uniquely positioned as we go forward. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Chris Pasquale with Nephron. Chris Pasquale : Jim, your comments on what you've learned so far from the GO LMR were really interesting. It sounds like that's going pretty well. But I think I heard the guidance really doesn't assume any benefit from GO in '24, which makes it sound like a full launch isn't planned anytime soon. How are you thinking about the timing for a full launch? And what's really the gating factor there? What boxes do you need to check before you're ready to expand the commercialization? Jim Hollingshead : Yes, great question. The way to think about Omnipod GO is that we hear a different language about this. And I'd just be really clear, we're not in limited market release with GO, we're in a commercial pilot, right? And so that's a step before -- I think I said this last quarter on our call as well, that's a step before an LMR. The product itself is ready. It's out on patients, it's fully approved. We continue to grow coverage for it. So that's a step but we're ahead of schedule and coverage. So the way to think about the Omnipod GO commercial pilot is the gating factor is not timing, it's learning, right? So what we're using it for is to establish the right commercial model, both for GO and for the primary care chain. And one of the reasons we're so excited about the pilot is that we are learning an awful lot out of that pilot. And so -- and where we're going to land on this thing, whether we commercialize in '24 with GO or commercialize -- get to more of an FMR in '24 or sometime in '25, where we're going to land is we're going to be in the primary care channel first and second, one way or another, we're going to have call points in primary care. And the other thing is we will have the broadest offering for people living with type 2 diabetes who need insulin delivery. So we're already the market leader with DASH in that space very clearly. We know -- we have our pivotal trial going to Omnipod 5. As we said before, we know Omnipod 5 is actually being used off label. In a lot of cases, we're not promoting Omnipod 5 off-label, but we'll have -- our goal is to have the label for Omnipod 5 in the short order coming out of our pivotal trial, and we continue to have a plan to file with the FDA for that label extension in '24, and we'll have Omnipod GO. And that gives you the whole coverage for people using insulin with type 2 all the way from I'm initiating basal insulin 2, I'm using intensive insulin. And so we'll have that full portfolio of products, and we'll have a very clear way to commercialize that in both primary care and in the endocrinology channel. So that's why I'd say I'm very excited about the commercial pilot with Omnipod GO. We are learning the ton and it's going to make us much better commercially as we get into that and get that full portfolio on market. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Steve Lichtman with Oppenheimer. Steve Lichtman : As you start opening up the opportunity here to the Libre platform outside the U.S. and then in the U.S., can you give us your latest thoughts on the size of that opportunity. There's been estimates on what that new opportunity set looks like. It would be great to get your latest color on that. Jim Hollingshead : Yes. We think it's a really big opportunity. If you look at the sensor market, you've got millions of people using Dexcom sensors and millions of people using Abbott's sensors. So the G6, G7 family products and the Libre 2 and Libre -- now emerging Libre 3 family products by creating the integration across that range. So prioritizing G7, prioritizing Libre 2 plus and then 3 that we're working in parallel. It opens up a really large substantial market for us. The two -- we love working with both of our partners. They both have great technology. They're both really good partners. Development pathway with both of them is really strong. They're slightly -- they have slightly different positions in the main geographies of the U.S. and Europe in terms of their installed base, but both of them have very large installed bases. And both of them have, as we've always said, CGM pays road for us because people get used to having an on-body experience with a sensor and it makes it much easier for them to then jump to an on-body experience with an Omnipod. And so we think it opens up -- you can go look at the market share, the estimated market share for our two partners, but we think the Libre integrations open up a large installed base both in Europe and the U.S. of people who will be ready for Omnipod because they're used to a on-body CGM experience. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Marie Thibault with BTIG. Sam Eiber : Sam on for Marie. Maybe I can follow up on some of the type 2 comments. And just looking at pivotal data coming up at ADA and then filing for label expansion, how much of an uplift could that be once you do get the expanded label there? Just considering 20%, 25% of new patient starts are already coming from type 2? Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Sam. If you just look at the size of the end markets there, and I'll repeat numbers that we shared before. In the U.S., there are about 1.6 million people living with type 1 diabetes. And if that market is about, probably, something less than 40% penetrated with AID therapy. Then in the type 2 market, there are somewhere between 3 million and 4 million people living with type 2 who are on basal-only therapy. And somewhere around 2.5 million people living with type 2 in the U.S. who need intensive insulin therapy, so basal plus bolus. Omnipod 5 is really aimed at that intensive insulin therapy population, about 2.5 million people in the U.S. And therefore, it's a larger end market than Omnipod 5 plays in now with its current label. We know that, that market is less than 5% penetrated with AID therapy. And we are already the market leader in that segment of the market because Omnipod DASH has a label there, and we know we're the clear market leader in the space. So we're very optimistic. Omnipod 5 is very easy to use. It takes a lot of the burden off of managing your diabetes. That's why it's been so successful in the type 1 population. And we're very optimistic about that value proposition going into the intensive insulin using type 2 population, which is a larger end market than the one we're playing in today. So we think it is a really important opportunity and a market that, by the way, will continue to grow over time. Operator : We have time for one more question. Your final question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy with UBS. Danielle Antalffy : Just a question on the wholesaler stocking and that whole dynamic because it is something now we have to start thinking about in the model, But and I know it's unpredictable. But qualitatively, maybe you could talk about how much visibility you have into when that pod that gets stocked goes on to a patient. I guess trying to get a sense of is this something that's going to happen to this level every single quarter, if they're going off the shelves very quickly? How long do the stocking sort of fit on the shelf there? Lauren Budden : No. I mean it doesn't really stay on the shelf that long. I mean we -- it's a pretty efficient channel. In terms of the visibility into the date on hand though that's not something that we ever included in our guidance, and that's something that we can't control. And so unfortunately, this quarter, we had the double whammy of them taking the inventory level back up after they had taken them down earlier in the year. And then at the same time, we had the ERP pull forward dynamic. So I don't expect that we'd see something of that magnitude. But again, when we have something like this, what we do is, we call out and we tell you when it happens, we don't have the ability to guide to it. It's not something in our control. Operator : And we do have time for one more question. That question will come from the line of Matt Miksic with Barclays. Matt Miksic : Great. So maybe a bit of a 2-parter good news and maybe challenging news question, if I could, just at the end, is -- you had mentioned that you're looking for acceleration on the back of [indiscernible] G7 integration. And I mean given the new patient share that you're catching now, I just would ask maybe what's -- it's very high growth, and it's very high share of new patients. What additional patients do you get with G7 that you're not already capturing and in the advantage that you seem to be having in the clinic? And then the other question is looking out a year, 18 months or so, not certain, of course, but it certainly seems like there's going to be, at some point, another tubeless pump on the market from one of your competitors or more. And so maybe just think about your -- how do you think about that? And how do you prepare for that? How do you look to continue your leadership in that segment? And how should we -- investors think about that if I can grow potentially. Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Matt. I'll do those in reverse order. The first one is on the tubeless form factor. We obviously watch our competitor pipelines as closely as we can. And in terms of what is out there publicly that we can see, we don't see anything coming in that time frame that's even close to what we have in market right now with Omnipod 5, just in terms of the whole package, the convenience, the ease of use, the scalability, the wear experience, automated needle insertion, we could go on and on about the feature set that we are very confident in our competitive position. We're never complacent. We have a lot of respect for our competitors, and we know that what -- because Omnipod in general, but Omnipod 5 has been so successful, everybody wants to chase it. So that just makes sense, and that's how competition works. But we are very confident in our competitive position, and we don't see anything coming in anybody's pipeline that even matches what we have, and we're going to continue to drive innovation. So we're going to extend our lead. On the first part of your question, it's a really good question. Yes. We're obviously doing very, very well in the market with our existing offer. And as I said in the prepared remarks, it's really -- we really see it as our minimum viable product, and we've done so well with it. But on specifically the G6 and G7, what you're seeing and it's -- you can go look analytically at the underlying script data, what you're seeing is G7 is really doing well with new customer starts. So a lot of people going on to G7. And you guys have heard this is probably corny but you've heard me use the metaphor before, about fishing. If you think we're out fishing in the stock pond, the pond has a lot of G6 in it, but it's got more and more G7 in it all the time. And so we want to be able to go out there and fish in both bonds and proportionally, G7 is a larger and larger part of the market. We want to -- now I'm going to mix metaphors. We want that wind at our back of all the patients coming under G7. We know the offer together, Omnipod 5 and G7 is going to be terrific and drive a lot of growth for us just like Omnipod 5 with G6 had. Operator : This concludes our Q&A section. I would like to turn the conference back to Jim Hollingshead. Jim Hollingshead : Thank you, everybody, for joining us today. We are really excited to have delivered another outstanding year for Insulet. We're focused on extending our leading position with our deep expertise and strong emphasis on innovation, operational excellence and further improving the customer experience. We remain committed to driving value for our shareholders through margin expansion and cash flow generation, all while maintaining our emphasis on investing for growth. I also want to once again thank our outstanding Insulet global team for their dedication and their focus on innovation and passion to our customers. Thank you, everybody. And with that, I'll thank you all and wish you all a great evening. Good night, everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Insulet Corporation First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations. Deborah Gordon : Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Insulet's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. With me today are Jim Hollingshead, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ana Maria Chadwick, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Both the replay of this call and the press release discussing our first quarter results and 2024 guidance will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Also on our website is our supplemental earnings presentation. We encourage you to reference that document for a summary of key metrics and business updates. Before we begin, we remind you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such statements. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely adjusted gross and operating margins, adjusted EBITDA and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth excluding the effect of foreign exchange. These measures align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance from period to period, and we believe they are helpful for others as well. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis with the exception of revenue growth rates, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim. James Hollingshead : Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Coming out of the 2023 that saw Insulet emerge as the clear industry leader, we entered 2024 with significant momentum. We were off to a great start in Q1, fueled by continuing strong demand for Omnipod 5. Our global Insulet team continues to execute at a high level, bolstering our confidence in another year of robust revenue growth and margin expansion. Our first quarter revenue results exceeded our expectations for every product line. Given those results and the cascade of innovations that we plan to deliver this year, we have increased our guidance for both top line and operating margin growth. On today's call, I want to do 3 things : provide a high-level review of our Q1 results and the continuing strength of our competitive position in the market; give an update on our broad innovation agenda for 2024 including our efforts to expand the Omnipod 5 platform and our progress in the type 2 market; and discuss our ongoing efforts to capture the value of scale across our business.  Starting with financial performance. Our first quarter revenue and margins exceeded our expectations. We achieved total Omnipod revenue growth of 21%, including U.S. growth of 23% and international growth of 15%. In the U.S., we continue to build on our clear leadership in the market, and our Omnipod 5 automated insulin delivery system was #1 in new customer starts by a wide margin. Demand for Omnipod 5 remains very high, and U.S. new customer starts were robust and in line with our expectations. Omnipod 5 is designed to expand the market through its ease of use and easy access, and we continue to succeed in driving market growth. During the quarter, roughly 85% of our new starts came from people previously using multiple daily injections, our target market, and our competitive conversions remained very strong. The Omnipod platform also remains the top choice for people with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Type 2 patients represented roughly 25% of our new starts in the quarter. Omnipod 5 continues to be the game-changing offer we thought it would be when we first brought it to market. This is true in the U.S. and also internationally, where it is dramatically accelerating our growth. Last year's successful launches in the U.K. and Germany continued to exceed our expectations as our teams generate strong new customer starts. In fact, in Q1, more than half of our total international new customer starts were Omnipod 5. Given Omnipod 5's early contribution in our European markets, we are raising our international revenue outlook by 500 basis points to a range of 12% to 15%. As a result, we now expect total Omnipod growth of 19% at the high end and 18% for total company, representing a milestone of $2 billion in total company revenue. Ana will provide more details on our increased guidance in a few moments. Our global results in Q1 make one thing very clear. Omnipod 5 is, without a doubt, highly differentiated and the best offer on the market. Its ease of use, pay-as-you-go economics, affordability and widespread access make it the obvious choice for insulin delivery for people with type 1 diabetes and soon for people with type 2 diabetes once we achieve label expansion. Omnipod 5 leads the market everywhere it goes, and we are not stopping there. During Q1, we made significant strides across our innovation portfolio. Because Omnipod 5 is the market leader, it's easy to forget that the current version remains our initial minimum viable product. In 2024, we will expand on the Omnipod 5 platform by bringing new sensor integrations, launching the system in new geographies and extending our phone control offering. In the U.S. during Q1, we entered limited market release of our integration with Dexcom's G7 and are on track for full market release this summer, which will allow us to expand choice for customers and capture the opportunity created by the growth and adoption of Dexcom's latest sensor. In Europe, we successfully entered limited market release of our integration with Abbott's FreeStyle Libre 2 Plus sensor in both the U.K. and the Netherlands, ahead of our midyear launch plans. This release represents 2 firsts. Omnipod 5 is the first AID system to offer integration with the Libre 2 sensor in Europe, which is Abbott's most widely adopted CGM. And Omnipod 5 in the Netherlands represents our first sensor of choice pod offering. These pods are compatible with both Abbott's Libre 2 Plus and Dexcom's G6 sensor. Early results from the U.K. and the Netherlands are extremely promising, and we look forward to providing future updates with regard to the timing of full market release. Staying in Europe, we are pleased to announce that we now plan to launch Omnipod 5 with G6 in France also this summer. France has historically been one of our largest markets and one in which we know demand for our solutions is high. When we first launched Omnipod DASH in this market, it quickly became the insulin pump brand of choice, and we are confident in our ability to drive strong adoption with our advanced AID system. With the launch in France, we will achieve our stated goal of making Omnipod 5 accessible to the majority of our European customers and reach this milestone ahead of our internal end-of-year expectations. We anticipate our recent Omnipod 5 international launches will fuel accelerated new customer starts in the second half of this year and revenue growth next year and beyond. We also plan to enter our U.S. limited market release for our iOS app this summer. Extending Omnipod 5 onto the iPhone platform is one of our most frequently requested features, and we are excited to bring this offer to market. Turning to the opportunity in type 2 diabetes, where we remain the U.S. market leader in this large and underserved patient population. The commercial pilot with Omnipod GO, our FDA-cleared offering for the over 3 million people in the U.S. who need daily basal-only insulin, continues to offer significant learnings. Because of our pilot efforts, we have developed a better understanding of this market, and we have expanded the definition of targeted patient segments. We now also have even greater confidence that we will be able to bring our innovative technology to a broader range of HCP and physician practices. We are refining our plans for extended commercial reach based on those learnings. We also know that there is significant current demand for solutions that support intensive insulin use for people with type 2 diabetes. In this market, Omnipod DASH continues to perform extremely well driven by its ease of use and accessibility. In that context, we are very excited about the progress we are making towards achieving FDA clearance for Omnipod 5 for type 2.  During Q1, we reached a key milestone in our SECURE-T2D pivotal trial with the last patient completing the protocol. We are well on track to meet our goal of submitting to the FDA for label expansion by the end of the year. Once cleared, we expect to meaningfully accelerate Omnipod 5 adoption among the approximate 2.5 million people with insulin-intensive type 2 diabetes. And we will have the broadest offering of insulin delivery technology solutions on the market for this important patient population. Lastly, we continue to analyze the market impact of GLP-1 use. Analysis of actual claims data demonstrates that GLP-1 use accelerates the adoption of insulin among people living with type 2 diabetes. The data are definitive and striking and strengthen our conviction in the size of the unmet need and the size of the business opportunity for our growing type 2 portfolio. We are finalizing our analysis and look forward to providing a more detailed update soon. 2024 is shaping up as we planned to be a year filled with a cascade of innovations that will allow us to build on our position and market leadership, and we will take advantage of those innovations because of our expanding scale. Our business continues to enjoy several advantages that we've achieved through commercial scope and operational scale. First, our products have very broad reimbursement with more than 95% of covered lives in the U.S. for both Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH. And through our nationwide distribution reach, Omnipod is available at retail pharmacies that are within 5 miles of over 85% of the U.S. population. Our strategy to increase awareness of Omnipod with endocrinologists and primary care physicians has resulted in an expanded base of health care providers writing scripts for our products, fueling our leadership position. In the U.S., in Q1, the number of U.S. Omnipod 5 prescribing HCPs grew to over 20,000, up from over 18,500 the prior quarter. These prescribers were endocrinologists, PCPs and other HCPs, and the split was approximately 1/3 each. And the prescribers span both the type 1 and type 2 markets, and both increased substantially year-over-year. In order to fuel our growth, we are further expanding our commercial reach. Internationally, we continue to prudently invest in our commercial expansion and in our market access capabilities. In the U.S., we are in the process of incrementally expanding our sales force, including the creation of new territories and expansion into targeted pediatric centers. Our broad sales, marketing and channel capabilities allow us to reach a large and growing population of patients and represent a growing set of advantages over aspiring competitors.  Lastly, we also enjoyed significant financial benefits from our scaled manufacturing. Insulet has been on a 20-year journey of capability building and continuous improvement, which has allowed us to build world-class capabilities to drive ongoing quality and productivity. Manufacturing scale and scope have been big drivers of our gross margin expansion over that time, and we expect our new Malaysia facility will fuel continued efficiency gains. We are in the final stages of validating our manufacturing lines in Malaysia and expect to begin producing salable product in Q3. The facility represents a sizable investment of approximately $200 million over the course of 4 years through 2026, provides approximately 400,000 square feet of manufacturing space and is expected to house more than 1,000 full-time employees at full capacity.  Our regional sourcing strategy includes using local suppliers for components contributing to resiliency and improved costs. This facility will also strengthen our global operational capabilities, drive increased capacity to meet our robust demand and support future international market expansion. We expect our Malaysia site to be accretive to gross margin in its first full year of production ramping over time. It represents one of the many opportunities we have to lower total landed product costs and expand margins over the near and long term. Our advantages in scope and scale put Insulet in a strong position to continue to invest in the growth of our business and to expand our margins. This is yet another way in which our business is unique among our direct competitors. With that, I'll introduce Ana, who is joining us for her first call as our CFO. As you will have seen in our announcement, Ana is a highly accomplished and proven leader. We are thrilled to have her join the Insulet team, and I'm personally looking forward to benefiting from her partnership as we execute our strategy to drive rapid growth and strengthen our financial profile. Over to you, Ana. Ana Chadwick : Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I dive into the first quarter financial results, I want to say how excited I am to be part of this outstanding company. Insulet is transforming diabetes management and improving the lives of hundreds of thousands of people while driving strong financial performance. I am confident that we're just getting started, especially with the exciting developments in our pipeline. I look forward to partnering with Jim, our skilled leadership and the rest of Insulet's talented global team to advance our mission for our customers while also delivering robust revenue growth, margin expansion and shareholder value. And above all else, I look forward to helping make a positive impact on people around the world with diabetes. Now on to our first quarter results. First quarter exceeded our expectations, and we generated strong global new customer starts. As a result of our growing customer base, we delivered 23% revenue growth driven by global Omnipod growth of 21%, and our estimated global retention and utilization trends remain stable. Foreign currency was a 50 basis point tailwind for our total revenue on a reported basis compared to first quarter last year. U.S. Omnipod revenue growth was 23%, driven by robust growth on both type 1 and type 2 diabetes customer bases as well as expanding volume through the pharmacy channel. Adoption of Omnipod 5 integrated with G6 continues to be the driving force, and we are excited to have launched our U.S. limited market release with G7, which we expect will accelerate new customer starts in the second half of this year, following our planned full market release this summer. Our U.S. business and related revenue growth are very strong, fueled by Omnipod 5 success and robust demand. With many catalysts ahead of us this year, we're laying the foundation for sustained revenue growth for 2024 and beyond. International Omnipod revenue increased 15%, which was well above our expectations. While Omnipod DASH remains the largest percentage of our overall international volume, last year's Omnipod 5 launches in both the U.K. and Germany continue to drive notable increases in new customer starts and were the primary drivers of our accelerated growth. On a reported basis, foreign currency was 210 basis point tailwind over the prior year, which was approximately 110 points favorable versus our guide. Drug Delivery revenue was almost $9 million, which was above our guidance range due to timing. Gross margin was 69.5%, up 230 basis points on a reported basis and up 460 basis points compared to prior year adjusted gross margin. The increase in gross margins, which exceeded our internal expectations, was primarily due to volume growth in the U.S. pharmacy channel with a premium on the pods as well as our International Omnipod revenue performance and improved manufacturing efficiencies.  While operating expenses increased in the quarter as we invest in our business, including multiple product launches globally, the timing of some expected spend shifted into the remainder of the year. We will continue to invest to drive above-market growth while remaining committed to expanding operating margins through improvements in gross margin as well as efficiencies throughout our global business. Operating margin was 12.9%, and adjusted EBITDA was 20.2% of revenue, both exceeding our expectations, primarily due to higher-than-expected revenue and gross margin as well as timing of spend.  Turning to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with approximately $750 million in cash and the full $300 million available under our credit facility. As anticipated, our increased efforts to drive profitable growth are translating into expanding margins and a stronger overall financial profile.  Now turning to our 2024 outlook. For the full year, we're raising expectations for total Omnipod revenue growth to a range of 15% to 19% and total company revenue growth to a range of 14% to 18%. For U.S. Omnipod, we are raising the low end of our guidance and now expect a range of 17% to 21% revenue growth. We expect growth to be driven by strong Omnipod 5 adoption, which provides the benefits of reoccurring revenue stream due to our annuity model. We continue to anticipate both revenue dollars and new customer starts in the second half of 2024 to be higher than levels in the first half of 2024, consistent with normal historical seasonality trends. Additionally, our planned U.S. full market release of Omnipod 5 with G7 this summer is expected to contribute to the acceleration of new customer starts in the back half of the year. We are well positioned to accelerate new customer starts this year, which we expect will drive further revenue growth next year and beyond. We have massive market opportunities not only from further type 1 MDI penetration but also as we continue to penetrate the type 2 market. We are building a type 2 product portfolio and are excited to have this be one of our accelerated growth drivers over the near and long term. For International Omnipod, we are raising our revenue growth expectations by 500 basis points to a range of 12% to 15%. On a reported basis, we now assume an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 100 basis points. We expect growth to be driven by last year's Omnipod 5 launches in the U.K. and Germany, partially offset by headwinds in the countries where we do not yet have Omnipod 5. The substantial rate in our international revenue outlook reflects the outperformance of new customer starts and revenue since we launched Omnipod 5 in the U.K. and Germany, and to a lesser extent, the additional launches in 2024. We originally expected revenue growth in the first half of the year to be in the high single digits. With our revised outlook, we now expect first half growth of 13% to 15% and similar second half year-over-year growth profile, also up from prior expectations. We expect our recent Omnipod 5 launches in 1Q to contribute to new customer starts in the second half of the year and given the nature of our annuity model to more meaningfully contribute to our revenue growth in 2025. We have strong momentum internationally, and we are confident that Omnipod 5 will drive growth and share gain in every market in which we launch. For both the U.S. and International Omnipod, we expect quarterly revenue fluctuations resulting from the many product launches we have in 2024. This includes ramping inventory in channels for new launches and reducing levels for prior Omnipod generations. We do not expect this to materially impact our full year outlook. Lastly, for Drug Delivery, we are reaffirming our expectations of a 50% to 60% decline. Turning to 2024 gross margin. We are reaffirming a range of 68% to 69%, closer to the midpoint of the range. While we have a number of opportunities that could result in further gross margin expansion this year, we want to be prudent with our expectations given risks that come with significant product launches and standing up a new manufacturing facility. We are in a fantastic position to continue driving further gross margin expansion over the near and long term, and we remain committed to doing so. We also have an increased commitment to drive operating margin expansion. While we continue to expect operating expenses to increase as we invest in R&D, clinical and our commercial launches, we now expect to drive some operating leverage as we capitalize on our efficiencies and economies of scale. As a result, we are raising our operating margin expectations to approximately 13.5%, up 50 basis points from our original expectations. Although we don't guide to our effective tax rate, I will provide color since our income continues to grow. Our first quarter effective tax rate almost doubled to approximately 6% due to changes in income distribution among our jurisdictions. Given the positive trend in our earnings, we may reach a point this year where we conclude that the valuation allowance we have against our net deferred tax assets is no longer needed. We estimate this would result in a $200 million noncash reduction of income tax expense in the period the release is recorded, which we would adjust out for non-GAAP purposes. Subsequently, our effective tax rate may increase to an estimated annualized operational run rate of approximately 20% for the near term. Turning to our second quarter 2024 guidance. We expect total Omnipod growth of 18% to 21% and total company growth of 15% to 18%. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect growth of 21% to 24%. Growth drivers include the ongoing adoption of Omnipod 5, bringing with it the advantages of U.S. pharmacy channel, continued strong new customer starts and the benefits of our annuity model. With our new customer starts momentum, we expect sequential growth in second quarter, partially offset by wholesalers taking down G6 pod inventory as we begin to ramp G7 pods. And we expect to see some meaningful second half sequential dollar growth for the many catalysts we discussed.  For International Omnipod, we expect growth of 12% to 15%, driven by the ongoing adoption of Omnipod 5 in our initial markets, partially offset by headwinds in countries where we do not have Omnipod 5. On a reported basis, we expect an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 200 basis points. Finally, we expect Q2 Drug Delivery revenue to be approximately $4 million to $5 million.  In conclusion, our strong first quarter results reflect continued successful execution of our strategy as well as robust new customer starts in both our U.S. and international markets. In my first few weeks at Insulet, I have been incredibly impressed with what the company continues to accomplish, and I am even more energized by the incredible opportunities that lie ahead, which are greater than I had envisioned before joining. We are well positioned and remain committed to delivering sustained revenue growth and margin expansion for the balance of this year and well beyond. With that, operator, please open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Margaret Kaczor Andrew with William Blair. Margaret Kaczor : Maybe just to start with kind of a big picture question. 2024 certainly seems like a year probably as active as you guys have been with new launches with an eye maybe towards 2025 acceleration in revenues as the new patient starts to accelerate in the back half of this year. So one, I guess, is that how you guys are thinking about it? And then two, is it too forward to think that as new patients start to accelerate in the back half, those can add a step change in new start growth? Or is it going to be more of a steady acceleration as you launch all of these different initiatives in the back half of this year? James Hollingshead : Thanks, Margaret. Great question. We think that the timing of the product launches is really critical to ramping over the course of the year in '24. And so that's why we're really excited to be in LMR and be able to say that we anticipate full release of G7 in the U.S. over the summer and to already be in LMR going really well with our sensor of choice offering with -- including the Libre 2 Plus in Europe. And we do think that both new customer starts continue to accelerate over the course of the year and revenue continues to accelerate, and we'll see the revenue results more strongly in the second half. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Robert Marcus : Congrats on a really nice quarter. Wanted to ask on what you're seeing competitively in the market, both in type 1 and type 2. Type 2 starts were particularly strong. It sounded like new patient growth wasn't a record but was still very robust, and I think it was expected to be below record given no G7 integration yet or Apple. But would love to hear how you feel you're doing competitively in terms of new patient share and any competitive switching? And also, if I could just tack on. I heard there was destocking in the second quarter. Was there any stocking or destocking in the first quarter? And how do we think about the dollar impact in the second quarter in the U.S.? James Hollingshead : I think there's a bunch of things. And let me start with the stocking question and then come back to the competitive question. So stocking, we're only ever going to call that out if there's something unusual. And channel -- the stock in the channel is back to normal. We don't see anything unusual happening, and we're not going to talk about that unless we ever see something change that we think changes the trend or whatever. So that dynamic is totally ordinary in the quarter. So on the competitive position, we feel really strong about our competitive position. We're very, very confident in our competitive position. New customer starts in the first quarter in the U.S. came in right in line with our expectations, and obviously, in Europe did really, really well, which led us to raise our guide. And I think competitively -- give me an opportunity to just say a little bit about how we see the dynamic, which I'll try to be concise with. In the U.S. in type 1, the bulk of the market is still on MDI, as you all know. So we estimate that, as we've said before, 40% of type 1 patients in the U.S. are using some sort of pump technology and 60% are not. Our offering in Omnipod 5 has been designed to convert people off of MDI onto our technology because it's so simple to use, simple to put on, simple to use, simple to stay on, easy to access, great economics and great clinical outcomes. And so that's why we always say MDI is our target market. And from a competitive positioning point of view, we win that battle very, very handily. We clearly lead the market in MDI. And it's really Omnipod 5 that's growing in the market in type 1 for technology because we have such a clear leadership position there. In the remaining 40% that's penetrated, you do see there's a portion of that market which does have some competitive switching. And what we see over and over again and again in this quarter is that we have the net winners in the competitive switching game, and that's a smaller part of the market to begin with. And then it's only a fraction of that market that's up for conversion at any given time because of the 4-year lock-in on the tubed pumps. But we are clearly the net winners in any kind of competitive switching dynamics. So in sum, we lead in type 1, clearly. We lead in type 2, clearly. We lead very clearly in MDI, and we win the competitive switching game in the installed base. And so we feel very confident. Omnipod 5 wins everywhere it goes. And we see that over and over again. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Baird. Jeffrey Johnson : Jim, maybe we can stay on that type 2 point, so forgive me if you've already talked about this, and I think put a good focus on it. But we've seen the ATTD data that suggests GLP-1s might bring heavy insulin users back down into that like 60, 65 unit a day range where you can put them on a pump. We know you guys have shown some strong real-world data on T2 time in range. So some of your competitors. So it sounds like the KOLs are starting to push more and more for getting these type 2 intensives on AIDs as well. And you guys especially have been investing in the primary care channel where I think a lot of that T2 care is delivered. So how close are we getting to the precipice of kind of this inflection in type 2 uptake? And I know it's been going up in your numbers the last few quarters. We can see that. But it seems like we're still maybe not there but getting real close to an inflection not just for the market but maybe your competitive positioning in there with O5 as well. James Hollingshead : Thanks, Jeff. Great question. We are really excited about the opportunity for AID in the type 2 market. And as we know, we're already the clear leader in that market with Omnipod DASH. So in the pump market with Omnipod DASH, very clear leader. And you all know we don't promote Omnipod 5 because we don't have the label. So we don't promote Omnipod 5 in the type 2 market. But it gets written off label fairly frequently, as you can kind of reverse engineer out of our numbers. That's why we're so excited to be getting so close to filing with the FDA for a label extension. Because right now, we're out in the market with one arm tied behind our back. And we have a very firm conviction that as we get that label extension, we'll be able to drive dramatic growth in the use of Omnipod 5 specific -- not just AID obviously but Omnipod 5 specifically in that market. So we're getting very close. As we said about the pivotal trial, we've not just completed enrollment, but we have last patient through the trial. So we're in the process of gathering, cleaning, the normal steps of pivotal. We're gathering, cleaning the data. We're preparing our FDA filing. We're well on track to file. We've given guidance that we will file by the end of the year. We are very well on track to do that. And based upon what we've seen from our competitors, we're clearly out in front of everybody else in that market. But also remember, Omnipod 5, the offering itself is going to be -- it has a very clear right to win in the type 2 space because of its ease of use, its discretion, its availability in the pharmacy channel, its great outcomes, which we'll demonstrate further with data in type 2. So we are very, very bullish on the type 2 market. It continues to be a very clear unmet need, and we feel like we have what will be the best offering in the market. And we'll probably be there first. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Polark with Wolfe Research. Michael Polark : Maybe a quick follow-up on type 2 there. Is it the expectation that we'll see data from the SECURE trial at ADA? James Hollingshead : Yes, Michael, thanks for the question. It's our intent to show data from the STeP trial at ADA and with a specific focus on showing the subset analysis of people who are on GLP-1s in that data. Yes. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Travis Steed with Bank of America. Travis Steed : I wanted to follow up on the Q2 guidance. It looks like the guidance you gave is sequentially down, but you said in the prepared remarks you expect sequential growth in the second quarter offset by the wholesalers taking down the G6 inventory. And curious if you could help quantify what that guide assumes for the impact of the G6 inventory piece so we can kind of get the underlying Q2 guidance. Ana Chadwick : Travis, this is Ana. Thanks for the question. I think the main point here is to take a step back, and as you look at the U.S., we not only reaffirmed our full year guidance. We actually are taking up the low end. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, as we have all these cascade of new product launches, both in the U.S. and international, we're making assumptions. And as we do that, the key here is to remember that we believe the second half will be greater growth than the first, but we continue to expect the growth. And I think to call the exact timing is we're giving our best estimate. But the key important thing is that we're raising overall guidance for revenue, including international and the low end in the U.S. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : Jim, I wanted to circle back on new patient starts in the U.S. I heard robust U.S. type 1 and type 2 new starts in Ana's prepared remarks. Were new patients starts up year-over-year in Q1 in the U.S.? And do you still expect new starts to grow year-over-year in 2024? And talk about why you see G7 as a driver of new starts growth in the second half of the year. James Hollingshead : Thanks, Larry. Year-over-year in Q1, overall new starts were not up, but MDI was up for us. So that gives you a sense of our strength in bringing customers out of MDI into the market. We expect sequential growth over the course of the year in new customer starts in the U.S. As I said before, I expect a record for us in the U.S. and globally in NCS for 2024. And what was the last part of your question, Larry? Larry Biegelsen : Just conceptually understand why G7 integration is a driver of that new start growth. James Hollingshead : Thank you very much. So G7 will be a tailwind for us once we get to full market release because of the nature of prescriptions, new customer prescriptions for CGM in the U.S. market. So I know you all look at this. But if you go look at new customer scripts for CGM, G7 has overtaken G6. And so you guys have always used -- heard me use this metaphor of fishing in a stocked pond. We've done obviously very, very well fishing in the G6 pond and have led the new starts with G6. And in the quarter, I think you can see from our new customer starts, it has not been a headwind for us to have the G7 out of the market and be so well adopted because what we found -- and with new customer starts right in line with our expectation, what we found is that if people want to be on Omnipod 5, they'll stay on the G6 or if they want to start AID on Omnipod 5, they go get a G6. So that hasn't been a headwind. But G7 will be a tailwind because there are more and more patients out there on a G7. And as we've said all along on the Omnipod 5 ride since we've launched, the CGM -- our CGM partners pave road for us. And so DexCom is now paving the road with G7. We need to get a car on that road, right? So that's why the timing of G7 launch is really important to us, and we want to get on market with it with full release as quickly as we can. And that's why we believe G7 will be a tailwind in the second half and will drive more new customer starts in the second half because we'll add G7 to the portfolio. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Wood with Morgan Stanley. Patrick Wood : You guys have mentioned a few times learnings in type 2 and that side of things. And so I guess my basic question is -- and I know you've been investing there, and you've just upped the guide on the margin side of things. But these are very different patients, and PCPs are very different and require a different amount of training. As we ramp through the back half of this year and into next year, do you think there's like an investment cycle again needed from you guys in driving that type 2 market, particularly on the service and sort of support side? James Hollingshead : Thanks, Patrick. It's a great question. That's part of the purpose of the commercial pilot, is to get out in the real world and see how those practices operate because historically, our call point has been endocrinology practices. And so we're out calling on primary care and specifically on primary care who, when you look at their scripting behavior overall with things like CGM and insulin, look more like endo practices than like true general practices, right? And so we've been out in the world calling on those practices to see how they manage patients, how they manage diabetes therapy. And we've learned a lot. And what we want to do out of that learning, coupled with the portfolio that we'll bring to market, is to figure out this -- kind of the term of the right selling motion. So that will include what's the right sales rep design, so the role description for that sales rep, what's the right support. Right now, we have quoted reps paired up with clinical service manager reps, who do both. Does that mix of rep look the same? Is it different? What's the reach? What's the so-called share of voice and design and commercial model? I think the reason we're so bullish on what we've learned out of the pilot is, first of all, as we've said in the past, Omnipod as a platform is so simple to use that often the phenomenon is when we walk into those practices and say, \"We're here to talk about an insulin pump,\" their first reaction is we don't do insulin pumps because they're too complicated. And then we show them Omnipod GO, and they say, \"Wait a minute. That's an insulin pump.\" And it's so simple to use that it leads to a more holistic conversation about insulin delivery. And often then they start to ask about basal/bolus solutions, which then leads us to talk about DASH. And so one of the key learnings is we think in those practices, there's an opportunity not just for Omnipod GO but ultimately for Omnipod 5 in intensive insulin therapy. And the other thing I think we're finding is that there's a range of patients out there. So I think the kind of stereotypical view is that type 1 patients are treated in endocrinology and type 2 -- a lot of type 2 patients are treated in general practice. But we're actually finding there's both in both. And so a lot of the intensive user -- intensive insulin using type 2 patients already in endocrinology, but we also see them in primary care. And we see actually a surprising number of type 1 patients being treated in primary care as well. So we think the opportunity there is different and more promising than when we initially launched the pilot, and we will be making a determination about the commercial model. And then in direct answer to your question, there probably will be some more investment in sales and support to capture it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Jefferies. Matthew Taylor : I guess I was wondering if you could comment on pump market growth just with all the enhancements going on with integrations and technologies across the space. Can you comment on whether you think the market growth is accelerating or you think it will accelerate in the coming quarters or next year? James Hollingshead : Thanks, Matt. We think that you can see the normal cyclicality in the market, but the market is growing, first. And there's 2 drivers of market growth. The first one is the widespread adoption of CGM. And the second big driver of market growth is Omnipod 5 because it makes it so simple to come on to AID. And so as we continue to lead in MDI with a very clear leadership in the MDI position, those MDI patients are market growth for AID, and we are leading the way there. So the technology itself is driving market growth, and our CGM partners are doing it, and we're leading the way in AID. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler. Phillip Dantoin : This is Phil on for Matt. And just to circle back to Travis' question from before because I'm not sure that was explicitly clear as it relates to Q2. For total Omnipod, can you confirm that Q2 growth will be sequentially up if you back out this wholesaler dynamic? And then just for some who are listening who might not be familiar, can you talk about the fact that G6 pods are different than G7 pods? James Hollingshead : Let me start on the pods, and then I'll ask Ana to comment, go back to the Q2 financials. So the G6, G7 pods, when we get to full release of -- for the G7 integration. Those will be backwards compatible pods. So the current pods only -- can only connect with G6. But when we launch G7, the G7 pods will be G7 and G6 pods and be backwards compatible. So what that will mean for a customer or a user is that if they want to stay on the G6, they'll be able to stay on the G6 because the pods will work with it, but it will also accept G7. And so it will be kind of a sensor of choice within the Dexcom family of CGM. Ana, do you want to take the... Ana Chadwick : Sure. Listen, I'll take another stab at here the 2Q guidance. And I just -- once again, I want to put it in overall perspective for the year. We're taking up our guidance in the U.S., even in the low end. And we expect overall that sequential growth to be there, as I stated. And I think the key point to mention here is we made our best assumption here as we have this transition of product out in the market. And we called our best estimate, and we will update as we progress through the year. But we feel very confident over the entire calendar year with the guide we've given. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Jayson Bedford : I guess I have a question on international. I think you mentioned that first and second half growth would be in the, I think you said, 13% to 15% range. Just given the annuity model, given the new products, geographies, why wouldn't second half growth be higher than first half? Ana Chadwick : Thank you for the question. Listen, as I mentioned here, we took the entire guidance up 500 basis points, and that's given what Jim referred to. I mean the adoption we're seeing on Omnipod 5 is phenomenal and great. We're going to be in more markets as well. And the markets -- all of these European markets have slightly different dynamics. Some of them are in 4-year cycles, so on and so forth. So we feel good with the guidance that we're giving. And in anything that's new, our goal and the philosophy of this team and my philosophy is we want to give you numbers that we could hit. We definitely don't want to miss. So that's kind of the philosophy in which the spirit -- and we felt the 500 basis point guide up was significant. We will learn a lot more as we go through the next few months and as we learn more of these launches, and we will update accordingly. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Lichtman with Oppenheimer & Co. Steven Lichtman : So yes, just building on that last question, you've given the annuity model. Really nice to see this near-term outperformance. And assuming it's led by steeper ramp in new starts, are there any new start metrics you can provide from outside of the U.S.? And are you getting a higher price point for O5 outside of the U.S., so this is a mix opportunity as well? James Hollingshead : Sure. We don't -- as you know, Steve, we don't give guidance on actual numbers and so on. But we did try to allude, I think, in the prepared remarks to the fact that Omnipod 5 is out of the gate so strong in the U.K. and Germany that already in Europe, more than half of our new customer starts are Omnipod 5. So that will give you some color on the strength of the adoption. We'll launch in France over the summer. And then the France -- we're in Netherlands in LMR, and we'll get to FMR in the Netherlands, and then we'll launch in France over the summer. And there's a ramp, as you all know, to the dynamic. And so that's how you should expect to see it. If we ramp in those countries the way we are, we'll see a revenue impact. And depending on how quickly we can get France actually launched, which will happen -- we've given summer as kind of a range. That will have more or less effect within the year. But we expect to have great adoption in France because Omnipod DASH has been so successful and it's so demanded by patients. So just to give you a color on kind of the starts dynamic for us. In terms of ASP, yes, we've been very successful in negotiating for a premium on Omnipod 5 relative to Omnipod DASH in our European markets. That's different from what we did in the U.S., as you know, where we launched Omnipod 5 effectively at price parity. But in Europe, we want to take advantage of the fact that Omnipod 5 is new technology, and that's been an important component of each individual country launches to go in and negotiate for reimbursement that's more commensurate with the value, the additional value that Omnipod 5 creates. And so there is a mix impact on revenue as we get Omnipod 5 into each of those markets. It's a little -- the actual premium itself is a little different by market. But so far, we've been very successful in securing a premium for Omnipod 5. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with Citi. Joanne\u00a0Wuensch : I have 2. And the first one is I want to make sure I have an idea of what to expect when Libre 2 is integrated with Omnipod 5 and how you think about launching that and uptake. And then the second one is in addition to the type 2 clinical data at ADA, what else should we be looking for? James Hollingshead : Thanks, Joanne. Libre 2, we're very excited. As you can imagine, we're very excited to get our Libre 2 integration into market in LMR. So far, we're having great results with the patient experience in both the U.K. and the Netherlands. And as you know, the Libre 2 form factor, that sensor for our partner, Abbott, is their most adopted sensor. And so it opens up an entirely new kind of side to the market for us, kind of serviceable addressable market, if you want to think in those terms of all of those Libre 2 users who may, therefore, also want to go on to an AID system in Omnipod 5. And Omnipod 5 is so simple to use, and the form factor is so great that we think it will have very high appeal to that Libre 2 user population. So we're very, very excited to get it out to market. Great to see the early results. Turning to GLP-1 and ADA data. There will be other things we'll show at ADA. We're going to show -- we'll show some subset analysis out of our pivotal trial. I'm sure we'll show an update on our real-world evidence, which has consistently shown that we deliver fantastic time in range, along with very low hypoglycemia in increasingly large populations of real-world data sets, and we'll have some other studies that we haven't yet discussed. No later than ADA, you should see us report an update on our analysis of GLP-1, which I alluded to briefly in our prepared comments. Because it's in real claims data, you can see that people who adopt GLP-1s are more likely to adopt insulin in the same year. And so we'll be documenting that with the robust presentation of the claims data, which is very exciting. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy with UBS. Danielle Antalffy : Congrats on a great start to the year. Just a quick question on the new patient starts from competitive switches. Jim, I know you guys talked last quarter about the fact that one of your competitors was holding on to their installed base a little bit more. Just curious what you -- has that gotten worse? You have another competitive launch happening. Wondering if they're also holding a little bit tighter to their installed base. And how do you see this evolving? Is this something that we should be thinking an 85-15 MDI competitive switch split? And I appreciate that MDI is the key to the growth story, but just curious about what you're... James Hollingshead : Yes, it's a great question, Danielle. The first thing I would say just quickly is, on the 85-15, that was actually a pretty subtle shift in mix. That is a mix percentage, and it was fairly subtle. And we tend to give you guys -- we have an estimation on that. We don't have perfect insight into those mix data that we give on MDI versus competitive T1, T2. There's kind of an estimation range in those. And so I wouldn't over-index on the modeling in what we reported. It was a pretty subtle shift. Having said that, what we see -- I can't really speak to the challenges our competitors face in retaining the customers in their installed bases. What we see consistently both with our own proprietary market research, which we put in place in the last few quarters, and also with third-party data is that we are the clear net winners in the competitive switch game. So if you're a manufacturer, you can typically get a sense of how many customers you're converting from, from a competitor. But you don't often have great insight into what your loss rate is. And so we put in place a market analysis that allows us to better estimate that. And it's a very consistent dynamic for us since we launched Omnipod 5 that we are the net winners in that game. So we gain way more customers than we lose, both head-to-head with our competitors and then obviously overall in the market. And so that just speaks to how strong our competitive position is with Omnipod 5. It's clearly the best offer on the market, and that's what the market says with those results. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Plovanic with Canaccord Genuity. William Plovanic : Just really wanted to go back to type 2 and Omnipod GO, and I don't know if I missed this. Did you give any detail on timing for full market release? And if not, are you kind of waiting for the O5 to be available before you roll out so you have a full product set? And then with the ATTD data with time in range on the AID, I was wondering if some of this data has been driving kind of a shift in the market there as well. James Hollingshead : Thanks, Bill. We haven't given timing on Omnipod GO. And obviously, we haven't yet filed Omnipod 5. And so the commercial pilot is intended to make sure that we have enough learning in place to put the right commercial model in place. And we'll figure out exactly how we'll bring the portfolio. So we have not updated on timing for Omnipod GO, but you can -- I think you can easily envision that with a portfolio of products, the commercial model looks different than with a single product, right? So I'll put it that way, I think. With the ATTD data, to me, the real-world evidence that we were able to show makes it really clear that the Omnipod 5 algorithm is a world-class algorithm. It produces fantastic results, clinical results. It produces it across age groups, across demographics. And as we've said before, one of the things that's unique about our real-world evidence is that it's from all comers. And so it's not only from highly engaged patients who upload their data. It's from all patients who are on Omnipod 5. And so when it has robust results, you can sort of see it as extra robust because it's a clear view into every corner of the user population. And on top of that, what it shows is we produce great time in range, as I said, but we continue to have very low hypoglycemia in our algorithm, which is a big competitive advantage for us. So that data is helping us now out in the field as we talk to physicians and continue to introduce Omnipod 5 to new users to demonstrate just how clinically effective Omnipod 5 is on top of and in addition to its great ease of use. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Marie Thibault with BTIG. Marie Thibault : I'll move away from the top line here and focus on margins. You had excellent operating margin again this quarter. I wanted to ask a little bit about the near-term cadence. Saw that you raised the guidance but also heard that you're expecting some incremental expansion of the sales force. So just any guidance on a quarterly cadence on that metric. Ana Chadwick : Yes, this is Ana. Thanks for the question. We're in a really strong position as we look at our operating margin. And I'll break it down. From a gross margin perspective, we did that 69.5%. That's very strong. We look to have strength on that as we progress through the year. Now from an operating perspective, what we need to balance out here is the investments because we want to really position ourselves into the future. And as Jim and I have talked, it is kind of a good problem to have. And we have a cadence around analyzing our investments and making sure there's that rigor of those returns. So as we sit here, yes, we see upward mobility here in our margins. And at the same time, we want to be prudent in our capital allocation to continue to fuel the growth, and as you mentioned here, the sales force and the different investments in our product and product features and other things. So it's a real balance, and we will continue to drive margins up as our priority and continue to prioritize our investments. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale with Nephron. Christopher Pasquale : Jim, I wanted to understand your GLP-1 comment better. The thesis around GLP-1 use in type 2 is that it would help those patients take a couple of steps back on the disease progression escalator, if you will. So maybe the insulin use can be delayed, or if they're already on insulin, they can use less. And now you're talking about the transition to insulin use actually being accelerated. So do you think being on a GLP-1 is really making them more likely to need insulin? Or is what you're picking up there just that these patients were not engaging with their disease previously and now they are and GLP-1s are the catalyst to get them more active? James Hollingshead : Yes. Great question, Chris. Yes, obviously, we'd be speculating. So just to -- and we'll be publishing an update that we'll give you one more detail. So I don't want to steal the thunder of what we'll put out. So you can also look at the slides, and we can have a better conversation about it. But I'd just say we'd have to speculate what's actually happening. It's -- the analysis is based on claims data. And so it's very robust. It's very large end claims data. And what it shows is that for those patients who adopt GLP-1, they are much more likely to also adopt insulin in the same year. And given what we see -- and so I'm not going to speculate just for a second, okay? Given what we see with GLP-1s, we know GLP-1s lower A1c. So I think the dynamic is more likely the second -- your second suggestion, which is patients go in, they get put on a GLP-1 because their A1cs are really high. And then either they drop off of the GLP-1, which we'll also have some information on that in our deck, or they stay on GLP-1, but they haven't resolved their A1c issue. And therefore, they also go on insulin. And so that's what we see in the claims data, but we can assert out of the claims data what's actually happening in the clinic. And I'm sure it's different for every patient. But at the population level, that's the very clear and striking dynamic. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Kratky with Leerink Partners. Brett Gasaway : This is Brett on for Mike. Just wanted to go back to the guide, I guess, on the high and the low end in particular. What are some of the assumptions in terms of just the G7 launch like? Does it take a certain time in the summer that that's going to launch to hit the high end of the guide or the midpoint of the guide? Or is there anything that we should be thinking about in terms of timing there? And then with that, just overall attrition and then the timing of the France launch as well, if there's any swing factors there in the OUS guide. Ana Chadwick : All right. There's a few questions here, and maybe we'll tag team here between Jim and I. Let me take the guide first. Listen, it goes back to the fundamental. First and foremost, we're increasing our revenue guide. Second point in terms of timing, we are absolutely assuming that as we put the new G7 pods into our channels, there's going to be a reduction of the G6 as it gets sold through the channel. So there is a destocking of that G6, and we have an assumption there, I'll call it, roughly in the $10 million or so. Now the timing of all of this is really hard to call. That's why as I get the question asked, I keep bringing everybody back up to the full year, the second half of the year. But that, I just wanted to clarify because it's been asked a few times, and that's really our underlying assumption. And I want to go back to your second question around international. Can you repeat that? James Hollingshead : France launch. Ana Chadwick : So I'll start. As we've said, the timing of the France launch will be here over the summer. And the teams are ready. They worked out all the pricing, and they're working all the sales force and everything. So we expect, as we mentioned, that every country is slightly different. In France, there tends to be more of this 4-year cycle of contract renewals as people might have been previously in pumps and so on. So we are assuming in our financials more of that uptick into the later half of the year, very -- like later into the year as it ramps and it takes time but really being a tailwind for us in 2025. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with TD Cowen. Joshua Jennings : I wanted to just ask on the pharmacy channel. And so it's enjoyed exclusivity sort of getting patient access through their pharmacy benefit. Our team doesn't think there's really much risk to the current model reimbursement levels that insulin is achieving or securing. But are there any theoretical risk as some of the tubed pump competitors start to open up that channel for patients and just thinking about either reimbursement levels or just the model overall in terms of pump reimbursement into the pharmacy channel? James Hollingshead : Thanks, Josh. Really, really good question, and it's something we could have a very complicated conversation about, right? But the very simple answer from our point of view is that what's unique about pharmacy access for Omnipod 5 is that the product fits the channel really, really well. And tubed pumps are durable equipment, and they don't fit the channel very well. So as anybody trying to enter the market and get into the pharmacy channel with some sort of durable equipment plus some consumable thing, it will be very difficult. From them to do it, they'll have to do with lots of workarounds. There's going to be reimbursement challenges. There's going to be scripting challenges and all kinds of things that we could have a much longer conversation about and never say never. We're very mindful of competition. We have a lot of respect for our competitors. But it's taken us several years to build out the scale and scope we have in pharmacy channel. And as we referred to in our prepared remarks, Omnipod 5 is available in retail pharmacy within 5 miles of 85% of the U.S. population. That is going to be very, very difficult for any of our durable pump competitors to replicate. And the overall model of Omnipod 5 with its very easy access, ease of use, ease of setup, get it in a box at the pharmacy where you get your insulin, that model just fits very, very well, and I think the durable pump model does not fit the channel well. Operator : Thank you all so much for your questions. This does conclude our Q&A section. And I would like to turn the conference back to Jim Hollingshead. James Hollingshead : Thanks, operator. In closing, we're off to a great start in 2024. We're transforming diabetes care globally with Omnipod 5, which now also includes our limited commercial launches with G7 in the U.S. and with G6 and Libre 2 Plus internationally. We've got a very strong market leadership position, the right product portfolio to address the needs of both the type 1 and the type 2 global markets and a clear and focused strategy to drive continued growth leveraging our significant competitive advantages. Looking ahead, the balance of the year is going to include a number of important milestones for us as we've been through on the call. We expect all of those milestones to help us drive new customer starts and margin expansion in the second half of this year and lay the foundation for significant long-term growth, all of that while continuing to deliver on our mission to simplify the lives of people with diabetes all over the world. I just want to thank the entire global Insulet team for your dedication and passion for our customers and for our mission. You're doing a great job, global Insulet team. Thank you very much. Thanks, everybody, for joining us today, and we look forward to updating you next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. And I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations. Deborah Gordon : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Insulet's second quarter 2024 earnings call. With me today are Jim Hollingshead, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ana Maria Chadwick, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Both a replay of this call and the press release discussing our second quarter results and 2024 guidance will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Also on our website is our supplemental earnings presentation. We encourage you to reference that document for a summary of key metrics and business updates. Before we begin, we remind you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such statements. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely adjusted EBITDA and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. These measures align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance from period-to-period, and we believe they are helpful for others as well. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis with the exception of revenue growth rates, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim. Jim Hollingshead : Thanks Deb. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. 2024 is shaping up to be another year of rapid growth, fueled by strong demand for Omnipod 5 and our accelerating pace of product innovation. Our financial results in Q2 demonstrate our strong execution and significant momentum across all of our markets, both in the U.S. and internationally, and we remain the clear industry leader in automated insulin delivery. The Insulet team is executing at a high level and with increasing velocity, delivering strong financial performance and advancing our strategic initiatives. These first half results reinforce our confidence in an even stronger second half, and another year of robust revenue growth and margin expansion as we continue to deliver on our mission to simplify and improve the lives of people with diabetes. Second quarter revenue exceeded our expectations across the board. In light of first half results and continued strong momentum, we increased full year guidance for revenue, gross margin, and operating margin. On today's call, I'll update you on three things; our Q2 results and the continuing strength of our competitive position in the market; execution against our 2024 objectives to expand the Omnipod 5 platform globally, and lastly, our ongoing success capturing the value of scale across our business. Starting with financial performance. In Q2, we achieved total Omnipod revenue growth of 26%, including U.S. growth of 27% and international growth of 24%. Omnipod 5 continues to disrupt the diabetes technology landscape. In the U.S., we maintained a strong momentum in new customer starts, achieving sequential growth in Q2, line with our expectations. Our strategy is to drive market expansion through our focus on bringing people out of multiple daily injections onto Omnipod therapy. As a result of that focus, we continue to rapidly increase our customer base, while remaining at the forefront of driving overall market expansion. Our growth in the quarter was driven by increasing new customer starts from MDI users in both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. At a market level, we are seeing an emerging dynamic in which customers who have adopted pump technology are switching manufacturers at a lower rate. As a result of that dynamic and our continuing market leadership in MDI, our new customer starts from competitive switches have become a smaller part of our business. However, we continue to be the net winner in competitive switching, winning more customers than we lose. During the quarter, roughly 85% of our US new customer starts came from people previously using MDI, consistent with the prior quarter, and we continue to take share from our competitors. Across both the Type 1 and Type 2 populations, we benefit from our competitive advantage in the pharmacy channel. The scale and scope we have built in this channel has significantly increased access and simplicity, which in turn helped to drive strong new customer starts and maintain very high customer retention. We're also working hard to continue to increase awareness among prescribers and this work is paying off. A growing number of health care practitioners are writing scripts for Omnipod within both the endocrinologists and primary care physician channels. Insulet is the clear leader in Type 1 and our Omnipod platform also remains the clear choice for people with Type 2. We are excited about the huge opportunity for us in Type 2, subject to FDA clearance for Omnipod 5 label expansion, which we hope to receive this year. I will provide more detail in a few moments. Omnipod 5 wins everywhere it goes. In Q2, we were pleased to again deliver international revenue and new customer starts growth ahead of our expectations. As a result of this success, we are significantly raising our international revenue outlook, this time by 600 basis points. We're rapidly approaching $0.5 billion in annual international revenue for 2024, and we're still in the early innings. The accelerated revenue we are achieving returns us to growth rates above 20% at the high end of our international outlook. We've been able to achieve these results with only 2 full country launches and two more just getting started, which signals to us significant runway for continued international growth as we expand access to Omnipod 5 in all of the markets we serve. Earlier this year, we promised that in 2024, we would deliver a cascade of innovation. And in Q2, we continued to do just that, launching multiple platform expansions. Following our successful US limited market release, we entered full release of Omnipod 5 with Dexcom's G7 in the last 2 weeks of the quarter. Full integration with both G6 and G7 allows us to offer even more choice for our customers and capture the growth and adoption of Dexcom's latest sensor. As a reminder, Omnipod 5 with G7 is now exclusively available through several specialty pharmacies. This has allowed us to deliver an outstanding customer experience and ensure that new customers receive their Omnipod 5 G7 starter packs and Pod seamlessly. Demand for our G7 offering is strong. Early results are promising and in line with our expectations. We have been pleased with the performance of this channel. It is operating at scale, and we can flex to meet ongoing increases in demand. And it allows us to focus our inventory on new customers in the near-term, which we continue to expect will provide us with a tailwind in new customer starts during the second half of the year. Last week, we provided our existing Omnipod 5 customers, a free over-the-air software update, enabling their controllers and compatible smartphones to pair with G7. Existing customers will be able to move to G7 once they see compatible Pods appear in their preferred retail pharmacy. Given the success of our specialty pharmacy launch, we recently made the decision to allow the inventory shift in retail outlets to progress at a more natural pace. This will allow us to minimize any potential confusion for our customers, and our channel partners, while also minimizing the risk of potential product returns and potential impact on our gross margins. We continue to expect the ease of resell pharmacy as usual, will provide an additional new customer starts tailwind as G7 Pods naturally become more widely available, now planned later in Q3. During Q2, we achieved another major milestone with the initial US launch of the Omnipod 5 iOS app with G6, and our limited market release is progressing very well. We are hearing from early users just how Pod liberating the system is. One Podder og shared that \"Omnipod 5, with the iPhone is the biggest innovation since the introduction of AID \u2013 it's a delightful experience having everything on one device.\" We also had a Podder tell us \"Omnipod 5, that's managing diabetes in the background .\" It is gratifying to hear this feedback and it gives us even more confidence in our ability to continue scaling our limited release and then transition to full release in the fall. Adding to this cascade of innovation in the US, we are pleased to announce that we expect to launch Omnipod 5 integrated with Abbott's Freestyle Libre 2 Plus sensor by the end of this year. We are excited to expand our Omnipod 5 offering to reach customers in the US, who have chosen the Libre family of sensors, and we are confident this portfolio expansion will generate increased demand for Omnipod 5, just as we are seeing in the early days of our launches with Libre 2 Plus internationally. Turning to international. In Q2, we extended the Omnipod 5 platform into new markets and we were the first to offer integration with Abbott's Libre 2 Plus sensor internationally, introducing this integrated offering in the UK and Netherlands. This also marked our first sensor of choice Pod offering, which is compatible with both Libre 2 Plus and G6. We are hearing from ACPs and patients that both integrations are providing an outstanding experience, including how easy it is to start Omnipod 5 using either leading sensor. Further expanding global reach, we recently launched Omnipod 5 in France, which is one of our largest markets. We are in the early days and feedback from patients and HCPs has been fantastic. HCPs have noted the very positive clinical outcomes with particular emphasis on Omnipod 5's simplicity. Demand for Omnipod has always been high in France. And with Omnipod 5, we expect to continue to build on this strength and successfully drive robust adoption as we have seen in our other international launch markets. Omnipod 5 is now available to the majority of our European customers. And of course, we are not stopping there. We are in the final planning stages for additional launches in Italy, the Nordics, Canada, Australia, Switzerland and Belgium, with others soon to follow. For all of the countries in our near-term pipeline, you will see us begin local market work to prepare for our planned commercial launches throughout 2025. We will keep you updated on our progress, capitalizing on the enormous international opportunity we are pursuing. Turning to type 2 diabetes, which represents another significant opportunity for growth in our business. We are already the market leader in our space. In the second quarter, people with type 2 represented roughly 25% of our US new customer starts, continuing a strong ongoing trend. The type 2 insulin delivery market is large and significantly underpenetrated. The combined patient population using either intensive insulin therapy or basal insulin is roughly three times the size of the type 1 population. This year, we have had two important pathways for innovation in the type 2 space, both commercial and clinical. As you know, we have been commercially piloting Omnipod GO, a product aimed at the needs of basal-only insulin users. The purpose of that pilot has been to accomplish two main goals : one, determine the optimal way to expand our sales force; and two, develop a better understanding of the patient profile that presents in nonspecialist practices so we can better serve patient needs. This pilot has led to our identifying multiple patient profiles and designing our go-to-market strategy. In parallel, we have been pursuing clinical work to expand our offerings for people with type 2 diabetes, most meaningfully with our pivotal trial with Omnipod 5 called SECURE-T2D. We recently presented the trial data at ADA, and I want to take a moment to summarize some of the key top line results. SECURE-T2D is the largest study ever completed for the use of automated insulin delivery in type 2 diabetes, with approximately 300 people completing the protocol. The study participants were highly diverse and representative of the general population in the US. This is important both from the point of view of HealthEquity and because the study results will be clinically relevant to patients as they present in the real world. The clinical outcomes were striking. Omnipod 5 delivered an average A1c reduction of 0.8 with increasing benefit across the study population as baseline A1cs were higher. Those with the baseline A1c greater than 9 on average achieved an A1c reduction of 2.1. More than half of the participants were concurrently on GLP-1 therapy. And notably, results were the same across all cohorts, whether or not on a GLP-1. Importantly, roughly 20% of study participants were currently on basal-only insulin injections, and they also benefited in line with intensive insulin users. In this population, a key barrier to insulin adoption is the risk of hypoglycemia. And in SECURE-T2D, there was no increase in hypoglycemia. Finally, among several other demonstrated benefits, study participants reported a clinically valid and meaningful reduction in diabetes distress. These remarkable results clearly demonstrate Omnipod 5's benefit for people with type 2 diabetes. On the basis of these results, in June, we filed for expansion of our indications use for Omnipod 5 with the FDA. Now that we have such strong results from our clinical trial work and the rich learnings from our Omnipod GO commercial pilot, these two innovation streams will come together. In anticipation of FDA clearance of our label expansion, during the coming quarters, we will make targeted investments in our sales force to extend our currently successful sales model and expand our feet on the street to further penetrate the Omnipod 5 prescribing base, and we will focus our efforts on Omnipod 5. We strongly believe Omnipod 5 will provide benefit to a wide range of insulin using type 2 patients, both those MDI and those on basal-only insane therapy. Therefore, Omnipod 5 will replace Omnipod GO as our offering for people with type 2 diabetes on basal-only insulin. We are grateful for the patients and the HCPs that participated in our pilot and we look forward to supporting them in their transition to other Omnipod therapies. Leading with Omnicon 5 in this space will enable us to serve more customers by leveraging and streamlining existing operations, supply chain and manufacturing, and it eliminates the need for ongoing investments in product life cycle management for a separate product platform. More importantly, we are confident we have a clear right to win in the type 2 space. We expect to be the first to market in type 2 with an AID offering, and not just any AID offering, but with Omnipod 5, which is the product platform that quickly leapfrogged into market leadership once we launched it in type 1. Omnipod 5 will bring all the benefits to type 2 patients that it already delivers, ease of access to the pharmacy channel, low to no upfront cost, market-leading ease of use and the unique discretion and convenience of a wearable, disposable patch pump with the day-to-day simplicity of full phone control with both Android and iOS. All of that, while delivering the striking clinical benefits we have just established with our pivotal trial. We are excited to bring the best automated insulin delivery offer to the type 2 market by the end of this year, pending clearance by the FDA. Ana will have more detail on the financial impact of our refined strategy in a few moments, but the biggest financial impact will be the opening of a new addressable market for us which we fully expect will fuel our growth. Before I hand over to Ana, I'd like to briefly discuss our expanded global manufacturing capabilities. We've been successfully investing in process innovation in our Insulet facility, which is meaningfully contributing to gross margin expansion. And we have made significant investment in the new state-of-the-art manufacturing plant in Malaysia, which will enable us to scale faster and expand margins and cash flow. We are thrilled to have begun producing sellable Omnipod 5 product in Q2 in Malaysia ahead of schedule. Our new facility is over two times the size of our US facility, and we expect it to be accretive to gross margin in its first full year of production, ramping as volumes increase. Our advantages and scale position us to grow our global business profitably and seamlessly meet the growing demand for Omnipod 5, which represents an important and distinct advantage over competitors. Shortly after this call, several members of our executive team will travel to Malaysia to attend our facilities official grand opening. We look forward to celebrating this occasion with our local team as well as the many other Insulet employees globally who helped to make this happen. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ana to walk you through our results and guidance. Ana Maria Chadwick : Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. We have significant momentum throughout our global business and elivered another strong quarter of financial results strategic execution. Most importantly, our global team continues to advance our mission to simplify and improve the lives of people with diabetes. Second quarter results exceeded our expectations. We achieved 23% revenue growth, driven by total Omnipod growth of 26%. Our estimated global retention remained stable. The foreign currency impact on total company revenue on a reported basis was approximately 80 basis points favorable versus our reported guidance. US Omnipod revenue growth was 27%, finishing above the high end of our guidance range. Omnipod 5 integrated with G6 is the primary driver of our strong growth, while our integration with G7 is gaining momentum. We are excited to have launched our US full market release with G7 in June, and we will continue to face into our channel partners over the coming months. I will speak more to this dynamic in a few moments. Our year-over-year US revenue growth was primarily driven by our success expanding our customer base and increasing volume throughout the pharmacy channel, including premium Omnipod. This was partially offset by an estimated $10 million reduction of inventory in the channel as we manage the Omnipod 5 G6 to G7 transition, which was in line with our expectations. US utilization trends were slightly lower than prior year as a result of Omnipod 5's significant ramp in the first full year of launch in 2023. As it relates to our US revenue expectations, we estimate approximately half of our beat versus the high end guidance was due to our strong commercial execution. The other half was due to pricing benefits from channel mix as well as fewer G6 pod returns than anticipated. Our underlying growth is strong. We have significant momentum, and we are thrilled to have expanded our product offering and provide greater choice for our customers. With our lead position in the market and the many catalysts for us this year, we are in a great position to continue to deliver robust revenue and customer base growth in 2024 and well beyond. Turning to international. We achieved international Omnipod revenue growth of 24%. These results were once again well above our expectations. While Omnipod DASH is doing very internationally and remains a sizable percentage of our overall international volume, Omnipod 5's demand is very high and fueling our growth. Last year's launch in the UK and Germany are driving both revenue and new customer start growth. Although early, the increased demand we're seeing in France as a result of our recent Omnipod 5 launch is very encouraging. Together with our with our rollout of Omnipod 5 Libre 2+ in two of markets around the start of 2Q, we are well positioned for continued growth. International utilization trends were slightly higher than in prior year due to higher initial Omnipod 5 orders, similar to what we saw last year in the US, but to a smaller degree. On a reported basis, foreign currency was 90 basis points headwind over the prior year and approximately 110 basis points favorable versus our guide. Drug delivery revenue was $8 million, which was above our guidance range, partially due to an increase in orders from our partner and timing of production. Gross margin was 67.7%, up 90 basis points, primarily driven by pricing benefits in both the US pharmacy channel and our international markets, as well as ongoing manufacturing efficiencies. Partially offsetting this growth was a onetime charge of $13.5 million, or 280 basis points relating to components that are not expected to be utilized. This charge resulted from our strategic decision to go market with Omnipod 5 instead of Omnipod GO to drive accelerated growth in type 2 pending FDA clearance. Even with this charge, our execution throughout our global business is resulting in significant margin expansion, which strengthens our confidence in our margin trajectory over the long-term as we continue to execute and scale efficiently. While operating expenses increased in the quarter as we invest in our business, including to support the cascade of innovations we've had this year and those to come, our level of spend was lower than we expected due to a timing shift into the second half of the year. In order to drive the above-market growth we have been delivering, we will continue to invest in our business. At the same time, we are achieving margin expansion resulting from our revenue performance, gross margin improvements and the operational leverage we are realizing throughout our business. Operating margin was 11.2% and adjusted EBITDA was 18.6% of revenue, both exceeding our expectations, primarily due to our revenue outperformance and the shift in timing of spend. Expansion of these metrics was partially offset by the onetime charge of $13.5 million or 280 basis points related to Omnipod GO. Last quarter, we provided color that due to our positive earnings trend, we may find at some point in the year that the valuation allowance we had against our deferred tax assets may no longer be required. In Q2, we reached this conclusion, and therefore, we released the majority of our valuation allowance, resulting in a non-cash tax benefit of approximately $150 million in the period, which we adjusted out for non-GAAP purposes. We expect another $30 million to be recognized during the remainder of the year. We now expect our 2024 effective tax rate, excluding the full $180 million to be in the range of 20% to 25%. Turning to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with approximately $820 million in cash and the full $300 million available under our credit facility. Last week, we successfully extended the maturity of our Term Loan B to August 2031 and repriced the loan at a lower interest rate, which will reduce cumulative interest expense over the term of the loan by approximately $17 million. Our commitment to drive profitable growth and positive free cash flow is paying off, resulting in our ability to expand margins and strengthen our overall financial profile. Now turning to our 2024 outlook. For the full year, we are once again raising our expectations for total Omnipod revenue growth to a range of 18% to 21%, representing a milestone of $2 billion in annual revenue at the high end of our range. As a result, we also are raising total company revenue growth to a range of 16% 19%. For US Omnipod, we're raising the low end of our revenue guidance and now expect a range of 18% to 21% growth. We expect growth be driven primarily by continued strong demand for Omnipod 5, including the benefits of the reoccurring revenue stream from our annuity model and growing customer base. As a reminder, we have a tougher comparison in the second half of 2024 versus the prior year period resulting from the estimated orders that were accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2023 from 2024. We continue to anticipate both revenue dollars and new customer starts in the second half of 2024 to be higher than levels in the first half. While we continue to expect sequential growth in new customer starts in both Q3 and Q4, our guidance now contemplates a less steep ramp of new customer starts in the second half of 2024, driven by both the overall market reduction in competitive switching that Jim referred to, and the slightly longer facing period of our G7 Pods through our retail channel partners. While the latter has a temporary impact on new customer starts during the second half, it is simply timing. We are confident this strategy will maximize the customer and HCP experience, which is our top priority, while having the added benefit of limiting returns of the G6 Pod in the channel. Our revenue guidance continues to assume a gradual restocking in the second half of this year as we expand our distribution of G7 Pods throughout all channel partners. For international Omnipod, we are raising our revenue growth expectations by 600 basis points to a range of 18% to 21%. On a reported basis, we now assume there will be no foreign currency impact. We anticipate revenue growth to be driven by the strong momentum from last year's Omnipod 5 launches in the UK and Germany, partially offset by headwinds in countries where we do not yet have Omnipod 5. Our 2024 outlook for international business is strengthened every day by the success we are achieving with Omnipod 5. Greater-than-expected new customer starts today, as well as revenue outperformance, has resulted in raising our international Omnipod outlook by 1,100 basis points since the start of 2024. Omnipod 5 is gaining traction and taking share. Feedback has been tremendous, and we are clearly a leader with our advanced technology. While we expect our most recent Omnipod 5 launches to contribute new customer starts in the second half of this year, given the nature of our annuity model, we expect them to contribute even more meaningfully to revenue in 2025. Our incredible momentum internationally strengthens our confidence that Omnipod 5 will drive further growth and share gain in every market in which we launch. For both US and International Omnipod, our guidance factors in quarterly revenue fluctuations resulting from the many product launches we have in 2024. This includes ramping inventory in the channel for new launches and reducing levels of prior Omnipod generations. Lastly, for drug delivered, our outlook has improved and we now expect a decline in the range of 40% to 50%, reflecting our partner's revised forecast. Turning to 2024 gross margin. Given our strong margin performance in the first half of 2024 and the retirement of some risks we had modeled related to our product launches and new manufacturing facility, we have greater confidence in our full year 2024 outlook. As a result, we now expect to land closer to the high end of our 68% to 69% range, even with the 70 basis points annualized impact from the second quarter Omnipod GO charge. We are in a tremendous position to drive further gross margin expansion over the near and long term, and we remain committed to executing our strategy to deliver this growth. We remain committed to driving operating margin expansion as we capitalize on our efficiencies and economies of scale. Even as we continue to heavily invest in commercial, clinical and R&D to fuel our strong revenue growth trajectory. As a result, we are once again raising operating margin guidance another 50 basis points to approximately 14%. Turning to our third quarter guidance. We expect total Omnipod growth of 21% to 24% and total company growth of 18% to 21%. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect growth of 21% to 24%, primarily driven by strong demand for Omnipod 5, stronger customer starts and the benefit of our immunity model. For International Omnipod, we expect growth of 21% to 24%, driven by ongoing adoption of Omnipod 5, partially offset by headwinds in countries where we do not yet have Omnipod 5. On a reported basis, we now assume an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 100 basis points. Finally, we expect Q3 drug delivery revenue to be approximately $3 million to $4 million. In conclusion, our global Insulet team continues to execute and drive strong results. We generated robust new customer starts globally and our cascade of innovation strengthens our position to deliver sustained revenue growth and margin expansion this year and beyond. With that, operator, please open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Robbie Marcus : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on a really nice quarter. I want to ask some clarifying questions here. I'll just get them all in. First, gross margin would have been something closer to 70.5% operating margin and EBITDA would have been materially higher without the onetime charge to write down the inventory. I guess, what was the reason to leave it in and not back it out? I think most companies would have backed it out. And then second, I think there's just a little confusion on the commentary around the new patient ramp in the second half. Maybe you could just add a little clarifying commentary to that? Is it less new patients? Is it related to type 2 specifically? Is it competitive switches? Just make it crystal clear the view and can you grow new patients year-over-year. Thanks a lot. A \u2013 Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Robbie. It's great to have you on the call. Thanks for your question, and thanks for your congrats. I'll start on the new customer start question, and then I'll hand back to Ana to talk about the margin and the onetime charge. So a new customer starts we're trying to describe what we see in the market really, really clearly. And the first thing is had good sequential increase in new customer starts, which was our goal and we hit along those guides. What we're seeing in the market, we're trying to characterize the trend we've seen in the market. So we were up in MDI in both type 1 and type 2. And looking to the quarter, what we see is a dynamic where just in installed base and market-wide, competitive switching for patients already in the installed base is down. And there was some question as we've looked at the data, to what extent that was seasonality over the last couple of quarters. But I think looking back, we can see that it's just clear that the total pool of competitive switchers is just down. And one of the reasons for that, course, is that over the last several quarters, we've grown our percentage of the installed base really substantially. So there are a lot of Omnipod users out there, mostly Omnipod 5 users out there that are not targets for us to switch. But it's part of the market that -- it's a smaller part of the market overall, and it's a smaller part of what's going on in the market. The important thing that we're trying to convey is that, for us, the play is MDI. So if you think about it, somewhere between 8 or 9 out of 10 of our new customer starts are coming from MDI and only about one new customer start comes out of competitive switching for us. And so that's very, very clear. That's our strategy. That's what we're trying to do. Omnipod 5 is so appealing. We're the player that's growing the market, and we're clearly leading and we continue to clearly lead in MDI. Having said that, we also continued to win in the competitive switching game. We win more customers than we lose. But we're trying to characterize for all of you what see happening as an overall trend in the market. Our play will continue to be to grow the market because Omnipod 5 allows us to bring more patients in, and we clearly lead in that, very consistent with our overall strategy. Ana, do you want to pick up on the margin question? A \u2013 Ana Maria Chadwick : Sure. So absolutely, thank you, Jim, for that. Background here is we do not adjust for operational items. But what we tried to do during the script and in our earnings press release, we give you all the puts and takes of the 280 basis points that flows through from gross margin to up margin for the quarter and for the full year, the 70 basis points. So you can see we're adjusting that one-timer, we're executing incredibly well. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Baird. Your line is open. Q \u2013 Jeff Johnson : Thank you. Jim, maybe I can ask one clarifying question on your new starts and I do have one of the questions that implied fourth quarter guidance. But on the new starts, I think I heard you saying that your new starts were up sequentially, I just want to confirm that and make sure that the US, global or what number is that? And is that everything combined, kind of the MDI plus competitive convert, you put it on a lot of new starts overall to the company. We're up either US or globally and then like I said, I have one question on the fourth quarter. A \u2013 Jim Hollingshead : Yeah. So yeah, so Jeff, thank you for the question. New starts were up, both in the US sequentially and internationally sequentially. Just to be clear. Jeff Johnson : Okay, that's helpful. And then just on the implied fourth quarter guidance, either for Ana or for you, Jim. When I look at the U.S. Omnipod guidance, depending on what I pick is the midpoint or the point -- I decided to in 3Q within your guidance, the implied kind of the fourth quarter U.S. Omnipod growth probably where from low single-digits to low double-digits, the bigger range there because we're taking a point estimate in 3Q. You obviously had anywhere from 6 to 9 points depending on how much we count the pull forward into 4Q 2023 last year, that's kind of a year-over-year headwind. When I put all that in the hopper, it seems like you're kind of talking about fourth quarter U.S. Omnipod growth in the low to mid-teens. One, is that a reasonable way to think about how you're thinking about adjusted U.S. Omnipod growth? And is that where we should be thinking about as kind of a stepping off point for 2025? Or is there other things in 2025, like type 2 in that, that can maybe take you above that low to mid-teens U.S. Omnipod growth? Thank you. Ana Maria Chadwick : Jeff, I'll start with that. Thanks for the question. You are absolutely correct. There are absolutely a lot of puts and takes, especially in the fourth quarter. The important thing to recall here is that our overall guidance for the year continues to be strong, and I know you're referring here specific to the U.S. with that high end of our guidance at that 21%. So, we raised the volume at 18% up to the 21%. I do want to mention something as we think of 2025, which we are not providing guidance during this call. We'll wait until we wrap-up the fourth quarter. We have a lot of things transpiring here, as Jim mentioned in the second half of the year. G7, we have iOS. We have Libre 2 Plus. We have the international that it's really ramping incredibly nicely and more countries ahead and we have the type 2 label extension. Once we have more clarity into the later part of the year, we'll come back and provide that additional guidance. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Larry Biegelsen : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Hey Jim, one clarification on new starts for me. Did you say overall U.S. starts -- new starts to be up in Q3 and Q4? Jim Hollingshead : Yes. So, Larry, I know we're actually going to get a lot of clarifying questions on this. I'll just -- let me see if I can characterize it clearly. I'll give it another try. So, we expect sequential growth in the U.S. in new customer starts in Q3 and then again in Q4. And that's consistent with what we've said over the course of the last two quarters, where we expect the second half to be stronger and sequentially stronger two, three, four -- Q2, Q3, Q4 over the course of the year. And the ramp characteristics remain the same. The big tailwind driver for us is G7 and then we have other tailwinds coming. I think that one question that I'm sure people are asking themselves is what does that mean in terms of where we land. And there's two things that have changed in the quarter. One is, as I said, there's a smaller portion of the market overall is competitive switching, although we continue to win clearly in competitive switching. And the other thing is, as we said in the prepared comments, is our G7 launch is going very well through the specialty pharmacy channel and the ramp is good. Demand is good. We're servicing it really well. But we made the decision because of that to not disrupt the customer experience and the channel experience to let inventory flow more naturally into that channel. And so both of those things create a little bit -- I would say, a little bit of a change in our outlook on total new customer starts in the second half. And so as Ana characterized in her comments, we expect a steep ramp, but the ramp in the second half is probably a little bit less steep than we had been expecting before. Now where that lands in terms of total year new customer starts, is hard to characterize each of those -- each of those two dynamics are kind of hard to quantify neither of them is that big. But combined, what we're expecting is a less steep ramp in the second half, but still a really good ramp in the second half in new customer starts in the U.S. Larry Biegelsen : Okay. So Jim thanks. And so margins, that's what I wanted to ask about. If I take out the onetime charge in the second quarter, your gross margin in the first half, I think, was about 70%. The implied -- even with keeping the one-time charge in, it's about 68.5%. So why the lower -- lower gross margin in the second half versus the underlying first half? And how should we think about the benefit to your gross margin from Malaysia beyond 2024? Thanks. Ana Maria Chadwick : Yes. Let me jump into that. So in the first quarter, we had gross margin of 69.5%, and now we have 67.7%. So that gets us shy of the 69%. And in the second half, we expect to be, as you can imagine, we're guiding to the full 69%. So that's going to be higher than the 69% to make the overall. So that guidance, I just want to be clear, contemplates that contemplates that 70 -- for the full year 70 basis points of pressure, we did not back that out from our guidance. We kept the Omnipod GO charge that we took this quarter in our guidance. So hopefully, helps answer the question. Malaysia has a more limited impact. So as it's starting to produce product. And we expect to get more of that benefit, as we move into 2025 and the first full year of running operations. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Margaret Kaczor with William Blair. Your line is opens. Margaret Kaczor : Hi. Good afternoon, folks. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess one on International and one in the U.S., and apologies for having both in here. But internationally, obviously, you're seeing a tremendous amount of traction. So can you give us some sense around how much of the beaten guidance range this quarter is related to new patient adds in these two countries, the two new countries that you are in? Are seeing kind of this change in MDI starts just in general, where you can start to say, hey, this is a market trend. This isn't just, hey, we're taking competitive switches or more new patient adds, which I'm sure is part of it. But just trying to get a sense of what's going on, on the ground? And is it happening similar as we saw in the U.S. a few years ago. And then just on the U.S. side and this is a clarification question that may be helpful may not. But the change in competitive converts, historically, 20% of new patient adds or competitive converts. Now you're saying it's 15%. So the delta seems pretty minor 5% but correct me if I'm wrong on that. Thank you. Jim Hollingshead : Yeah. Thanks, Margaret. I'll take both of those. On international, we're so pleased with Omnipod 5 internationally. It clearly wins wherever we're able to take it. The U.K. launch continues to go extremely well. The Germany launch is going extremely well and off a very strong performance in previous quarters, we -- both of those countries continue to perform ahead of expectation. We've just launched in France. It's very early. France is a really big market for us, but we know we have big demand, and we're rolling that out. We have patients on product and that's beginning to ramp. And then the other launch is, of course, the Netherlands. And -- when we launched the Netherlands, that was our first -- when we entered that country, entered it with our sensor of choice offering, which is G6 and Libre 2, and we took that center of choice offering into the UK, where we were already on market with G6, and that offering is going great. So these are largely MDI growth, driven growth phenomenon in all of those countries. As you know, internationally, most people who are on technology are locked into their contracts. And so it's largely MDI new-to-market customers. Many of them are already on a CGM because CGM paves a road for us, but they're largely new to market pumpers, and we're really, really pleased with the performance, and it makes us very bullish as we continue to roll out Omnipod 5 internationally. On the US dynamic, yes, I mean we're trying to characterize it. It's a little bit odd. We know there's lots of questions about what's going on out there. But you're right, the mix shift is -- that kind of percentage mix shift. That's consistent with what we had last quarter, 85-15. But as we look at the market, what we see as a trend now where just total base of competitive switching out there is smaller. It's a smaller part of the market. It's never been our focus in the business. It's not our focus. Now our focus is market growth. But that 85-15 split is actually not that big a deal. We just want to characterize the dynamic. MDI, we were up in MDI type 1 in the US., up in MDI in type 2, and we very clearly lead in MDI. Although we also win in competitive switching, that's a smaller part of our market and a lower emphasis for us strategically. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Travis Steed with Bank of America. Your line is open. Travis Steed : Hey, I wanted to clarify a couple of things from the earlier questions. So Jim, did you say new starts can grow year-over-year in the second half of the year? And also I wanted to clarify, you were commenting on demand is good, but you made a decision to disrupt the customer experience and let inventory grow naturally. So that creates a [indiscernible] in the outlook in the second half? So I really wanted to understand kind of what you make... Jim Hollingshead : Travis, It's -- I hope I didn't say it that way. I meant the exact opposite of what you just said, which is we don't want to disrupt customer experience. So what's going on with the specialty pharmacy launch, we've used that kind of specialty pharmacy approach a couple of times in the past, especially as we entered pharmacy. We've actually upgraded the way do it, so with this launch. And with -- this is the first time that we've brought kind of a new compatibility to the Pod into the same channel under the same reimbursement code. And so figuring out how to feather that in and focus our built inventory on new customers has been what we've been designing to do. And we decided to take that into pharma -- into the specialty pharmacies because it allows us to focus on new starts rather than driving a lot of conversion in the base, which doesn't grow our customer base, right? So by taking it through specialty pharmacy, we're focusing on growing our new customer base, which is really important to the business and brings new customers into the market. And as we did that, it wasn't fair to us as we planned it because it was the first time what dynamic would be. The dynamic is great. We're actually really well able to service very strong demand for G7 through specialty pharmacies. And saying that, I should also point out, those specialty pharmacies, the most of them were through multiple pharmacies there through kind of a hub service that we've set up. And most of them are not visible to third-party data. So if people are out there trying to watch our new customer starts, they won't be able to see most of our G7 starts through other reporting mechanisms, for example, like IQVIA. So demand is really good, and it's flowing so well and we can flex it. And so that customer experience has been great. Therefore, we've decided not to force inventory into the retail channel, which would be potentially disruptive both for our channel partners and for customers. So we're going through specialty pharmacy. It's going very well, and we're going to let the inventory transition in retail at a more natural pace. So that's why it's really because of a new customer -- we want to deliver the strongest possible customer experience, and we're happy with how specialty pharmacy is going. So that's on that question. On the first part of your question, year-over-year growth, I think we expect during the second half to cross over into year-over-year growth, it's hard to call exactly when that happens. But the expectation is yes, we get year-over-year growth in the second half. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Michael Polark with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Michael Polark : Thank you. Okay. I'll ask a follow-up on the Type 2 update. The decision to prioritize 05 over go, I'm interested -- is your expectation that that the SECURE-T2D label or data will allow you to market both the MDI and basal-only population? That's one question. And then the second piece is pricing? Would you expect kind of patient-agnostic pricing for this product? And the third is -- I heard about the investments in the back half to set the stage for the Type 2 launch next year. Any way to frame how much you expect to expand head count through this process? Thank you so much. Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Mike. Thanks for the question. The first thing is, yes, I don't want to get too far in front of the FDA on the actual label, but the label we anticipate would allow us to market to both intensive insulin and basal insulin users. So that's the aim. And SECURE-T2D backs that up because 20% of the participants in SECURE-T2D were basal-only users, and they have fantastic results. And so the goal of Omnipod 5 is to get out there and help people who are on insulin who need better control because of the fantastic smart adjust algorithm and its ability to -- as you know, we adjust both basal and adjust for real-time bolus. And so that's the goal. And therefore, if we're able to achieve that labeling, we can help basal-only patients with Omnipod 5. And I know that know that you the initial plan was to start people on Omnipod GO and then as their insulin needs change get them on to Omnipod 5. And the beauty of this strategy is that we don't have to wait to have people going to Omnipod 5. Contingent on FDA labeling, which we expect, and I don't want to get in front of it and all those caveats, we think we can just -- we don't have to wait for Omnipod 5, we just take it to market as Omnipod 5 and meet the needs of a very wide range of patients than we were going to be able to meet. So we're excited about that. And Ana forgotten already the second part of your question. So... Ana Maria Chadwick : No, I just wanted to add maybe a comment there. When you think of the implications of that decision, it's not just a short-term impact that we just talked about. There is a much longer-term impact. Jim commented on the customer, commercial, all those things that there's also an operational impact in the company with less product life cycles, simpler in terms of our manufacturing capacity and operational and all those things that come along with that. It's going to have its fruits much longer into the 2025. Jim Hollingshead : Yes, we're really excited about being able to go on to the Omnipod 5 platform as the flagship offer there. I remember your other two components, Mike, so quickly on pricing. We don't anticipate -- I mean, Omnipod 5 is already well covered, well reimbursed for people with Type 2 diabetes. There's -- right now, there's no distinction, and we don't expect big commercial changes on that front. We'll see what happens, but we don't expect any disruption. And then on the other side of that, with the sales force, we've been successfully adding sales force heads now for some time. We added some earlier in the year. We'll continue to add sales force. We'll have more to say about the scale of that and the model for that as we get closer to actual launch. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Jefferies. Your line is open. Matt Taylor : Hi, thank you for the question. Maybe I could just further get some color and help clarify a couple key things we've been talking about on the call. One is I did want to ask you about -- you mentioned channel mix benefits in this quarter. And I'm wondering if you could talk about the source of those? And I guess just the outlook for that in the US and as a company, as you have a lot of shipping sand in terms of the different channels and how the mix could evolve? Ana Maria Chadwick : Sure. I'll start with that one. So when you think of the US, and we are very heavily penetrated now in the pharmacy channel, what we have is we ship product and then we have, of course, the wholesalers, the distributors and the PBMs, and at the end, it's the end customers. So how it moves into, which specific distributors with what relationships, and which PBMs with what coverage. That all is hard to call. And now what we're talking about is not huge dollars, what I described in terms of the impact, but we should have some fluctuation in our pricing as we go through that process. So we will continue to refine our models and just continue to get better and better around that. But it's really a simple dynamic of being now so heavy into the pharmacy channel. Operator : And your next question comes from Chris Pasquale with Nephron. Your line is open. Chris Pasquale : Thanks. I had one on International and one on the GO decision. On OUS, by our math, your International installed base share is well-below where you are in the US. I'm curious though, when we look at that overall international market, what percentage of those patients are in geographies where you have a presence today? In other words, how much of that pie are you really able to compete for? Jim Hollingshead : Yeah. Thanks, Chris. Internationally, as you know, we're only in 24 markets OUS. And the larger markets are obviously the usual suspects of large markets, UK, Germany, France, Nordics. And so we're in the U. with Omnipod 5 now in Germany with full releases and growing really, really well. France, we're just out of the gate with the Omnipod 5 launch in France. And then as we said in the prepared remarks, Nordics is on the list for coming launches. And then -- and you can -- just by population, I think all the medtech markets are fairly similar in terms of total opportunity. So we feel really good about where we are with Omnipod 5. It's clearly winning where we take it. And as we roll it out, we're very bullish on growth, which is what led us to another 600 basis point increase in guide. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Mike Kratky with Leerink Partners. Your line is open. Mike Kratky : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking our questions. Maybe just a couple on the type 2 launch. First of all, is your plan to implement a full commercial launch in type 2 once you get approval? Or could that be a more sequence launch? And then maybe just a quick one on the basal-only population, but based on the updates today, can you provide some color on the level of demand that you saw for pumps in the basal-only population? And does that change your outlook at all as you think about Omnipod 5? Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Mike. In terms of full commercial launch, I mean, what we've done is we've choreographed our plan for the launch in line with what we expect in terms of FDA approval. And so -- we expect FDA approval by the end of the year. And once we have that and with all the other pieces in place in terms of things like sales force training so on, we'll be able to promote in line with that. But we also anticipate, as I said, we'll say more -- we'll give more detail as we get closer to that. We anticipate also expanding our sales reach into nonspecialty channels by adding some feet on the street. And that just gives us more share voice into those markets. And so we'll have more to say about that later. But we do anticipate being able promote as we get clearance. The second side of your question around basal -- thank you. With basal, Omnipod GO product, we were out there looking at how do patients present in the channel. And we saw a number of patient profiles. So we went in with draft patient profile that I won't try to detail. We then -- we added a patient profile to that. And what we found was that there are a lot of patients in the non-specialty channel. There's different patient profiles with type 2 diabetes that need insulin, and there's also a lot of type 1 patients in there. So we're very confident that there's a lot of patients that -- whose needs we can address with Omnipod 5. And if anything, I would say, focusing on to Omnipod 5 makes us even more bullish about our ability to penetrate that market. So we learned a lot as we are in those practices about what's happening in there and which kinds of patients are in there. And we're really excited about taking Omnipod 5 as the flagship product for the patient journey into those channels and to reach those patients. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Your line is open Q \u2013 Jayson Bedford : Hi, good afternoon. I've got 15 clarifying questions. I'm just kidding. Just -- just quickly couple of type 2s. Are you seeing any benefit from the type 2 data that you presented at ADA in late June? And then second, you seem more confident in the timing of type 2 approval for Omnipod 5. Just to be clear, you're confident that reimbursement is in place. There's not going to be a lag in adoption because of reimbursement? Thanks. Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Jason, and thanks for the non 15 question list. So that -- so on type 2, yes, we're very confident. I mean, type 2 -- Omnipod 5 right now is reimbursed through the pharmacy benefit. There's not a request for which type of diabetes. It's a script that's written for Omnipod 5, and it's very well covered on that basis, and that's why physicians are writing off label for it. We did see an increase in MDI starts for type 2 patients in the quarter. We don't call out whether that's Omnipod DASH, which has the full indication for user, Omnipod 5. We did see some lift in MDI for type 2. We are not promoting Omnipod 5 for type 2 diabetes because we do yet have the indication for use expansion that will allow us to do that. And our reps, as I've said before, have one arm tied behind their back for that. So we're really bullish on that. But we have seen some lift. And we think the coverage should be final. There shouldn't be any delay in coverage for Omnipod 5 in type 2. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Q \u2013 Matthew O'Brien: Thanks for taking the question. I'm so sorry, I do have a clarifying one. What's this inventory tailwind you should be getting in the second half of year? I'd love to know about that. And then my main question is really on the MDI side. If I look at the results for you guys for a couple of your competitors, it looks like the MDI penetration rates are starting to accelerate, first of all, is that true? Secondly, what's driving it? Is it new technologies? And just how durable is it between type 1 and type 2s just given how important it's going to be for you guys going forward as you grow your business? Thanks. Ana Maria Chadwick : Thanks, Matt. So I'll start with your comment on inventory tailwinds. So as we talked about last quarter, we were anticipating a destocking of about $10 million, which we saw happened during the second quarter. And what we anticipate is during the second half of the year that should come back. And the reason it is all around the G6, G7 transition and how we're managing the channel through that process. Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Matt. On the MDI question. I won't try to probably together any of our competitors' results. I'll just say that I think it's reasonable to think that MDI penetration in type 1 is accelerating, and we're clearly leading that. So Omnipod 5 is very highly preferred with MDI patients. We continue to grow that space and we continue to win with MDI conversions. I think it's durable for both type 1 and type 2. And the reason I believe that is because the burden of living with diabetes remains very high and because our CGM partners have been out paving road very effectively in front of us for some time. And so, we've said before that we think penetration for AID in the type 1 space can go very high, well above 70% on the back of the pave road from CGM, and we're confident that we're going to be the leader that drives that kind of penetration. And we believe that now you see a lot of adoption in type 2 space with CGMs on an ongoing basis. And so our two partners, Abbott and Dexcom, are out there paving road for us in type 2, and we see a big opportunity to take Omnipod 5 likely as the first-to-market AID system in that space, you see a big opportunity to drive the penetration of Omnipod 5 and type 2 as well. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Steve Lichtman with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Steven Lichtman : Thank you. Good evening, everyone. On the international strength you were seeing versus you're thinking heading into the year, are you seeing better reimbursement and pricing in addition to faster new patient growth? Or is it is it -- all better volume? And can you remind us when you could have a G7 connectivity internationally? Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Steve. Yes. So what we've done, and we've referred to this in the past, as we launch Omnipod 5, we work really hard to make sure that our reimbursement is commensurate with the additional value that Omnipod 5 creates for the health care system and for patients. And so we've been able to, so far, so good, successfully negotiate a premium for Omnipod 5, where we've launched it. And so it is both volume and a bit of a price benefit. And -- but volumes are very, very good, obviously, with -- the starts are very, very strong for us with Omnipod 5 where we've taken it. And then again, I'm forgetting the second half of the... Ana Maria Chadwick : The G7 International. Jim Hollingshead : G7, we haven't announced timing. So we're obviously working on it. We have a very effective working G7 integration, which is creating a big tailwind for us in the US, we'll get it into European markets as soon as we can, but we have not yet announced timing. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with Citibank. Your line is open. Joanne Wuensch : Good evening. Thanks for taking the question and very nice quarter. Yesterday, there was an announcement that I think took a lot of people by surprise, the agreement between Medtronic and Abbott. I would love your opinion on how this changes or doesn't change the AID, and really diabetes delivery landscape. Thanks. Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Joanne. Yes, we're very happy with our two CGM partners. We have a great relationship with Abbott. We have a great relationship with Dexcom. We're working really well with both of them. We're very excited to announce that we'll be bringing the Libre 2+ integration to the US market by the end of the year. And for us, we have a clear road map for Omnipod 5 platform expansion that includes sensor expansions, and it's full speed ahead. We remain very confident in our competitive position. Omnipod 5 is extremely differentiated from two pumps and will continue to be. And so we're very bullish full speed ahead with both of our partners. Operator : And we have time for one last question. That will be from Bill Plovanic with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. Bill Plovanic : Hey. Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a good quarter. In terms of the gross margin, from shifting over to Malaysia, how much gross margin longer-term benefits should we see from that? And then how much do you pick up by eliminating GO, which potentially was probably a lower gross profit product, I would assume. Just kind of curious what that does for the longer-term GMs. Thanks for taking my questions. Ana Maria Chadwick : Great. Let me get started on that. So as we commented, we have really strong gross margin once you back out the impact -- the one-time impact of GO. We have stated before and continue to state Malaysia strategic for us. In the first 12 years, we will be accretive. So at the moment, we're ramping, so that will take time. So you can expect that, that will be accretive right at around that one-year mark and will continue to be. And the other point being the product life cycle. So by taking manufacturing time away from shifting lines and all of those things, we'll anticipate that. We're not providing long-term guidance here. So we'll come back and provide more color after we wrap up here in 2024. I do want to take the opportunity to come back to some of the early questions on new customer starts and clarify just to make sure everybody is on the same page. So new on customer starts, we expect sequential growth, second quarter to third quarter, third quarter to fourth quarter that to be true, US, international, of course, globally. And we already talked about all the reasons why that would happen. The question came up around year-over-year. And I want to also reiterate not only globally because it's obvious that international is working so well, but to a lesser extent, but it's there. Our guidance contemplates year-over-year growth in US NCS. So I just wanted to make sure that that was clarified for everyone. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer section. I would now like to turn the conference back to Mr. Jim Hollingshead for closing remarks. Jim Hollingshead : Thank you, operator. In closing, we're very pleased with our Q2 and excited about our coming second half. Our cascade of innovation continues with our G7 tailwind, iOS and Libre 2 coming to the US and we're eagerly anticipating TAM expansion with FDA clearance for Omnipod 5 and type 2. Our international business continues to outperform on the strength of Omnipod 5. All of that led us to raise our guide across the board. And none of that would be possible without our amazing global Insulet team who get up every morning to change the lives of people living with diabetes. Thank you, global team. And thanks for joining us, everybody, today. We look forward to updating you next quarter. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference, and we thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day, and you may all disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations. Deborah Gordon : Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Insulet's third quarter 2024 earnings call. With me today are Jim Hollingshead, President and Chief Executive Officer; Ana Maria Chadwick, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Both the replay of this call and the press release discussing our third quarter results and 2024 guidance will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Also on our website is our supplemental earnings presentation. We encourage you to reference that document for a summary of key metrics and business updates. Before we begin, we remind you that certain statements made by Insulet during the course of this call may be forward-looking and could materially differ from current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statements in our SEC filings for a detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such statements. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, namely adjusted EBITDA and constant currency revenue, which is revenue growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. These measures align with what management uses as supplemental measures in assessing our operating performance from period to period, and we believe they are helpful for others as well. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis, with the exception of revenue growth rates, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim. Jim Hollingshead : Thank you, Deb. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We delivered another strong quarter of financial results and achieved several outstanding milestones throughout our business. I am proud of what our team accomplishes every day to create better health outcomes for our customers, set new standards in the management of diabetes and drive success across our organization. The robust momentum we saw in the first half of this year has carried into the back half, putting us on track to close out another impressive year and generate over $2 billion in full year revenue for the first time in Insulet's history. Near the end of August, we received FDA clearance for type 2 label expansion for Omnipod 5, which is a testament to the strength of our submission and powerful clinical data. We are excited about our opportunity in the type 2 diabetes market and building upon our strong established foundation for long-term growth. In the third quarter, our global new customer starts grew sequentially and over prior year. This included sequential growth in the U.S. in both the type 1 and type 2 populations. Internationally, our strong momentum also continued with stable sequential new customer starts, proof of the robust demand we are seeing for Omnipod 5, considering the typical seasonality that occurs during the slower summer months in our international markets. Omnipod 5 is winning in every market in which it is offered, and Omnipod is now the #1 insulin pump for new pump users in Europe. We remain confident in our expectation of sequential and year-over-year new customer starts growth for both the U.S. and International in the fourth quarter. We have a clear strategy focused on expanding the Omnipod 5 platform, driving growth in the U.S. in both type 1 and the type 2 and accelerating international growth and expansion. Our recent milestones are key indicators of the progress we continue to make and the momentum across our organization to achieve our strategic goals. And this momentum is reflected in our strong financial results. In Q3, we achieved our highest quarter of total revenue dollars, driven by total Omnipod revenue growth of 26%, including U.S. growth of 23% and International growth of 35%. And we continue to expand margins as we scale, execute and drive efficiencies across our global business. Ana will take you through the financial details for the quarter and provide an update on guidance. I will focus my remarks on three key areas : first, our type 2 label expansion, the market opportunity and our commercialization plans; second, our cascade of innovation and how it supports our strategy to drive growth in both the U.S. and internationally; and third, our customer base and market leadership. Let me start with our recent type 2 label expansion, which makes Omnipod 5 the first and only AID system indicated for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Omnipod 5 continues to be the game-changing offer we thought it would be. And now we are bringing all the benefits to individuals with type 2 diabetes that we already deliver to those with type 1, namely: unmatched form factor, ease of use, affordability, pay-as-you-go economics and widespread access through the pharmacy channel. All of this, together with CGM integration and compatibility with Android- and iOS-based smartphones and, most importantly, all while delivering great clinical outcomes and quality of life. Omnipod 5's type 2 label expansion further strengthens our growth trajectory. In fact, type 2 users represented over 25% of our U.S. new customer starts in the third quarter as we drove ramping adoption during September. In the U.S., our type 2 indication significantly expands the total addressable market for Insulet by making Omnipod 5 commercially available to approximately 6 million people who live with insulin-requiring type 2 diabetes. This market includes 2.5 million people who are insulin intensive and on multiple daily injections. We estimate that market is less than 5% penetrated, with the majority of current users using Omnipod. The other portion of the market includes over 3 million people that use insulin as a basal-only therapy every day. In order to continue expanding our reach to type 2 patients, we are well underway on an initiative to expand our sales force and commercial relationships to align with the immense opportunity at hand. We have begun the process of growing our team in anticipation of type 2 clearance earlier this year, and we continue to expand today. This strategy is consistent with our established U.S. commercial playbook, adding feet on the street to build on our existing relationships with endocrinology practices while also broadening our reach into high-prescribing PCP practices. With this expansion, we expect to reach over 40% of the 2.5 million type 2 insulin-intensive population during 2025. And we will also be able to go deeper into PCP practices, where we are already receiving great inbound interest. Additionally, we continue to complement our direct selling model with DTC. We expect our type 2 label expansion will make our DTC efforts and awareness initiatives even more efficient. Historically, over 50% of our DTC leads are from individuals with type 2 diabetes, and now we can get those customers quickly onto Omnipod 5. We are making all of these investments thoughtfully. And as our Q3 results demonstrate, we are committed to driving further margin expansion. Let me now discuss our cascade of innovation and how we continue to strengthen our market-leading position as we expand our Omnipod 5 platform. Last quarter, we announced the full market release of Omnipod 5 with Dexcom's G7 in the U.S., starting with specialty pharmacies, and communicated that we would ramp G7-compatible pods broadly through retail pharmacy channels over the following months. This approach has proven to be very effective, and G7 customer starts have consistently met our targets. I'm happy to announce that G7 pods are now fully available in retail pharmacies, in addition to customers also having the choice of specialty pharmacy, making it even easier to start on Omnipod 5. Adding to this cascade of innovation in the U.S., we are on track to launch Omnipod 5 integrated with Abbott's FreeStyle Libre 2 Plus sensor by the end of the year. We are excited to provide customers' expanding options as we have experienced great success in providing [indiscernible] with the Choice of Sensors in the U.K. and the Netherlands with both Abbott and Dexcom CGM offerings. At the start of last week, we fully launched the Omnipod 5 iOS app in the U.S., in line with our planned timing. Within hours of our app launch, we became the top downloaded medical app in the iOS App Store. Integrated with G6, our app offers enhanced capabilities that are unique and huge timesavers for Podders, such as a custom foods feature that makes mealtime simpler. Early feedback has been extremely positive. We heard from one of our customers who told us, \"Being able to do daily activities and need to carry only my personal smartphone is the smallest piece of normalcy and the biggest relief. I'm sitting here crying just overwhelmed with how much that means. I haven't felt this normal in years, and it means so much.\" The iOS app is just 1 more advancement that allows our customers to enjoy simplicity, freedom and healthier lives through our innovative technology. And as previously communicated, we remain on track to launch the Omnipod 5 iOS app with G7 in the U.S. and are planning to bring this integration to market in the first half of 2025. Internationally, we are making great progress with our recent launches of Omnipod 5 in France and the Netherlands and, although early, Omnipod 5 is starting to build a growing number of new users in both markets. We are on track to launch Omnipod 5 in additional countries starting in early 2025. We are also excited to expand our international offerings with additional sensor of choice, further launching Omnipod 5 integrated with FreeStyle Libre 2 Plus and introducing the integration of G7 in the first half of 2025. Turning now to our customer base and market leadership. We continue to set the standard and be an industry leader with Omnipod 5. By the end of the third quarter, approximately 90% of our U.S. customers were already using Omnipod 5, as were approximately 25% of our international customers. This is a testament to the power of Omnipod 5. It wins everywhere it goes. Our strategy remains focused on bringing people out of multiple daily injections onto Omnipod therapy. MDI users are our target market and present a large opportunity as we continue to rapidly increase our customer base and drive overall market expansion. Our growth in the third quarter was driven by increasing new customer starts from MDI. As a result, over 85% of our U.S. new customer starts came from people previously on MDI. We remain the clear market leader due to the highly differentiated nature of Omnipod. We have two decades of experience and investments that have led to our growing economies of scale. We have distinct and sustainable competitive advantages, including world-class manufacturing, which allows us to produce tens of millions of high-quality safety-critical pods. Adding to our scale, during the quarter, we celebrated the grand opening of our state-of-the-art Malaysian manufacturing facility, which provides further flexibility and strengthens our capabilities. Additionally, widespread access through the U.S. pharmacy channel is an important value proposition for our customers. This was a multiyear journey requiring significant investments to build the specific expertise and deep infrastructure we have today. We are proud that our time and investments have paid off, with nearly 100% of our pods now sold through the pharmacy channel, with the number of HCPs writing scripts for Omnipod 5 growing to over 22,000. We are excited about where we sit today and the significant growth catalyst that we expect to drive further long-term value creation. With that, I will turn the call over to Ana to walk you through our results and guidance. Ana Maria Chadwick : Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Our global team continues to execute on our mission, and we delivered another quarter of strong financial results. Third quarter results exceeded our expectations. We achieved 25% revenue growth, driven by total Omnipod growth of 26%. Our estimate global retention remained stable, and utilization was slightly higher than prior year. As Jim mentioned, we grew both global and U.S. new customer starts sequentially. Foreign currency had a favorable impact on total company reported revenue of 30 basis points versus our guide. U.S. Omnipod growth was 23%, finishing near the high end of our guidance range, driven by ongoing strong demand for Omnipod 5. Our U.S. revenue growth continues to be primarily driven by increased volume resulting from our success expanding our customer base. And the Omnipod 5 integration with G7 is quickly gaining momentum. We are excited about the opportunity that our Omnipod 5 type 2 label expansion brings to drive further growth in our business. We are seeing an uptick in type 2 new customer starts following the FDA clearance, which, given the nature of our annuity model, we expect to contribute meaningfully to revenue starting in 2025. Lastly, U.S. utilization trends were consistent with the prior year. Turning to International, where our team delivered another impressive quarter and once again sizably exceeded our expectations. In Q3, we drove growth in all of our international markets. We achieved International Omnipod revenue growth of 35%, primarily fueled by continued strong demand for Omnipod 5. Last year's launches in the U.K. and Germany are driving growth in revenue and new customer starts. And while still early days, we are seeing increased demand for Omnipod 5 in France and the Netherlands as well as for our recent integrations with Libre 2 Plus. While volume is the largest contributor to revenue growth, International revenue also benefited from higher pricing as new and existing customers adopt Omnipod 5. International utilization trends remained slightly elevated versus the prior year due to higher initial Omnipod 5 orders, similar to what we saw following the U.S. Omnipod 5 launch. We remain well positioned for further growth with more Omnipod 5 launches starting in early 2025. On a reported basis, foreign currency was favorable 130 basis points over the prior year and 230 basis points versus our guide. Drug Delivery revenue was $10 million, which was above our guidance range due to an increase in orders from our partner. Gross margin was 69.3%, up 150 basis points, primarily driven by pricing benefits in both the U.S. pharmacy channel and our international markets as well as ongoing improved manufacturing efficiencies. We continue to drive margin expansion as we scale and execute on our initiatives to drive operational excellence across our business. Operating margin of 16.2% and adjusted EBITDA of 23.2% both exceeded our expectations, driven by our strong revenue and gross margin performances as well as the operational leverage we are realizing throughout our business. From a tax perspective, last quarter, we discussed the release of a portion of our valuation allowance. In the third quarter, we released an additional $12 million, resulting in a noncash tax benefit in the period, which has been adjusted out for non-GAAP purposes. We anticipate releasing the remaining balance of $15 million in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect our 2024 non-GAAP effective tax rate to be in the range of 20% to 25% and for this to be the rate in 2025 as well. Turning to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with approximately $900 million in cash and the full $300 million available under our credit facility. Our commitment to drive margin expansion, profitable growth and positive free cash flow is paying up, resulting in our ability to invest in our business and strengthen our overall financial profile. Now turning to our outlook, starting with our fourth quarter revenue. We expect total Omnipod revenue growth of 13% to 16% and total company growth of 12% to 15%. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect growth of 9% to 12%. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter of 2023, we benefited from two stocking dynamics, totaling an estimated $30 million to $40 million. On a normalized basis, underlying growth in the fourth quarter of 2024 is expected to be approximately 21% in the midpoint of the guidance range. For International Omnipod, we expect growth of 30% to 33%. On a reported basis, we now assume a favorable foreign currency impact of 100 basis points. Finally, we expect fourth quarter Drug Delivery revenue to be approximately $7 million to $8 million. As a result of our fourth quarter revenue expectations, we now expect the following for the full year. We are once again raising our expectations for total Omnipod revenue growth to a range of 21% to 22% and total company revenue growth to a range of 20% to 21%, putting us over $2 billion of total revenue for the year. For U.S. Omnipod, we are raising the low end of our revenue guidance range and now expect growth of 19% to 21%. For International Omnipod, we are raising our revenue growth expectations to a range of 25% to 27%. On a reported basis, we now assume a 100 basis point tailwind from foreign currency. Our outlook for our International business is strengthened by the success we are achieving with Omnipod 5, which has resulted in significant revenue outperformance and are raising International Omnipod full-year outlook by 1,700 basis points since the start of 2024. Lastly, for Drug Delivery, our outlook has improved, and we now expect a smaller decline in the range of 5% to 10%. Turning to 2024 gross and operating margins. Given our strong performance to date and confidence in our outlook, we now expect gross margin to be approximately 69%. We also remain committed to driving further operating margin expansion as we continue to gain efficiencies across our organization and improve our operating leverage. Even as we continue to heavily invest for the long-term profitable growth. As a result, we are once again raising operating margin guidance another 50 basis points to approximately 14.5%. In closing, Insulet continues to be the market leader. Our expanding profitability and free cash flow drive our ability to continue to invest in our many growth catalysts. Our cascade of innovation and market expansion strengthen our long runway for sustainable profitable growth. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Travis Steed from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Travis Steed from Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Robert Marcus : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Congrats on a really nice third quarter. My one question. This quarter, Europe really stood out. Sizable beat, you said it was #1, new patient winner, and pricing helped. So I just wanted to help clarify a few things. Is that #1 in just the countries you're selling in? Or is that #1 overall in Europe? Which would be really impressive. How do we think about the magnitude of new patient growth? And if you want to throw U.S. in there as well, happy to hear that. And how do we think about the benefit of price and how sustainable is that? And how much more is to go in Europe? Thanks a lot. Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Robbie. Thanks for the question, and thanks for your congrats. The #1 is in the markets we serve in Europe. So that's -- so we're #1 across. And the reason we think that's impressive is because, of course, we don't have Omnipod 5 yet in all the markets we serve. So in the countries where we're present internationally, Omnipod 5 is the #1 pump. And so we had a really strong quarter that way. The magnitude of the growth has been terrific. So U.K. and Germany continues strong. Netherlands and France are really just ramping, and we expect that to continue. So we're really pleased with the new customer starts growth in Europe. And you had a second question on the U.S. I'm going to turn to Ana, but maybe somebody can remind me what the second part of the U.S. was. Ana Maria Chadwick : Yes. Maybe I'll touch on pricing in International. The way to think about it is markets where we've been present with Omnipod 5 a little bit longer, like the U.K. and Germany, are getting to that anniversary time period. So just to remind you, where we've launched Omnipod 5, we've gone to those health ministers -- ministries, and they have given us a premium for that because they see the value. And we anticipate that as we go to new markets -- by the way, France is early stages, but we'll be rolling out in another 10 markets as we move into 2025 here, we anticipate some countries will be going through their annual cycle, not having that bump in a year-over-year variance, but new ones are going to be ramping up. So bottom line is we anticipate to see price accretion in the international markets as we move into 2025. Maybe the other part of the question? Robert Marcus : It was just on magnitude of new patient growth. Jim Hollingshead : Yes. So new patient growth in Europe was stable in the quarter, which was terrific, because we would normally see some cyclicality, some seasonality in the summer months in Europe. So stable, really strong new customer starts with France, in particular, are just beginning to ramp. So we were pleased with that. And then in the U.S., we had really good new customer starts, clear and strong sequential growth in the U.S. in both type 1 and type 2 with -- leading the way with MDI. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jeffrey Johnson : Thank you. Good afternoon. Look, I don't want to steal Larry's 2025 guidance question. So let me start with a higher-level question, if I could. Jim, over the past year or two, in the U.S., I think we've been adding probably four to five points of T1 penetration each year and maybe 0.5 point or a bit more T2. When I look at your business or maybe even more broadly, I guess, across the industry, when I think about manufacturers, when I think about payers, when I think about HCPs, is the bandwidth there that a T2 annual penetration moves to two or three points in a year or 2? Does four to five points of T1, two to three of T2, does that equal 6, 7 points of penetration each year for the market? Or is that going to be something less because one plus one isn't two because there's, I don't know, prior auth headwinds, there's capacity constraints on manufacturing front, doctors only have so much care time. Can the industry really handle kind of this potential uptick in T2 and keep the T1 penetration going at the same pace it's been going here in the last year or two? Thanks. Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Jeff. That's a great question. It's a little bit of a complicated question. So let me just answer it from our point of view and what we're doing. We continue to lead and extend type 1. We continue to drive MDI growth in type 1, where they're very clear leaders. So we intend to continue to be the leader and extend our lead in the type 1 market, which, of course, drives penetration because we're the player that's clearly leading in MDI and growing the market. On the type 2 side, we see that as an additive opportunity. The penetration in type 2 is very low for AID in type 2, and we saw a nice lift in September. So we feel really good about our position there as the first and only player with an indication for use in AID in the type 2 space. In terms of the penetration number, we can certainly grow both, and we will grow both. The type 2 will take some market development, but we're already seeing a lift. And we think, over the next handful of years, penetration can grow in type 2 2x or 3x over the span, maybe beyond. It's early days. And so we'll be leading and developing that market, and we'll continue to lead and develop both type 1 and type 2. Operator : Our next question comes from Travis Steed from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Travis Steed : Hey, thanks for getting me back on. Not to steal Larry's thunder, but I know you're not going to guide on 2025 on this call, but I would like a higher level, like to think about kind of the opportunity you've got with new patient starts in 2025 with type 2. Just kind of all the puts and takes on '25 that you're thinking at this point. And one of your competitors talking about competitive dynamics, would love to hear how you're thinking about the competitive landscape as you move into '25 as well. Thank you. Ana Maria Chadwick : Great. I'll start with the guidance and maybe Jim will jump in with some of these competitive dynamics. But we're really excited with our growth prospects and where we're here positioned as we're coming to an end here in the fourth quarter. We are -- as you indicated here, we're going to return to the industry standard of providing guidance as we get to the February marks of our annual cycles. And at that point, we'll be able to provide the best and most complete picture. But just to give you some color, and I'll start here with revenue, which is what drives our entire P&L here. You're very well aware of the cascade of innovations. Really, in the U.S., they really launched here in the second half. And that's where you've seen the sequential new customer starts uptake and those types of things. As you know, we're in the annuity model, so most of that revenue growth will come as we move into 2025. And then for the international markets, I started talking about some markets where we launched earlier, we'll go through that anniversary cycle and new ones will start ramping. So again, those are the key dynamics. I've touched already on a little bit of price in the international markets, where we're going to see greater strength in the U.S. We believe the majority of our growth will come from the base customer start that we're growing right now as we grow our NCS. So again, we feel very well positioned, and we'll provide you a lot more color as we move into February. Jim Hollingshead : Yes. Thanks, Ana. I'll just chime in on the competitive dynamic, Travis. We do have one competitor that comments a lot on the competitive dynamics in the market. And I'll just say, here's what we know. We have industry-leading retention that remains very high and stable. And with regard to that one kind of noisy competitor, we've actually, two quarters in a row now, seen an uptick of conversions coming from them on to Omnipod 5. So that's what we know. I would just remind -- and by the way, Omnipod 5 is so differentiated that we have continued to enjoy ever since launch competitive conversions coming on to the platform because patients find it easy to use. It has all the advantages we've talked about. But I'll just remind everybody that our focus is actually on driving growth in the market by focusing on bringing people who are on MDI, multiple daily injections, onto Omnipod 5 therapy. And we are the very clear leader in the MDI part of the market. In fact, I would -- ever since we launched Omnipod 5 in August of 2022, every quarter, we have added more patients coming off of MDI on to AID therapy with Omnipod 5 than all of our competitors combined, and that dynamic continues very clearly today. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Polark from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Michael Polark : Good afternoon. Thank you. I have a question on type 2, the commercial preparation there, maybe it's a two-parter. One, on the field force investment, can you quantify kind of cumulatively, when you get through this cycle, how much you're expanding the rep base by? That's part 1. Part 2 then is on the doctors side. I heard, in the U.S., 22,000 HCPs are prescribing Omnipod 5. I'm curious for like type 2, do you have a sense for how many of those folks have ever written a DASH script? Kind of just interested what the share of wallet opportunity might be for type 2 versus just getting those HCPs to write type 2 for the first time. Thank you so much. Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Mike. Great questions. I don't want to get into actually quantifying and say, headcount or spend. It's -- the spending is contemplated in our guide, in our margin guide. But what I -- let me try and answer your question this way, which is, what we're doing is we are extending our current commercial model into more accounts. And we've gotten a lot better during 2024 targeting according to opportunities. So you know that most of our call point, historically, has been with endocrinology practices. And what we're doing is taking our current commercial model into extending that into also high-writing PCP practices. And so maybe to put some scale in, I would say, we think, in our current call point, we reached roughly 30% or so of type 2 users who are on insulin-intensive MDI-type therapy. And as we extend into those high-writing practices, we get to north of 40% of those type 2 MDI insulin-using patients. Now we also will extend -- so our current call point treats some basal-only patients and that high-writing PCP has a higher mix of basal-only patients, and so we'll get to more of those patients as well. But that might give you a sense of the scale of the expansion here from reaching about 30% of those type 2 intensive users to about 40% of those type 2 users. And then just as a reminder, we've actually expanded the sales force. It's a very consistent thing for us to do to expand the sales force. So we've successfully done some expansion in '24, and now we're planning to extend the same very robust commercial model in Q4 and into '25. Operator : Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Danielle Antalffy : Hey, good afternoon guys. Thanks so much for taking the question and congrats on a really strong quarter here. Just a quick question. As we think about the Q4 guidance and how you're thinking about the U.S. Omnipod line item, specifically, it does come in at the midpoint below consensus, but you just beat the consensus number. So I just want to make sure we're considering everything in what is usually a seasonally stronger quarter from a deductible perspective and make sure I'm not missing anything there. Thanks so much. Ana Maria Chadwick : Great. Thanks, Danielle, for your question. Absolutely correct. At the midpoint, our U.S. Omnipod guidance is below consensus, and it reflects -- I just want to remind everyone, it's a 21% growth on a normalized basis for the stocking activities that we saw a year ago. But at the high end of our guide, we are in line -- the consensus falls within that line. And it reflects actually that U.S. Omnipod will have grown more than 20% in each quarter of the 2024 calendar year. We see a lot of great traction and drivers. We see the trajectory, and we're really well positioned here. Our guidance really reflects our best available information at the moment, and that's what we're giving you all. So we are very excited and very well positioned to be at the midpoint of our full-year guidance range at the 20% mark for U.S. Omnipod. Operator : Our next question comes from Patrick Wood from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Patrick Wood : Perfect. Thank you so much. Yes, just 1 from me, and apologies if you already hit this. We're all just juggling a lot of calls today. But the type 2 side of things, obviously, label cleared. You said that there was an improvement as you moved through the quarter. I'm just curious, initial feedback from patients. I know you've had some experience in that market already. But any learnings that surprised you that would have formed your thinking about what the ramp of that curve could look like as you move into next year? Just as you get your feet on the ground, how are you feeling it? And has there been anything that surprised you versus previous expectations? Thanks. Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Patrick, and thanks very much for the question. We did -- I would first -- I'll just say, I was so proud of our team because we didn't expect the label. We didn't expect the clearance until later in Q4, and we got it with a month to go in Q3. And so I was really proud of our team's ability to pull together and get everything done that we needed to get done to launch with clearance. And so that was terrific. And we did see a lift in September from MDI, the MDI patients that are coming from type 2. So it was a nice lift on the type 2 side. I think that what we've learned, both in the month of September, but also over the course of our Omnipod GO pilot, as we went into the practices and really tested that model out is that, first, there are just a lot of type 2 patients out there in the world who are on insulin therapy. They might be on a GLP-1, and they still struggle with glycemic control. They still have A1cs out of control. So there's a lot of demand there. And the SECURE-T2D trial showed really clearly that those patients can benefit the other thing we've learned is that those practices, maybe -- so I would say, high-writing PCP practices that maybe have not prescribed pumps historically, they really have a keen interest to understand AID technology. And they have an even keener interest once they see Omnipod because they have a preexisting conception that pumps are big, hard-to-use tubed things with cannulas and needles and so on. And when they see Omnipod, they see how simple it is. And we see that out in the market already as we promote, and we saw, interestingly, even with our investigators who took part in SECURE-T2D, that was one of the things that was really prominently mentioned by our investigation sites is how simple Omnipod 5 was for them and for many of them, how that was counter to their expectation. So those are pleasant surprises. And we're very, very bullish on continuing to develop that market and drive growth, given the need, the clinical need for people who are not controlled, even though they might be on insulin and maybe on a GLP-1 already, and given the interest that doctors are showing in the ease of use of Omnipod 5. Operator : Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Lawrence Biegelsen : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. And I guess, Jeff, is such a smart man. I do have a follow-up on the question Danielle asked earlier, but just a different angle here. So Jim, the Q4 underlying U.S. Omnipod growth, as you said, is about 21%, which does imply a deceleration from Q3 if we adjust for the stocking a year ago, I think, in Q3. So how should we think about the 21% underlying growth in the context of 2025? Does the type 2 launch help maintain or accelerate the U.S. Omnipod growth off of the Q4 underlying growth? Thank you. Ana Maria Chadwick : Yes. I'll start with that one. So again, growth over 20%, we're excited by that. The thing to remember is a lot of these NCS sequential and growth we're experiencing also out of our type 2. Given our annuity model, we're going to see more of that benefit as we progress through the quarters here into 2025. So that would be the main driver here for our confidence and our excitement as we move forward. I don't know if there's... Jim Hollingshead : Yes. I'll just add. As Ana said, we're -- our approach to this is to be very transparent with our best available estimates, and that's what we're giving you. We feel very confident in our guide. And if I go back to the new customer start dynamic, obviously, we had clear sequential new customer start growth in the U.S. At least, by the way, we would have had even without the lift in type 2. So we had clear sequential growth in NCS in type 1. We had clear sequential growth in NCS in type 2. And as we said in our prepared remarks, we expect to have -- and we said this last quarter. But as we said in our prepared remarks, we expect to have year-over-year growth for the second half in the U.S. So the dynamic is really clear. We're confident in our guide. The type 2 growth gives us even more confidence in our guide for Q4. But as you all know, with our annuity model, that revenue ramps into '25 will create a ramping effect. Operator : Our next question comes from Margaret Kaczor Andrew from William Blair. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. It's actually Jimmy on for Margaret tonight. I wanted to touch on operating margins. Really, really strong performance here this quarter. So maybe you can just talk to some of the points that are driving that leverage? And then as it relates to your confidence on sustaining that into next year? Ana Maria Chadwick : Thank you, Jimmy, for that. Great. No, we are very -- we have had delivered very strong margin growth, and we feel very strongly that we will continue. And as I've said before, we're benchmarking here to at least 100 basis points annually of that margin expansion. That's what we've said before, and we continue to believe that. Some of the key components of that margin, as you can tell here, came from the gross margin expansion we have had. In addition, the scale that we have has allowed us to get some leverage in the operating -- in the base operating expenses as well. So as we continue to grow, we anticipate growth in gross margin, and I have also mentioned this before. In gross margin, we anticipate the growth to be more moderate as we move forward. And the reason for that is we have benefited significantly in the U.S. from price appreciation as we have moved out of the DME into the pharmacy channel. And now, as Jim mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're really at 100% of our volume roughly coming in through the pharmacy channel. So that lift will be there going forward, but we have many other levers around efficiencies, around how we have the volumes come from Malaysia and a lot of other things. And in the international markets, we do anticipate some price accretion. So just to wrap it up here, we have benefits coming in from gross margin. And in addition to that, we have the leverage of our scale as we leverage our operating expenses. Operator : Our next question comes from Issie Kirby from Redburn Atlantic. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Issie Kirby : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask about the basal side of things. Obviously, you had a bit of a change in your strategy as flagged last quarter there. So just wanted to hear about what you're seeing from patients and providers on the basal side. Any sign that you're seeing patients who are on basal perhaps intensifying and moving on to Omnipod now that it's more available to them? And just on type 2 more broadly, I guess, any early learnings around retention and behavior for these patients? Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Issie, for those questions. Let me start with the basal side. We already -- we know we already have a number of physicians out in the market who have been writing Omnipod 5 for basal-only patients off-label before we got the indication for use. And Omnipod 5 is just so simple to use and is very, very well suited to those patients for a number of reasons. And we will obviously promote to those patients. The SECURE-T2D data showed really clearly that basal-only patients benefited. That population -- that study population had about 20% of the patients in it who are basal-only patients, and they have the same benefit as patients on -- that were on multiple daily injections. And so we know it's a huge benefit to them. And the question is, who's out there that's on insulin therapy that's not controlled? That's really the target market, and that would be both intensive users and basal users. And as we extend our reach into those high-writing PCP practices, we'll find more and more of those patients. So we're bullish on both sides of the type 2 market. On retention, that's a really good question. Our customer base does include a portion of type 2 patients. Our retention has remained strong. It's mostly type 1, but our retention has remained very strong. We do anticipate over time that what we'll see is that type 2 patients, they have a lot going on in their lives. They have a lot of comorbidities. I think we'll see different subsegments of type 2 patients. And so in different parts of the type 2 population, I think it's quite likely that we'll see different usage patterns and maybe some lower retention in parts of the type 2 population. But all of those patients are incremental to our business, first, I would say. So it's all additional volume and additional patient growth for us. And over time, we'll be building more and more customized offerings for type 2 patients, which is something we'll be doing over the next few months, several quarters. And really work with the type 2 patients to make their experience on Omnipod 5 just as simple as possible so we can give them the same kind of market-leading retention on therapy and experience of therapy that we've given all of our patients historically. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Kratky from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Mike Kratky : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking our questions. Can you provide some additional color on how much of a commercial impact you've seen, either positive or negative from some of the CGM integrations that have transpired this year, both within your own products or competitors getting a bit of a head start? How meaningful of an impact would you say these integrations are having on new starts or your existing customer base or any commercial dynamics? Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Mike. I'll start with that, and I don't know if Ana will want to add some commentary. Our sensor integrations have been terrific for us and for our patients. So in the middle of the year, in the U.S., we've launched our G7 integration. G7, obviously, very highly prescribed sensor in the U.S. market. We were really successful with that through specialty pharmacy and, obviously, are now fully in retail with the G7. And that's been a really material part of our new customer starts. We still start a lot of G6 patients as well in the U.S. market. So providing Choice of Sensors has been a big boon to our patients and for us and our new customer start growth. In Europe, obviously, we've launched in Europe initially with the G6 integration. And then we most recently launched a Sensor of Choice integration in the U.K. and the Netherlands. And so in those markets, the customer has a choice between the G6 sensor and the Libre 2 Plus Sensor. Those markets are both growing really well. And both of those -- both the Libre and the G6 integrations have done very well for us. And we're very excited, as we said in our prepared remarks, to be bringing the Libre 2 Plus Sensor integration by the end of the year to the U.S. So we'll have three sensors available to customers in the U.S. And every time we've launched a new sensor integration, it's been -- it provides more choice to our customers, which is obviously a benefit to them, but it's also given us tailwinds of growth. Ana Maria Chadwick : Maybe I'll just add a perspective with our most recent iOS launch here with -- it applies right now in the U.S. with the G6. But I mean the success that we're seeing with the amount of downloads to speed, how our customers are responding to it and everything, gives us even that greater confidence that we will continue in that path to have more of those available through iOS in the future. So I just wanted to add that commentary. Operator : Our next question comes from Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jayson Bedford : Good afternoon. Apologize to the background noise. So I have a clarification and a question. Just a clarification on the international strength. You mentioned the slight uptick in utilization. To be clear, there was no stocking benefit to quantify. This is just a natural occurrence when you launch Omnipod 5. That's the clarification. The question is, just on your user base in the context of pricing, if 90% of the U.S. users are on Omnipod 5, 25% in Europe, how high can your European base go in terms of Omnipod 5 adoption? Ana Maria Chadwick : Great. I'll take the first part here. In terms of our international strength and the utilization uptick, we view that nothing to do with stocking. This is entirely to do with when you launch the new product, similar to what we saw in the U.S., probably at a little smaller degree, but people just get maybe a couple of two orders at once just to get some backups for their usage later. So we're seeing some of that similar dynamic in the international markets where we've launched. Jim Hollingshead : Yes. Thanks, Jayson. I'll just -- on how high the usage of Omnipod 5 can go in our international markets, I would expect to see a very similar dynamic in international markets as we've seen in the U.S. market, which is Omnipod 5 becomes the AID of choice, including in our own customer base. And so over time, as we bring Omnipod 5 across our international markets, I think it will be, by far, the predominant used products in our portfolio. But it will -- there's a little care -- we've talked about this before. In Europe, people are on contracts. And so even converting from -- in most markets, even converting from DASH on to Omnipod 5, we'll wait for the contract period to come up. It's usually a four year reimbursement cycle for them. And so we won't see it move as quickly. But over time, we'll see Omnipod 5 is -- as our clearly leading offer in our portfolio in our international markets. And as we said, Omnipod 5 already, just with the markets we've launched in Europe, is the number one pump in Europe in the markets we serve. And so you can see the power of it. We expect to see really strong new customer starts as well as we get Omnipod 5 rolled out internationally. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Matt Taylor : Hi, thanks for taking the question. I guess I wanted to follow-up on the type 2. It's very exciting stuff. Your competitors put out some estimates with market research that they think the market could get to 25% penetration in a three to five year time frame for intensive type 2 in the U.S. And I guess, I was just wondering what your thoughts were on that? Do you agree with that number directionally? Do you think that's in the ballpark? Have you done any research to confirm that? Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Matt. It's a great question. We're very bullish on type 2. We have such a great opportunity with type 2. And we're the first to market with AID. And we're the first to market an only AID in the market, with the products that overtook all of the AID players in the type 1 market. And if anything, I have -- I think we have a clear right to win in the type 2 market because Omnipod 5 has all of the benefits. It's so easy use, easy to set up, available in pharmacy where patients get their insulin, easy access, pay as you go, all the things we talk about all the time. So I think we have a very, very clear right to win the type 2 space. The SECURE-T2D data is really remarkable. And so we're very bullish on it. I think we said earlier in Q&A that over the next handful of years, we think penetration could double or triple in the type 2 space. We'll be the player that does that. It's very clear that we're developing the market. We're the ones who lead the market right now. We're number one in the market right now. And we're very optimistic about growth in the space. It's early days. We'll see where we can take it, but we think there's a big growth for us over the next few years in type 2. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew O'Brien from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Matthew O'Brien: Good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question. Would love to talk about the pharmacy channel a little bit. You've had a competitor on the durable side in that space over the last few quarters. And then yesterday, your noisy competitor also mentioned that they just got their first contract signed. So can you just talk about your ability to defend your position in that channel? And then more specifically, on the pricing side, to make sure, because I know they're going to push on the pricing side once they get bigger and bigger there. How do you defend your pricing within the pharmacy channel? Thank you. Jim Hollingshead : Great question. Thank you. I'll just start by saying that we have a very strong position in the pharmacy channel. And the reason we do is because Omnipod fits the pharmacy channel so well. First is the product, the consumable is the pump. It comes in a box. You get it at the same place you get your insulin. And we have Part D reimbursement, which is the pharmacy benefit reimbursement. So the product is the channel. And it meets the needs of all the stakeholders in the channel. So it's very easy for patients to use. It's very easy for physicians to write because it's full pharmacy reimbursement. They can write a prescription. Often, they can write a prescription in a down -- in sort of a drop-down venue so that they can just send it to the local pharmacy. It's great for payers because we have very high member satisfaction for payers who -- for patients who go on Omnipod 5. And it's great for PBMs because we do so much volume through the channel that our PBM partners get a lot of revenue off of our rebate money. And so it's a great business system for us and for all of our stakeholders, and we're very strongly positioned. As far as price goes, those are negotiations. We negotiate our PBM contracts every year. We're very used to it. There's a win-win there for volume against rebates for us. We have great relationships. And this is a capability we've built up over several years, relationships and contracts. We have many, many contracts with PBMs in the industry. And just as a reminder to everybody, we signed our first PBM contract in 2016 -- sorry, no, let me correct that. We started the process and negotiations in 2016. We signed our first contract in 2017. So we've had contracts with PBMs now for more than seven years. We have a lot of experience in this space, and we're very confident in our ability to defend our position. Operator : Next question comes from Chris Pasquale from Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Chris Pasquale : Thanks. Can you guys have mentioned some of the work you're doing on fully closed-loop algorithms. It seems like, broadly, there's a push across the industry right now to develop offerings that would do a better job helping those patients who aren't quite as actively engaged with managing their own disease. Could you give us an update on where your work on that front stands? How you're thinking about it? Is this a solution for a narrow segment of users or something that has broader applicability? And then how close are you to having something that could be ready for commercial use? Jim Hollingshead : Yes. Thanks, Chris. As you know, we've talked publicly, we talked at ADA about two separate and parallel algorithm development programs. But let me just start by saying something about our current algorithm. The Omnipod 5 algorithm is a great algorithm. It produces fantastic results. You can see from our real-world evidence, which includes all of our users, in effect, that we see all corners of usage, we have industry-leading time and range with very low hypoglycemia. And so our current algorithm also responds really well to missed boluses. So when Omnipod 5 senses a missed bolus, it will deliver a significant percentage of total daily insulin to bring the patient back into range. So our current algorithm performs really, really well at a population level and for all the individuals using it. Now having said that, we have two programs working on different areas with different concepts. One of which, I would say, is closer to a fully closed-loop algorithm. But two, both of them have been accelerated because of all the evidence we get off of actual patient usage. So even after the first 30,000 patients on Omnipod, which was quarters ago, we were able to see patterns of usage that allowed us to do in silica simulations. So we use our data sciences and big data capabilities to simulate adjustments to the algorithm, and that's what's allowed us to get into early clinical trials with two different algorithm programs that we've shared some of that data over the course of the last year. So we see real opportunity to drive improved algorithms and with a couple of different approaches, and we're happy to be able to accelerate that program. But we also know we're delivering great glycemic control and outcomes in the market right now. Operator : Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you so much for taking the question. I'm curious with just about a couple of things. Where to start? I think I'm just going to start with the impact of integrating Libre and G7. I mean does that create sort of a step-up opportunity for you in terms of new patients? And can you confirm, did you have positive new patient starts this quarter? Or is that more of a fourth quarter event year-over-year? Thanks. Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Joanne. We -- yes, the integrations with the sensors help us. They give us tailwinds. G7 has been an obvious tailwind for us in the U.S. with our new customer starts. And then the Libre 2 Plus launches have been tailwinds for us in the U.K. and in the Netherlands. So those are positive for us. And as we bring the Libre 2 Plus integration to the U.S., we think that will create another growth tailwind opportunity for us. And then in terms of growth, we have really clear sequential growth in new customer starts in the U.S. in both type 1 and type 2. MDI grew for both type 1 and type 2. And we expect to see, as we promised last quarter, we've said all year, we would have sequential growth every year. We delivered that in Q3. In Q4, in the U.S., we will see sequential growth that will also be year-over-year growth in new customer starts and, collectively, Q3 and Q4 in the U.S., we expect very clearly to have year-over-year growth for the second half based upon that dynamic. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Miksic from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Matt Miksic : Hi, thanks so much for taking the question. So I wanted to -- you mentioned the retention rate and, obviously, leading in new patients starts. I think, Jim, you talked about overtaking the other players in the space with this -- with your pump format. Can you talk a little bit about how you measure retention? And how, if at all, investors can kind of get a sense of how that's trending, if it's just rock solid in the mid to upper 90s or if it moves around a bunch? Any color would be appreciated. Thanks. Jim Hollingshead : Sure. Thanks, Matt. First, let me start with the data. The vast majority of our users in the U.S. market are on Omnipod 5. So that's cloud data. So it's very high fidelity. We can tell when somebody has started. We can tell when somebody has stopped. So we have really clear data on this. Our retention remains really high. And so it runs in the, I'm going to say, the low 90s. I will look around the room and make sure that's right. So it runs in low 90s, and it's very stable. It really doesn't move very much period-over-period. It's a very, very stable thing. We're very focused on creating and delivering an experience with our customers that makes it really easy for them to stay on, and we're going to build and continue to build capabilities in that area. But that's to give you a sense of it. It's very stable. It's very high. Very predictable. Operator : Our last question will come from Bill Plovanic from Canaccord. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Bill Plovanic : Yes, great. Thanks. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. I'd like to just shift gears. I mean if you've been launching the AID system and just trying to understand the impact you've seen on the commercial organization. I know you're scaling up to maybe go after different customer channels. But what has been the impact on the service to the patients? And has this been lessening? With the thought of potentially has this been lessening over time, where you're focused kind of more on selling than -- and less on kind of servicing the patient on an ongoing basis? Thanks. Jim Hollingshead : Thanks, Bill. That's a great question. Actually, we're really focused on building a completely differentiated end-to-end customer experience. In fact, the way we talk about this internally is that's actually what we deliver to people. We deliver an end-to-end customer experience that starts with the moment they might be diagnosed or they might be -- their child might be diagnosed, all the way out to pods for life. And we have, I think, a unique opportunity and a unique capability to do that because of the cloud connectivity of Omnipod 5. And so I think our customer service, our customer care, our product support are all really world-class. What -- I'll just say that when we launched Omnipod 5 in the U.S. in August of 2022, you all might remember, that actually, we had so much demand that, for a period of time there, we had trouble answering the phones. And so there was -- when we started, there was so much demand that we had not really appropriately scaled to support our customers as they got on product and they got trained. Those days are behind us. We've got -- we've scaled our commercial capabilities. We've scaled our customer care. We've scaled our inside sales. We've scaled our product support. And we're laser-focused on building the best end-to-end customer experience for users of Omnipod now and in the future over time. We're really excited about our unique opportunity to do that. Operator : I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back to Jim Hollingshead. Jim Hollingshead : Thank you all for joining us today. We have strong sustainable competitive advantages that allow us to deliver market-leading technology, market-leading growth and a strong financial foundation that positions us to continue to drive long-term value creation. Our type 2 label expansion is a game-changer and another major milestone for all stakeholders, including investors, employees, HCPs and most importantly, our customers. I'm proud of the work our team is doing to disrupt the diabetes market and improve the lives of people with diabetes. We have a clear strategy to expand the Omnipod 5 platform, drive growth in the U.S. in both type 1 and type 2 and accelerate international growth and expansion. We continue to make significant progress in each of these areas and have strong momentum across our organization. I want to thank all of our Insulet employees for their dedication, passion, and deep commitment to further our mission to simplify and improve the lives of people with diabetes around the globe. Thank you everyone for joining us today, and we look forward to updating you next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",
